2	reviews_aug07_parsed/12127_000122.txt	Zyrtec	5	3	1	In the beginning , Zyrtec helped a lot .    I only needed to take half a pill.I did experience drowsiness throughout the day and had occasional , minor problems with sleep .    I also had minor weight gain in the stomach area , but am not certain if it is linked to the medication since I seem to be eating more .    After about 7-8 months , the medication became increasingly ineffective even though I started taking a whole tablet .    I recently stopped taking it in order to see an allergist and have developed hives/itching which I have not had before .    Is this withdrawal ?	1

24	reviews_aug07_parsed/12127_000081.txt	Zyrtec	1	1	1	My 10 year old son was taking Zyrtec everyday for 18 months for eczema symptoms .    It worked great on his skin .    But ... he gained a lot of weight , he was hungry -LRB- starving -RRB- all of the time .    He would yell I 'm hungry from his bead in the morning and wanted to eat until bedtime .    He was tired no matter how much sleep he got .    He was fatigued and did not want to be very active or could n't be physically active for very long without tiring .    He was irritable and very emotional/depressed .    The symptoms came on gradually over the summer , so we thought it was some kind of growing issue .    I read online that Zyrtec can cause major depression in kids , so he stopped taking it .    Within days we saw drastic changes .    He was not as hungry and he said `` Mom I do n't feel so sad inside anymore . ''    He has been off the meds for 6 months , has lost almost all of the fat that he put on -LRB- it was cellulite-like fat -RRB- , he 's happier and he 's full of energy and playing outside a lot !    He had a bad skin flare up a few months ago , so I gave him 1 pill thinking that it would clear the skin , but no side effects would show up from that 1 pill .    The next morning , he yelled from his bed , I 'm hungry !    Then , he cried and said how stressed out he was before school .    NEVER again will he take Zyrtec .    We reported this to his dermatologist who told us that he actually does clinical studies for Zyrtec and he had never heard anything like this .    I think it 's because it comes on so gradual in the beginning that you do n't even know that it is the medicine that is effecting your child so negatively .    If your child gets heavy and does n't want to do anything anymore and feels sad , take him off Zyrtec and see what happens .	1
25	reviews_aug07_parsed/14492_000156.txt	Levaquin	5	1	1	Levaquin was prescribed for a sore on my arm that would not heal with other antibiotics .    I started taking it on Nov 29,2007 and by Dec 7 , 2007 was experiencing tendonitis symptoms in both ankles .    The rest of the month I shuffled in order to walk .    The morning of Dec 30 I awoke feeling better and decided to go for a walk on the beach .    As I was walking I heard a pop and felt a hot burning in my left calf .    I managed to walk off the beach .    I advised by Dr and was given Skelaxin which at least allowed me to walk but still with a limp .    In March I asked my doctor to do and MRI and was told that I had a torn muscle and tendon in my left leg .    Per my DR. surgery is not a viable option as the surgery does not usually give a good result .    He states it could take a year for the muscle and tendon to heal .    Meanwhile , my normal life is on hold .    LEVAQUIN IS A VERY DANGEROUS DRUG .    I personally feel it should be taken off the market .	1

What negative side effects are from Tegretol or Geodon I do n't know but I have a lack of energy now , finding the right words is tough , loose balance sometimes , and most of all is scary that my heart feels like it races at times and a slight crushing pain in the rt side of chest now and again .    It feels different than anxiety symptoms .    I have been on it for 6 weeks .    Considering switching but all have some side effects like weight gain and severe drowsiness .    I am a light weight on drowsiness .    I hate to change again and miss more summer or risk paranoia .    I take it for bipolar I -LRB- affective -RRB- disorder with psychotic features .    Hope that helps .	1

After 3 months and 100 mg dose per day up from 50 mg which did n't do anything , I started getting extremely extremely ill .    Now , I will note that for about a month or so I felt a huge difference and It was effective in reducing my anxiety/depression however the side effects ending up being detrimental .    I had to have an endoscopy -LRB- camera down throat to see stomach -RRB- to prove the medication irritated my stomach .    Zoloft caused extreme nausea , no appetite .    It was horrible , and I threw up for 2 months ever morning because I was taking the zoloft before I went to bed .    Long story short , the drug caused excess stomach acid to build up , created irritation , and made me throw up for months and feel waves of nausea hit me like a brick in the middle of the day .    After being off of it for 1-2 months my stomach is still not back to its normal calm state .    I have switched to Remeron which so far is helping -LRB- very mildly -RRB- but with zero side effects !    It is helping my appetite since the zoloft made me on the verge of being extremely underweight , and I was already thin to begin with .    Also , I currently take `` lansoprazole '' which works wonders for me -LRB- prilosec does n't work for me -RRB- it is a 24 hour acid reducer .

Also on Hydrocodone every 6 hours or as needed .    I am not that impressed with this .    He spoke of this being a wonderful drug to bring down swelling and that has n't happened .    And when taken with the Hydrocodone , I get so `` drugged '' I can not function .    Even my 11 year old commented on how `` close to dead '' I looked after taking the 2 together as prescribed .

112	reviews_aug07_parsed/4575_000030.txt	warfarin	5	1	1	This is a very dangerous drug .    It caused my blood to get so thin that I ended up in the hospital for 3 days , since my kindeys were bleeding and I was urinating blood .    I had followed the correct dosage -LRB- 5 mg/day -RRB- and took a PT test at the doctor 's office each week .    For the first 2 weeks everything was fine , then in the thrid week I was in the hospital with the bleeding .    It took 3 days in the hospital and another 3 at home for the blood to wash out of my kidneys .    They also had to give me 2 units of plasma in the hospital .    The problems caused by this drug were much worse than the potential benefits .    I had been given it as a preventitive medicine only , after an AF episode .    I would urge anyone taking this to discuss the risks with their doctor .    I am off this drug and will never take it again .	1

My acne which was n't too bad to begin with but very persistent for 2 yrs .    My skin did clear up after about 2 weeks , but I developed a terrible yeast infection so strong that it passed to my husband !    It caused excruciating vaginal pain after intercourse and constant mild pain .    Not worth it to me , i think a financially driven rushed FDA approval has put a dangerous drug on the market that is being pushed on Doctors and their patients .    I was n't told of the side effects , in fact I was told that they were nothing to worry about .    I even asked if it could cause yeast infections since it is an antibiotic and my Dermatologist said no !    I immediately stopped taking this after research .

She was in septic shock and I had 4 people as well as her physician at 11 pm ask me if I knew what her final wishes were .    Somehow she managed to pull through after several days in the ICU .    Needless to say , she no longer has that physician -LRB- not the one that called me -RRB- and I am a very greatful person to still have my mom .    PLEASE , if you begin to get even SMALL infections , PLEASE consider stopping the use of this medicine .    I dont want another family to go through what I did .    I know there is a great risk with the med and mom and I both spoke about them .    Yes , the results of the Remicade helped her but in the same breath , almost killed her .

This all started Jan. 09 and it 's May 09 .    Each change involves about 5 weeks before the dose gets changed .    I 've been extremely frustrated with the results .    There has not been a day that I have not had PVC 's .    They might be less strong but not by much .    I take the meds faithfully yet still wonder why I bother .    I see a cardiologist and am told that although it is bothersome it 's not going to kill me .    If it 's not going to work for me then I may as well just live with the palps since I 'm still getting them anyways .    I do n't really want chemicals in my body that are not doing any good .    i know this drug works very well for some patients but for me it 's not doing its job .	1

I have to go off of it because I can not take the side effects .    Dry mouth , tremors , anxiety attacks and the worst headache of my life that has not gone away in 5 days .    I can not even open my right eye for more than a few seconds because the pain is so intense .    I was taking 150 mg for the first week and then the second week I went up to 150 mg twice a day .    My skin started to crawl , I turned mean as a snake and yelled at everyone .    Forget sleeping .    I have had none in over a week .    All I do is lay in bed and pray that this intense pounding in my head will go away .    I know some people think that you need to give it more time , but before I was taking this I was just a bit down feeling .    Now I am both depressed and anxious and in constant pain and I ca n't even leave my house .    So my experience with this drug has not been a good one at all .    Now I am worrying about any repercussions I may have coming off of it .    Hopefully , since I was not on it but a few weeks the withdrawal will not be too bad .    If you suffer from any type of anxiety disorder I would strongly suggest that you do NOT take this medication .	1

All of a sudden , I missed my period and have gained weight , I 'm fatigued , I have a constant headache , and sore breasts and found lumps 3 days ago .    I got Mirena to stop having irregular periods but it did n't work now they 're just long , I 've never had a pregnancy scare-until now .    My doctor has already warned me that removal without strings will be painful since they will have to `` blind-probe '' because sometimes the ultrasound ca n't help guide them .    If you are considering Mirena please think about it thoroughly especially if you are breastfeeding because the hormones do go into your breastmilk and can affect your child .

I followed their advise and ignored the warnings and ended up angry that this drug was ever approved and at those who try to make those who had bad experiences appear to be whiners .    I have to wonder if they actually work for Amgen , considering the sheer volume of us I 've found online .    Something is seriously wrong here .    One week after my shot -LRB- October 2012 -RRB- I had an infection of the jawbone and it only went downhill from there .    I was sick , in and out of my doctor 's office and the hospital for 6 months , but it did n't end there .    i had bone infections , pain in my thigh , lung infections , shingles , anemia and caught everything that was within 15 miles of me .    I 'm pretty sure that my immune system was completely shut down and is still , eighteen months later only working at 1/4 of what it used to be .    I took this drug to prevent fractures , but it robbed me of my life for at least six months .    i do not think the cost was worth it and am pretty much convinced now that this is a scam and we are the guinea pigs .    They had to cancel the trials on multiple myeloma patients because 2x as many of them died when using Prolia .    I 'm not sure why some have reactions and others do n't , but I think it is highly questionable to allow these drug dealers to put this out there without having a clue .    To make it appear as though the side effects are a minimal risk when clearly they are not and to give the impression that the side effects are harmless when they are debilitating -LRB- which my OP was not -RRB- is at best disingenuous .    I would never take this drug again and my doctor agrees .	1

The only good thing from it is that my periods are now regular and I do n't have to worry about taking a pill everyday .    Downside is right before I start my period I get cramp like feelings on my right leg , it lasts about 15 min then goes away later comes back .    At first I thought it was just cramping but tylenol or anything of that nature does not help .    Even when I 'm not on my period I randomly get cramps as if I was going to start , but do n't .    I 'd like to get it removed but I do n't have insurance or the money to .    So I 'm pretty much stuck with it until I get insurance or money .    But if you 're thinking about getting it make sure its the right one for you .	0

He was so messed up from it that he could n't remember how many pills he had taken , and took more .    55 years old , with no health problems , and DEAD !    This medication should be BANNED imediately .    My son use to complain about how I made him `` STOP '' taking his meds ... .    I have n't heard a thing since his dad died .    I know he appreciates what I did , even though he was n't happy about it in the beginning .    If you have any other alternatives , use them .    This med is dangerous and deadly .    Try medical marajuana !    I may be weird , but I believe that it is natural , and safer than anything out there .    My son refused to try it , and then last year , he did at 33 y/o .

It was as if a part of my mind was spinning out of control and I was helpless to do anything about it .    It was clearly a bad reaction to sertraline because I 've never in my 53 years experienced that type of bizarre anxiety .    I know full well what panic attacks are , and I 've dealt with varying degrees of anxiety for decades .    But this was completely new to me and scared the living hell out of me .    After switching to Celexa , my side effects almost immediately abated and my depression lifted within several weeks of therapy .    So the moral of the story , obviously , is that everyone 's brain receptors work differently , there is no test to determine the best drugs for those receptors , and so careful monitoring and switching of drugs when called for is the best and only course of action .	1
271	reviews_aug07_parsed/35_000695.txt	Lipitor	1	1	1	I 'm glad that I finally ran into a forum that discusses Lipitor side effects .    I was on the drug for about 8 years and during that time I was being tested for rheumatoid arthritis and other issues related to extremely sore joints and muscles .    I was then diagnosed with fibromyalgia .    Then I was given a drug to help with the pain and then that drug was taken off the market because of side effects .    About 9 years ago I finally went to a doctor that believed in holistic health and he took me off the Lipitor .    I was almost afraid to do it because my family doctor believes it is a miracle drug .    I thought ... oh well , a few months is n't going to hurt .    It took about 6 months but I was back to my normal activities with no more pain .    I am now seeing a Cardiologist who believes in alternative medicine .    He has me on supplements that have made my cholesterol go lower than the Lipitor ever did .    I was so thrilled the first time that I got my results that I cried and then I felt anger that I had suffered for so long from the Lipitor .    I take fish oil , COQ10 , red yeast rice -LRB- Cholestene -RRB- and lipitrol -LRB- all supplements -RRB- .    I came to this site because my husband is suffering with neuropathy in his feet and I am convinced that it is the Lipitor .    I hope that he will finally agree to try going off the `` poison '' and see if there is any change .    Is n't it interesting that the cholesterol norm used to be 300 and as soon as the statins were put on the market , the norm gradually kept getting lower and lower .    Does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the lower the norm , the more the patients , the more profit !    Feels good to vent about this but it is scary thinking of all the harmful consequences from this drug .	1

Went to a hospital in a little German town ; after determining I had an infection , this drug was given to me .    Almost immediately , my hearing got funny ; I did n't seem to be getting any better .    Then a leg muscle got really sore and curtailed my walking on the trip .    The cough worsened ; I stopped taking after five days .    Would never take this again under any circumstances .

I was hallucinating , thinking I saw shadows that were n't there , or hearing muffled talking and just a general feeling of anxiety and a weird nervousness like something horrible was about to happen !    Once I fell asleep , I displayed sleepwalking behavior .    My boyfriend told me I was in like a weird trance with my mouth hanging open while I was sitting up .    He has guages in his ears , and I started rubbing and touching his earlobe .    He said once he sat up and looked at me confused , I started saying `` I 'm fixing it , I 'm fixing it , I 'm just fixing it '' .    Another night , I woke up with the ZzzQuil bottle emptied ... Not sure if I drank it or poured it out or what .    My boyfriend did n't know either .    I stopped taking ZzzQuil .    I have been googling ZzzQuil and sleepwalking and hallucinations , came across a lot of reviews that said they had hallucinated and such .    Found this review of a super scary and crazy experience too : http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=32271 - Take a small dose of ZzzQuil if you are going to try it .    I personally took the recommended dosage -LRB- have tried the caps and liquid -RRB- , and still had very odd experiences .    Please be careful with it , as you do not want to sleepwalk or do something you are not aware of that could potentially hurt you or someone you love .	1

I was home alone when these symptoms happened in my otherwise healthy body and was so frightened that I called a 24-hour nurse hotline for medical advice and was considering calling 9-11 .    VERY disturbing side effects just to treat acne .    These are the kinds of side effects * cancer * patients deal with when they are in treatment - It 's worth it in a life and death situation when you are fighting a terminal illness - NOT TO TREAT ACNE !    I did notice an improvement after just 1 day , but I will happily keep my acne over these side effects any day !    I read other users ' comments about hair loss/burning esophagus and will never touch this medication again .    Just to give an overview : I have been suffering from cystic acne only on my right cheek for about a year .    The trouble started shortly after an appendectomy , so I wonder if the issues are related .    I discovered through my own research that copper deficiency might be related to my surgery and acne , so I took copper/zinc pills for 6 months before Doryx with limited results .    Finally , I went to a dermatologist for care because my deep , painful acne with bad scarring was n't getting any better .    The dermatologist prescribed 1 % clindamycin topical solution , Epiduo and Doryx .    I am throwing the Doryx away and will never , ever , ever touch it again .    Shame on the Food and Drug Administration for approving such a horrible drug .    Maybe what 's most disturbing is that when I asked the dermatologist about the side effects , he just threw a paper at me and joked no one reads it anyway .    He gave me no instruction on how to take the medication and I 'm figuring everything out on my own .    I 'm so thankful for everyone 's reviews	1

Over the short period using it , the last month seemed a little painful after injecting .    Besides this , my hair started coming out when combed and now my scalp is extremely sensitive to te point that it hurts to even touch and bleeds when my index finger is on the scalp .    I decided to decrease my 3X weekly dosage to 2Xs and my last injection - I ca n't be sure , but it resulted in a severe reaction that occured during sleep .    I was buring up - my temperature felt like over 200 degrees and even worse my jaw was locked , my fingers became clamped and I began shivering like crazy .    Again , I ca n't be sure if it 's the Rebif medication , but this is the only new medication I 've been taking and if this is the case , I am not - CAN NOT go back on it .	1
324	reviews_aug07_parsed/1701_000018.txt	Amethia	5	3	2	Nine weeks ago my pharmacy switched my prescription from Camrese to this Amethia and it has been nothing but problems .    I have been annoyingly spotting for the last seven weeks on and off .    Horrible cramping , double over in pain from it and the nausea and vomiting is even worse .    I never had any of these problems while on Camrese .    I knew it was n't right to switch my birth control like that and I will either be switching to a new one all together or ask to be put back on Camrese .    A period for seven is ridiculous and I have been on either Seasonigue / Camrese since March 2011 .    Very dissatisfied with this drug .    I 'm honestly worried that if I was able to have sex with my boyfriend that it would n't work .    But I guess I have nothing to worry about since I 've had my period for the last seven weeks .	1

On Day 10 I could not get out of bed without help , I could barely walk , it was excruiating .    I had pain and swelling in my hands and fingers , there was n't a place in my body that did n't hurt like hell .    I had no strength overall .    My daughter had to help me to the toilet and put my socks on .    I could n't figure out what was happening to me .    The only thing that had changed was my taking the Levaquin .    I went online and found these reviews and a multitude of other website with warnings of side effects .    WHY , did n't my doctor warn me ??? If I had been aware , I would have recognized the side effects and STOPPED taking the meds immediately !!    I called him and told him I could barely walk and that I was unable to perform minimal tasks .    He said to stop taking it , which I did and to call back if I did n't feel better .    Well , its been 3 months since I stopped taking it and I 'm still experiencing severe pain , swelling , loss of strength , extremely tight tendons and fatigue .    I have a few ok days but it flares up badly with just a little physical activity .    Up until I took this medicine , I was a healthy , energetic 45 yr .    old woman .    No longer , thanks Doc and to the makers and pushers of Levaquin ... well , I guess what I 'd like to say would be flagged as inappropriate .    How long will this pain stay with me ?    My MD says it will take `` time '' , I dont ' have time to be in this much pain !	1

I was taken off Plaquenil which was very effective in controlling the lupus because of severe eye side effects .    Began treatment with Cellcept in Feb 2010 and it seemed to be very effective in treating my symptoms .    I was taking 1000 mg per day with no side effects .    In fact I had n't felt that well in many , many years and was pleased with the drug .    But by Dec. 2010 I suddenly became very sick with 105 * fever and severe back pain .    Both with no known cause .    After a few days in the hospital I was diagnosed with sepsis .    I had no obvious infection to lead to sepsis .    In fact the morning of when I was taken to the hospital until an hour before I fell sick I felt great .    I had a staph infection and staph is all over everyone 's skin .    It must have found a small cut to enter and my suppressed immune system lead to the sepsis .    It was a very scary situation .    I was hospitalized for 9 days and went home with a port for continuing the antibiotics for 4 weeks X 4 times a day .    I visit my Rheumatologist in April to decide what treatment I will try next .    I havbe a feeling it may still by Cellcept .    But I am terrified now of what may happen .    I read that cellcept caused sepsis in 2 % of users .    I was extremely healthy except for the lupus before this incident - other than lupus no other health problems .    Was very active , walked 3 miles everyday plus lots of other activities and responsibilities .    It has been 7 weeeks and I am still having problems from the sepsis .	1

If you can avoid narcotics all together for chronic pain try to .    Especially if you are younger , like myself , im 29 .    I do recommend it highly for short term use , it is very effective .

If you can find other ways to deal with the pain besides narcotics , do it .    But to stay on this long term is not a good idea .    I do blame my doctor for putting me on this .

Overnight , she went from an independent , fully functioning woman to someone who hardly knew me , and completely bed-ridden .    After 3 days of begging with the doctors that something else was seriously wrong with her , they finally did a complete set of tests and MRI .    Everything came back normal , so they decided to take her off of the Levaquin .    The next day she started showing improvement .    It has now been a month , and she is almost back to normal , after a lot of rehab .    The nurses at the hospital all said they had heard that Levaquin could do that to people , especially the elderly .    Beware of this drug - only use it as a last resort !	1

507	reviews_aug07_parsed/17879_000049.txt	Avelox	1	1	1	Doctors and Pharmacists should tell the patient all side effects prior to prescribing this medicine .    I experienced the side effects of depression , anxiety , rapid heart beat , confusion , and tremors within 4 days of taking this mediation .    I am also told that these effects will remain until the medicine leaves my system in a couple of weeks .    I needed to have known that this medication had these side effects .    If I had not noticed that something was not right and traced the symptoms back to after I began taking the medicine , it probably would have killed me or at the least caused some sort debiliitating condition .    I think this medication should not be prescribed to individuals who are not under the direct control and care of a physician and nurse .

I had to get 10 hours of sleep or I would not be able to function .    The first day my dose was too strong and I slept for 30 hours .    I fixed my dose but I still gained an annoying amount of weight .    But honestly the worst part was planning my entire life around when I would be able to basically pass out for 10 hours .    It is good for dire crisis situations .    When I got off it I had a suicidal episode and felt completely worthless .    Worse than any of the lows in my depression .

574	reviews_aug07_parsed/11492_000014.txt	User Reviews and Ratings - Lidocaine Viscous mucous membrane	1	1	1	I was prescribed this letdown of a medication for pharyngitis/tonsillitis .    The directions given to me were : `` Gargle with 1 teaspoon and a sip of water for 1 minute and spit out every 3 hours as needed . ''    I managed to gargle it for 20 seconds before gagging and almost throwing up .    Mine is cherry flavored , but even that did n't help .    The idea that this medicine is harmful if swallowed did n't assist in gargling with it .    The first difficulty was figuring out how to gargle for a full minute when I can only breathe out for 10 seconds at a time .    When I ran out of breath , I tried closing off my throat to hold the liquid , and then breathing in to continue the gargle .    Trying to keep this rhythm , all while trying not to swallow the medicine or get it into my airways , was extremely difficult .    After I spit it out , it made my mouth more numb than my throat .    It had a mild numbing effect on my swollen tonsils , but not nearly enough to justify the hassle of using it .    It still hurt like the dickens to swallow regular old saliva just moments after using the medicine .    Ibuprofen has been taking more `` edge '' off the pain than this medicine does .    Honestly , drinking hot tea and doing warm salt water gargles felt a lot better .    Not only is this medicine very hard to use , it 's hardly effective .    I 'll be sticking to plenty of fluids and OTC pain relievers until this sickness goes its course .    I would n't recommend this medicine to anyone .    Ask your doctor for something else !	1

I was crying constantly , always unhappy with my bf , crying to him about things then 5 mins later crying about how sorry I was that I got upset over something so stupid .    I was crying in the shower to hide it .    Then I read reviews online and immediately went to my gyno .    She said she had been writing prescriptions and pharmacies of her patients had been sending azurette and she was getting calls daily from women who were so confused about why their moods had changed so radically .    She started writing ` not azurette ' on her slips .

I lost 80 LBS , a ton of hair , and for the first and only time in my life , I became aggressive , paranoid , and my entire personality changed , for the worse , and I was diagnosed with Atrial Fib and mania as well as hallucinations .    I remain puzzled as to why I was put on this medication to begin with and when I asked my Dr. about it , she was unable to give me solid reasoning .    I weaned myself off of this medication slowly and have felt so much like myself , with no mania or aggression or hallucinations at all .    I am off of it now , and feel stable and healthy .    I would caution anyone who takes this med to ask family members to help them monitor themselves as it took me what seemed like eons to realize that this drug was behind my complete loss of personality .    I never suspected this drug because I was so happy with the weight loss .    Granted I had been working out and had put myself on a 1200 calorie a day diet , but I know this drug helped with killing my appetite .    I would gladly trade the weight loss to have not had to go through the only time in my life when I have experienced mania , aggression , and hallucinations .    Mostly , I am grateful to wake up now , and feel like myself again .    I would wish the side effects I had on no one .    I would also recommend asking the Dr. ahead of time , why he/she is prescribing this medication .    Had I had the foresight to do this , I might not have had to go through such an ordeal .

750	reviews_aug07_parsed/4154_000142.txt	Deltasone	5	1	1	I was very reluctant to take any corticosteroid , as I was worried about side effects .    It took more than 10 years of disease activity before I gave in and finally took it .    My doctor has prescribed it before , but prior to this year , I had never even filled the prescriptions .    I wish I would n't have given in .    I thought maybe I was blowing the risks out of proportion , as my GI doctor has told me numerous time that I was overreacting , and that the drug was the safest of any .    Prior to being treated with prednisone , I had suffered through my symptoms , or taken medication that only controlled my symptoms .    I was much happier with both of those options , as miserable as the disease can be .    I was n't depressed before , now I am .    I 've been off of the steroids a month now , and I still have menstrual bleeding that started 3 months ago when the prednisone was started .    It has been nonstop .    My doctor said it would stop , and that it was nothing to worry about .    Maybe she does n't feel like having a relationship with her husband , I desperately want one with mine .    My skin is now very oily and I have terrible acne .    I was told this would go away , but it 's getting worse .    My vision is blurry still , my eyes are dry and red , and they feel like they are filled with sand .    I was told this was caused by my disease , not the drug .    My eye doctor disagrees .    I was unable to sleep much despite being physically drained the entire time while on the medication .    It was awful .    Anti-anxiety medications did n't help .    I also started having trouble with weakness after starting the medication .    It was terrible .    I could barely walk to my bedroom .    My advice , if your gut feeling is to run from this drug , run , and run fast .    I had far less trouble with being on , and coming off of pain medication that I took to control the symptoms of my disease .    They said those were n't safe , but I had no ill effects during or after treatment .    They should be more cautious in prescribing this this as they are with pain medication .	1

When confronted about abuse of meds he lied and was in denial and it got worse he started a drug seeking behavior and I found him getting narcotic RX from doctor , and then found med that he would not tell where they came from , I sent him to our PCP for intervention and possibly to be addmitted to rehab and packed his bags to move out until he got it under control .    He did not have to be admitted and did go through withdrawls but did detox and today he is fine and will never take this medicine again .

Quite frankly , I 've resorted to severely restricting my food intake and though I 've dropped about 15 pounds , I 'm always - ALWAYS - hungry .    I miss my naturally fast metabolism ; now I reeeally have to work hard to maintain my physique .    I also have mood swings , debilitating depression and irritability just like I used to the day before my period except that now it 's pretty much all the time .

After just a few weeks -LRB- 3-4 -RRB- it made him stop sweating so we had to be very careful about him getting too hot so that he would not have a heat stroke .    His behavior changed dramatically .    He was fine one minute and then the next he was so very angry .    He would throw things and then he would just start crying like he was sad but he did not even know why .    My son never cries about anything !    He started having alot of screaming spells where he would just sream non-stop all day long !!    I went to this site and read some reviews where people said that it made them feel like they were going crazy .    I made the doctor change his medicine and as soon as we started lowering the dose his behavior started returning to normal.He could not focus on anything .    He could not concentrate long enough to tell you what his ABC 's were or to even do puzzles .    That was something that he really excelled at before this drug .    After just a month or so off the med .    his concentration returned and he so did all the knowledge that he had before .    I know several people who have taken this and it affecte them the same way .    this drug should at the very least have a warning label .    If it were up to me , I would pull it from the market .	1

I am a very active 21 year old female , and I rarely get sick or hurt .    A few days into taking this medication , I began having severe lower abdominal pains , nausea , and slight chest pains .    The stomach pains were so bad that they kept me up at night , at which point I felt like my heart was skipping beats .    I thought I was going crazy , but after reading the possible side-effects of Solodyn , I realize that it caused me to have an irregular heart beat .

I assumed the symptoms would clear up during the daytime .    On the ride to the tournament , I experienced severe nausea , dizziness , and anxiety .

Second hour : nausea , panic .    By the fourth hour , -LRB- I was 19 at the time -RRB- I was staying at my father 's home .    I could n't sleep .    Roughly around midnight , something snapped in my head .    I lost my sense of identity .    I did n't know who I was , where I was , etc. .    I used logic to get help : Assuming I was in a living room with a TV on and it was midnight , the owner -LRB- s -RRB- of the house would most likely be upstairs sleeping .    I went to the first door -LRB- luckily my father 's bedroom -RRB- and knocked .    When he answered , I distinctly remember saying , `` Excuse me Sir , but I do n't know who I am , where I am , or how I got here , but I 'm scared . ''    Immediately he got up , took me down to the living room and he tried talking to me .    By 6 am , I started shaking and could n't stop touching my face/forehead/head -LRB- sense of connectivity through anxiety situations -RRB- .    Father called hospital and doctor .    They said there was nothing to do but stop any further usage , and wait it out .    By 9 am , I regained my identity , but had horrible diarhea and tremors and panic .    That morning and afternoon , I felt I would never feel happiness again and said , `` Now I understand why people commit suicide .    If they felt like they would never feel another moment of happiness again , it makes sense . ''    I distinctly remember I asked if I could have a box of Kleenex and sit on the front porch -LRB- summertime -RRB- and I cried unexplainably for 6 HOURS NON-STOP !    It took 3 days before I felt it was out of my system .    I felt as though certain `` doors inside the innermost parts of my brain were unlocked and opened ; doors that were never meant to be opened .    Ever . ''    I 've never been the same since that paradoxical reaction from that ONE SINGLE PILL .    I never will willingly take an anti-depressant again .

I felt tired all the time and felt as though I needed to sleep constantly .    I stopped taking the medication on my own , against my doctor 's recommendation .    Coming off the med was difficult , in the first week after discontinuing I felt more emotionally unstable than I ever have in my life , much more so than before I began the medication .    It 's been over a month since I quit taking it , and even though I 'm working out 4 days a week and eating an extremely low calorie and low carb diet the weight is not coming off !    I 'm beginning to worry that this medicine has somehow caused me permanent obesity !    I will say that this may be an effective medicine for someone in an extreme crises situation , or in such a severe manic state that they 're willing to gain weight and possibly destroy their body in exchange for stabilizing their mood , as it does `` work '' in the sense that it prevents one from feeling just about anything !	1

I began having severe headaches .    I have always had headaches , but these we not bearable .    I also had extreme dizziness and even slight confusion .    I talked to my dermatologist after seeing on my file `` patient denies suffering from headache and/or dizziness '' so I mentioned to him that I did in fact have these symptoms and he reccomended that I see my eye Dr. , appearently this drug can cause elevated eye preassure .    I saw my eye doc and everything was fine , but then I began to have mild depression -LRB- which I later discovered that mental changes were reported with use of Minocycline -RRB- and visual problems as well , coughing , itching and I looked pale and underneath my eyes was extremely grey and my teeth which were extremely white were beginning to look brown and dull .    I decided that I woulod skip a few doses to see if it helped and after just a few days I feelt so much better .    I have decided that the overall effects of this drug are not worth the risks and the way it makes me feel .    Besides this , it does n't work much better than Proactive Solutions and is extremely expensive and I have to call every 3 months to set that discount card up .    I am not going to go back to my dermatologist , I am going to take vitamins and use Proactive ... I think that is much safer .    My acne is back , but I will find another way to deal with it , I just do n't think this drug is very safe , besides , I ca n't take antibiodics forever , they are n't good for you and the acne will just return . .    mine already has .	1

He is great during the day but for the first 2 hours of the day it is very difficult and at night he has to take a sleeping pill .	0

1183	reviews_aug07_parsed/164400_000090.txt	Tribenzor	3	3	1	I have been on this B/P med for 4 months .    Excellent med keeps my B/P at a constant low ranging from 90/70 to 106/62 .    Where previous it was HIGH ranging from 170/100 to 190/106 .    I too experience some lightheadness , some tiredness and dizziness .    However , I recently found out through a fasting blood test that this med may be affecting my kindey functions .    After reviewing the possible/rare side effects of this med I discovered that this med can cause kidney diease and/or kidney failure .    I will need to review other B/P med options with my MD any get off this med as it is causing my Creatine levels to be out of the normal range .    Normal range is .59-1.07 .    I am currently at 1.50 .    Which means if these numbers continue to increase to 2.0 only 50 % of my kindeys will be working .    Not good and very scarey .    Not all meds are good for you , even though they do the job !    Be aware and always stay on top of all your meds and possible/rare side effects that can cause damage down the road and or possible death .	0

I do n't want words on me .    I liked the Vivelle because it was just plain , although I do like the shape of the minivelle , just not that darn words .    Help !    Take the words off .

1188	reviews_aug07_parsed/159253_000039.txt	Vestura 28	5	5	1	I ca n't believe I took this horrible medication for seven months !!!    I actually almost started crying reading these reviews because I realized that this pill is what is ruining my life .    I went on birth control to ease the debilitating cramps I had during my period and also to help acne .    Vestura was great for both of those .    But it made me completely crazy .    I used to be a really easygoing , emotionally stable person .    On this pill , I was ridiculously moody , angry , and very depressed .    And I can not even begin to describe the emotional toll this has taken on me , my family and my friends .    Like other reviewers , I started off on Giannvi and was switched to this .    I did n't think it would matter and I honestly did n't even think to look up the reviews .    I just assumed that they would be the same .    At the time , I attributed my craziness to the fact that my life had changed drastically and that I must be having a hard time dealing with it .    I had just graduated college and that I did n't like my job , was living at home , did n't know what to do with my life , etc. .    For some reason , I did n't think that the pill could be making things a lot worse than they normally would have been .    I just stopped taking it so I 'm hoping I 'll start to feel like my old self again .    Some of these reviewers love this pill , but it absolutely was not for me .    If anyone wants to try it , just be warned that if you start having intense mood swings , STOP TAKING IT !    You deserve a better life than that .	1

I had heard about mirena and it sounded great .    5 years and no taking the pill etc etc. .    I did a LOT of reading and found the reviews 50/50 , some people LOVE it others HATED it .    anyway after much research I got it in .    was SOOOO nervous !    having it was in was quick but very painful , it was like labour pains I actually cried out like in labour but it was all over very quickly and from then , no pain or cramping .    I had mild spotting .    my main concern was the possibility of mood swings .    I am already prone to depression and anxiety .    Well the Mirena just turned me into a monster .    I was so snappy at everyone , stressed already with two school kids and a newborn baby , I did not need this .    Gosh if there was a Mirena that had the opposite effect , almost a sedative that would be what we need !    I battled on for 6 months at my lovely Doctor 's advise , she said my body might settle down .    But at the 6 months point I just had to get it out .    I told my husband I was getting it out because of the mood swings and he very carefully said Yes he 'd noticed that .    So out it came - no pain at all .    As for contraception im back on the pill and on the waiting list for my tubes tied because we really are done now .    My anxiety has been worse than ever even since having Mirena out .    Now i 've started on Zoloft -LRB- again -RRB- and feeling like a new person .    I 'm happy and relaxed for the first time in a very long time .    what us women have to go through .    Good luck to anyone getting it , I really wanted to try it and wanted to love it it just was n't for me .    I think you need to be a naturally calm relaxed person to have Mirena .    The ONLY problem for me was the mood swings .	1

After taking it a few days the Tendons in my ankles wrists and shoulder starting twitching , stopped working and caused lots of pain .    I stopped taking it and looked up the side affects and found this medicine rarely affected Tendons .    After a few days the ankles and wrists started working but the one going down from my shoulder to my elbow caused me terrible pain and would not let my arm work correctly .    After my knee surgery , I had physical therapy for the knee and then for my arm .    I can not move my arm out at my side , nor up or back .    After a few months I stopped the P.T. .    Now almost 9 month later I still ca n't move my arm back or up .    It still causes me a lot of pain .    I was told there was nothing that could be done , but just to hope that over time it would heal .    So much for these occurrence 's being rare .

I called the drug manufacturer -LRB- the Stelara toll free number on their website -RRB- when I was concerned when the tongue was all swollen and they kept me on the phone for 20 minutes just to ask me my name and phone number 4 times and then tell me to call my doctor since they could not give me any medical advise .    Why could n't they tell me that All I wanted to know if this was a possible side effect because their website does not list it -LRB- but thankfully drugs.com did list it -RRB- .    At the time I was not overly stressed or worried my tongue was visibly swollen and I could not eat but I was able to breath normally .    I called my doctor and he gave me an epi pen if my throat closed and he was very concerned .    I could not eat all day because of the swollen tongue and spoke funny with a lisp .    Later in the day , my jaw swelled and locked where I could no longer speak , my eyes and lymph nodes swelled as well .    I had intense pain in my ear down to my jaw bone like a ice pick was piercing the ear drum and going down into my jaw .    I was still in denial .    I initially thought I may have had a dormant bacterial infection or viral infection that became active with the immune suppressant , not an allergic reaction .    I went to an emergency clinic .    We got there right at 7:30 .    The doctor kind of laughed at me when I said I thought that I may have an infection .    He told me that I had an allergic reaction .    He gave me a shot of prednisone .    He said if I went to the ER they would give me the shot , a Rx for steroids and an antihistamine for home .    I left there at 8 PM .

My boobs went from B 's to DD 's , which may sound good , but I outgrew all my clothes and experienced severe back pain because of them .    I got headaches all the time and was tired 24/7 .    It took me a very long time to figure out that the pill was the cause of all of these symptoms , but as soon as I stopped taking it , within two weeks I felt completely normal again .    I am also not the only one who experienced this .    My friend was also on Balziva and had the same problems .    It was n't until after she was prescribed antidepressants that she realized that the pill was actually the cause .    I very very very strongly caution against taking Balziva .    I was n't myself for over a year and almost ended up taking my own life because of it .    There are plenty of other options for birth control that work much better , but if you do decide to take it , please just be careful and be very vigilant in watching out for yourself .    No one deserves to feel the way I felt .	1

1286	reviews_aug07_parsed/2671_000135.txt	tramadol	3	2	2	Had severe back pain due to UTI and my doctor prescribed this with Ceclor .    Extreme headache , blurred vision , and nausea after one dose .    Doc thought it was a reaction to Ceclor , but I 've taken that before .    Went off Ceclor 36 hrs .    and took one Tramadol and all symptoms returned .    Obviously , it is Tramadol and not Ceclor or a drug interaction .    Wo n't ever take this again .	1

1289	reviews_aug07_parsed/14494_000813.txt	Topamax	4	2	1	I have vascular migraines but I only get them a couple of times a year .    I really just wanted something to treat them when they happened but my doctor insited on the Topamax .    She said it would help me lose weight , too , which I was struggling with .    I went on the lowest dose 2ce a day and started out ok .    Within a few weeks I found myself feeling moody and depressed for no apparent reason .    I also began to notice problems with my memory , then crazy things like asking my daughter why she did n't put away the green crayon when I knew the crayon I was looking at was blue , calling things by odd names , etc. .    I knew something was wrong but I did n't know what .    It was n't until I researched my medications that I realized the Topamax can cause all these symptoms AND MORE .    I started weening myself off this medication about a week ago and within 3 days I began to feel so much better .    My spirits have lifted and I am getting my brain back .    If you are having these symptoms , it 's probably your meds but do n't quit cold turkey .    That will cause you more problems .    Check with your doc and slowly get off the meds .    Good luck , whatever you do .	1

My doctor -LRB- s -RRB- did not seem to know it is well-known to have a dangerous withdrawel .    I wanted to get off it , and was told to just stop taking it .    Two monthes later , I STILL feel lousy ... symptoms were awful and in the first two weeks , included hallucinations .    Yes , it helped anxiety , and I sure slept better , but it also affected my memory , some perceptions and made me too lethargic .    BE CAREFUL !!!!!!	1
