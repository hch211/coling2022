107301	Given that the average survival rate to this virus is 99%, who will take the vaccine? I sure won‚Äôt. Never took a flu vaccine either.
105412	@FrDaveNix I hear belief in the virus will be added to the Credo.I believe in one coronavirus....and its only begotten vaccine.
201657	The CDC recommends receiving your second COVID-19 vaccine dose three weeks after getting the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and one month after receiving the first Moderna shot. But what happens if you miss your second vaccine appointment? https://t.co/JZ5bRrdNpf
107587	Just in case you‚Äôre wondering. I‚Äôm never having the vaccine. Whatever if threatened or offered. I‚Äôll die before I take it. #COVID19 #covid1984 #vaccine
106375	@EssexPR @sailorrooscout This is very strange though. We know the flu vaccine has only ever been 20-40% effective, yet a brand new coronavirus vaccine is effective not only for current variants, but all the new ones too ü§î
201665	A COVID-19 vaccine update:2,191 #Windsor-Essex residents have received their first dose only, while 9,888 have received two doses. A total of 21,967 doses have been administered to area residents.
106873	@Foward44 @NBSaphierMD It's far fetched to call this a vaccine when it doesn't even give you any immunity to catching the disease unlike actual vaccines. And besides, needing 3 jabs a year too is just ridiculous for a 0.096% mortality rate Coronavirus.
106338	@realDonaldTrump Yes, but are humans too Mr. Trump, The coronavirus is burying all American warriors. They have the technology to go to the moon, but to find a vaccine they are screwed.
107068	@nshealth When is the Covid-19 dashboard going to be updated to reflect vaccine uptake in the 5-11 year old group?

201498	This afternoon @GovBillLee is at the White House for a COVID-19 Vaccine Roundtable. He was just recognized by @realDonaldTrump, and appears to be one of just a handful of governors in the room.
105471	@DebraG_Robins No, but given the process usually takes 10 years plus and we have never produced a vaccine for a coronavirus, I think 2 years is optimistic.
106093	@Sheepdog_89 @yourclueless2 @GovMikeDeWine Are we breaking down into absurdities because me being rational was too hard for you? Colds have medicine. Flu has a vaccine. Coronavirus does not.
106353	@SportsnetPR It is wholly irresponsible for your broadcasters to be saying that people need to make their own decisions about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. They should either encourage everyone to get one when it‚Äôs their turn, or say nothing at all.
106520	@thebradfordfile @MsAvaArmstrong It's a distraxine. No vaccine has ever been approved for a coronavirus (35% of common cold viruses)We don't need one (99.9% nonlethal)The test is whether you have testes or not.
105928	"""I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science -- not politics or cronyism -- has to lead the way."" - Rick Bright, after he was abruptly dismissed from leading the coronavirus vaccine development team because he wasn't aligned with what the @POTUS wanted to do!"
107164	@JanssenUS I spent 5 months last year in the hospital and nursing facility didn't get COVID-19 my doctor told me never get that vaccine i don't like vaccines and never needed one
106343	The hoarders will see how a vaccine doesn't care what's in storage, and those countries where it is unavailable will continue to impact the vaccinated countries until Covid is eradicated. #VaccineApartheid
107657	"Coronaviruses are in every animal so if you've ever had a flu vaccine you were injected with #coronavirus"". Wonder if this is why #fluvaccine is being pushed so enthusiastically this year in the UK...2nd wave 'n all that..."
105921	@HummelTown @MattWalshBlog Do you get hepatitis, polio and measles after you have gotten the vaccine?   Can you still get COVID-19 after the ‚Äúvaccine??   Hello!!
106368	if this is true then 1) the vaccine doesn't work and 2) we were lied to and 3) do we really want to do the NEXT insane thing they try to make us do? I sure as heck don't!
106065	@urkagurka If some already had prior immunity, like my 89 year old mother had, It's lasting and we have nothing to worry aboutOnce encountered and recovered from any of this crop of Coronavirus variants we don't need a vaccine at allIt would not give benefitClear enough now
107026	@courtlynn30 - 2I'm actually think, maybe I go out and get Covid19, so they will FRICKIN' leave me alone when the Mandatory Vaccine comes....
106444	Um, did they need a placebo group because they didn't know the effects of Covid19 with no prophylactic treatment? If so, they are the wrong group to be putting together any vaccine I would be willing to try.
105835	@thehill Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
105421	First refugee in the world to receive a coronavirus vaccine was in Jordan, a country of very limited resources. What an inspiration King Abdullah is to the rest of the world.
201500	Got it today. First jab of Covid19 vaccination in PHC Bhagwati Nagar. Thankyou @narendramodi ji #IndianScientists #RakeHangloo ji and @BJP4India https://t.co/plCYsIoxlm
106726	At this point anyone still telling people not to get the Vaccine or not to take the #coronavirus seriously is just a platinum certified idiot and should be treated as such...the #media should stop treating them like folks with a different opinion.They are simply morons
106079	I love this. As soon as I can find an appt I should be able to get my #CovidVaccine too. It's been a week since I became eligible as a person who is immunosuppressed.
107078	Trending that 30 crore Indian's should get free #COVID19 vaccine  free of cost. Then rest 102 crores? Which system is it? Don't understand. We want vaccine for all Indian's. ‚ù§#VaccineForAll #Covid19India
107159	@angrypengu1n They are eluding to ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt force you to get it, but they can make continued employment conditional on getting the #Covid19 #vaccine‚Äù which I thought was essentially coercion.
105636	@SKyriakidesEU @AstraZeneca Those vaccines do not work on a new virus/strain. How many different/vaccines do you want to be injected?  Two or three or 5? If you do, then think of an pig experiment. Those coronavirus is a new beginning. The rest will be a real racing.
106712	"You can't keep locking us down until there's a vaccine, you imbecile. You have no idea when that will  be, or even if it will ever happen.  Personally, I feel as safe as I ever have, and I owe you nothing. There is no ""we""."
105565	If COVID-19 is so deadly why is it that the BAME who are refusing to take the vaccines and refuse to social distance aren‚Äôt all dropping deadü§î
105856	So, in other words, if you want your life back then vaccinations become mandatory?? @InstituteGC you actually want to take away people rights to do normal things if they don't have the vaccine?? This is insane!! What has this country come too...
105854	Wait a minute, how TF does this work?Is the goal here to help the vaccine recipient or the vaccine creators?  @PsychSavant
107368	Just wait until they start with the worst coronavirus yet when they blame it for everyone dying but it really was the jabbathehut
105597	@QuestionerMoney @Kean1S @allymaclusk @NicolaSturgeon Yes, I know flu has vaccines. Usually between 20% - 60% effective. My point being, even with a vaccine we haven't achieved elimination. There are reasons we've never developed a coronavirus vaccine other than not being able to. I don't doubt there could be a vaccine sometime.
105930	I‚Äôm certain this is going to be the only mishap in these vaccine rollouts. BUT GO GET ONE OR YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE YOUR HOUSE.
106510	The government‚Äôs policy on #COVID19 can be summed up as: ‚ÄúIf you survive, or don‚Äôt get long Covid, well done. If you do, it‚Äôs not our fault. We‚Äôre not going to do anything to mitigate infections; we‚Äôll keep our fingers crossed that the vaccines will save you‚Äô.Or: good luck
105400	@ellencarmichael People, including the government, need to stop waiting for a vaccine. It might never come. We've not been successful with finding good vaccines for coronavirus before. We need a different, realistic plan.
106071	Biden‚Äôs COVID-19 strategy for vaccine distribution and economy recovery is so normal that it is incredibly shocking to my system. That‚Äôs how bad it‚Äôs been. 100 million vaccines in 100 days is shocking to my system. That is all.
107486	Hey Alison would it be a bit late to submit ‚Äú name the first person who received the COVID-19 vaccine ‚Äú to the big  Christmas quiz this Thursday ü§î‚ò∫Ô∏è‚òòÔ∏è
106982	"@DrKND @apropoofnothing Speaking of the phenomenon of ""virus interference"",Dr. Rick Kirschner wrote: ""It's like a one-two punch. Flu vax sets it up, coronavirus delivers the knock out blow."" Or perhaps the coronavirus vaccine sets you up to be vulnerable to the next virus coming down the pike."

107433	@AlanRMacLeod @venanalysis @CancilleriaVE @maduro_en @camilateleSUR 1) to be fair, this is the appropriations bill, in which the coronavirus relief bill was tacked on to..2) BUT... $33 million to meddle in Venezuela‚Äôs business when there are hospitals in our country with 0% ICU capacity in a pandemic + not enough vaccines for everyone. okay!
105645	As someone who has had two jabs, I support the international vaccine programmeBut why is there a misleading sticker on this?
105941	‚ÄúI am afraid ‚Äî and people don‚Äôt like to hear this, but I‚Äôm kind of constantly preaching it ‚Äî we have to prepare ourselves for the idea we do not have a very good vaccine. My guess is the first generation of vaccines may be mediocre.‚Äù
106357	@latimes I've some great examples too. I've a sister who keeps feeding my mom lies, and gets angry when my mom doesn't agree with her. She and her husband told my parents that Covid19 isn't real, that they shouldn't take the vaccine because it's a gov scam.
201580	so my external ovaries ARE supposed to swell from the Covid-19 Vaccine.. correct? Okay, good. Just making sure.
106673	The Vaccines to the Virus that Trump supporters think that is a hoaxThe Vaccines that Trump supporters will implant an microchip into their bodies..Honestly they are so insane that even though they think these things that they will applaud him for what he's said

107441	@Vscarp20 If you‚Äôre not angry about COVID-19 you should get angry. This is not ending soon. This is only the beginning. They estimate this may ebb and flow for YEARS until we develop substantial herd immunity (or a safe vaccine is created). Years. Not weeks. Not months. Years.

107427	@DonnyDonowitz10 @pmarkhemming Currently Covid19 vaccines are not included in the Government's vaccine damage compensation scheme. One has to wonder why.
107356	@bigpictureroxi I don't know if everyone realizes just how remarkable the human accomplishment of the Coronavirus vaccines truly is.
107053	So after vaccine, WHEN you get covid, you could have milder illness. But you‚Äôll still be infectious SO you can still carry and transmit the virus. How‚Äôs that going to control the spread since vaccinated people are allowed to move around etc?
105903	@daosouthwest @simondolan The Pfizer vaccine has upwards of 90% effectiveness.So if you take it you probably won't get Covid-19.If you don't have Covid-19 you can't give it to anyone else.Seems like a good idea to me.
106972	Wow. &amp; good. @DeptVetAffairs is now making COVID19 vaccines mandatory for all heath care personnel. I wonder if/when they will expand the mandate to everyone working in a medical center like they do for the flu shot?
105738	So if the letters in the word Corona add up to 666 doesn't that mean that the Coronavirus is evil and from the Devil? It wouldn't mean the vaccine would be evil. The vaccine would be the opposite.
105480	@roper_93 We don't need a vaccine because he has banished COVID19.  No one else has become sick or died since he banished it. Thank Jeebus for Copeland! And for those who are going to come at me, this is sarcasm.
105650	@MoshPunksNFT hehe, I don't really love the Metal Zone(even though it can sound good when everything is fully cranked). My tweet was about getting the Covid-19 vaccine.
105468	It‚Äôs very scary that approx  50% of the British Population and American Population are crying to get fed their Vaccine üíâ , it‚Äôs taken a year to get this one approved, yet it takes 15 years to get a relatively reliable vaccine.. #Vaccin #hoax #COVID19 #usa #uk #Agenda21 #antiVax

106964	I‚Äôm disappointed but not surprised that there‚Äôs no way to register for the vaccine in the state of Virginia when you‚Äôre in a qualified group. @VDHgov @GovernorVA @MarkWarner
106242	2 weeks ago my family made the incredibly difficult decision to move my father-in-law into a nursing home amidst such strange and challenging times. Today he received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and I am so very thankful.
105575	Wouldn‚Äôt it be funny if China developed the first successfully affective COVID-19 vaccine &amp; tRump would have grovel to get it for the U.S.? They would share of course!
201619	Today I added a layer of protection against this virus with my first COVID-19 vaccine! I‚Äôm keeping myself, my loved ones and the rest of Ontarians safe from COVID-19. Thank you to Dr. Shivani and the entire team for doing an amazing work at Cornell community centre. https://t.co/IGyxAvsCpS
106376	@CDCgov I will not get the vaccine. I will go where I please. I will not submit. I've already had covid-19 and am alive and well! I was neither treated with nor prescribed a z-pak, antibiotics, hydroxychloriqine, or antivirals. My own 51-year old immune system was and will be sufficient.
105326	Why are politicians not participating in this #COVID19 vaccine trial? If they're meant to be looking after us surely they should be the ones who test it out first.
106870	@reubing @SarahJRossiter2 Curious aren't the flu shots tainted with the flu would that mean the Coronavirus shot is also meaning that a vaccine already exists and why important people are getting the virus
106602	So from what I‚Äôve researched SARS, which is a coronavirus, just disappeared without a vaccine.Interesting.
106716	Black and Brown do not take a vaccine please be aware of it be notice My people May God protect and guide us
107499	Brazil has a very contagious variant. It's important that the US sends our best vaccines around the world to protect all peoples. Biden has made a commitment, but none will leave until end of June.
201682	The vaccine-induced reduction in my anxiety was starting to creep me out. Good thing I have good reason to feel so anxious again that my cortisol levels spike.
107523	I couldn‚Äôt articulate it exactly, but this is exactly what my complaint is right now with respect to the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù about boosters. The only questions they need to answer are: 1) is it safe? 2) will it help protect you?Then let people decide for themselves.
105279	as long as pi is everlasting there will be no effective and safe vaccine for coronavirus @LuciferDaily @federalreserve @ThelIluminatii
107525	@MelissaFloBix I actually meant what I said. I am ashamed to be a Finnish person and know that our government doesn‚Äôt supply Covid-19 vaccines to less privileged countries. Currently my country leaders hold the vaccines just in case they will someday give the booster shots.
106284	@sajidjavid can you please chase up the process for getting immune compromised people the third primary vaccine . There is a lot of confusion and no jabbing going on.#vaccine #COVID19 #needabooster
105386	Good news! Biden is doing such a great job handling the coronavirus that we don't need to take the vaccine!
106752	@JainNirmal Yes Mr Nirmal. However this prolly is beacuse #china already has a vaccine for #COVID19 . But yes sooner this will get resolved.
106137	THIS is why I'm really not in a rush to get the vaccine. Or planning on doing anything this summer. Or this Christmas.
106732	@TheEliKlein @CT_Bergstrom If you were trying to shield people from a static danger, say a toxic spill, the fix for the spill would protect everyone.  But Coronavirus is alive and constantly changing, quickly mutating to a form the vaccine doesn't stop.  (cont)
106204	@Ismwatcher_up @Chimmy31 @StarAdvertiser Oh, and if anyone had ever invented a single shot Coronavirus vaccine, they would be billionaires, because they would save farmers TRILLIONS. Doesn't Bill Gates research chicken coronavirus, hmmmm, wonder why, oh to make more BILLIONS!
107191	Just because the mandate has been lifted doesn‚Äôt mean I personally have lifted it for myself. Yes I am vaccinated. I just want to make sure I am safe so I will be wearing my mask until Ohio has higher vaccine numbers. It is my decision üò∑
106564	@BriannaWu I don't agree with this second part. I had an adverse vaccine reaction due to autoimmune disease and the Covid-19 vaccine poses a risk to me, agreed by 3 doctors. That said, they wouldn't sign an exemption. There are a lot of us lost in this system.
201519	I‚Äôve been on edge and frustrated all day. BUT...One glimmer of hope today is that my mom got her second COVID-19 vaccine shot. https://t.co/bFa1xaJr6v
107092	@djthefunkchris @aspidou @ksorbs Yea      BUT.    Over 150 million Flu shots are given out.... So unlike the coronavirus, which we have no vaccines for.... Get it? It's the flu without shots, gone wild.... You're an asshole too.

105804	I see Spotify memes everywhere. I love Neil Young &amp; am a very big fan! I HATE covid19 as it took my healthy mom last yr. I am triple vaxxed. However I don't at all agree w the mandates because they do not stop the spread!! Yes they prevent serious illness.
106295	I DID IT!!! Got my second #COVID19 jab today. I‚Äôm sooo happy, and so relieved! Now, if they would just lift some restrictions soon, I‚Äòm so fed up with  being confined to my home, work and the occasional walk. Fingers crossed for all of you who still need to get vaccinated. üòÑüéâüçæ

106352	It's important to recognize that getting the COVID-19 vaccine is not safe because it was rapidly developed and tested.
106606	@DiscipleColin @wytewzrdz It's the reason we don't yet have a vaccine for HIV as ADE causes worse problems than the virus. It's also plagued every Coronavirus vaccine creation ever known, and yes 'they' knew the potential for ADE to be a prob with these new vaccines but went ahead anyway.
105300	@VMcIntyre13 @AddieCo76160156 @CMOH_Alberta Actually they are *incredibly* safe, even as vaccines go. Anti-vaxxer nonsense is not borne out by the millions of safely administered covid-19 vaccines administered so far.
107604	@kellieb926 @usual_suspect89 @AnaCabrera Is that what they do? Because I'm fairly sure we still have the flu, but there is a vaccine. It's meant to help protect you against dying or getting seriously ill, and to slow down the virus. It's unlikely that CoViD-19 will ever go away completely, but it can be controlled.
105966	Now that we know the risks, it's important those of us who've had the vaccine keep an eye out for any concerning symptoms. Please take note and share it around - the (VERY rare) clotting side effect is treatable if addressed promptly.

107584	@DrZweliMkhize I don't know much about vaccines hey...the polio vaccine seemed to work...so maybe the Covid-19 vaccine will work if developed around more or less the same principles. I don't trust the conspiracy theories about the vaccine. If it's found I'll go for it...that's just me.
106015	@realTuckFrumper @DebbieParkes3 If we can coordinate to fight #COVID19, then we can work together to fix this too. I have no medical training, but I was able to put my IT skills to use last year to help, get researchers what they needed to develop a vaccine. I'm sure I can do the same again.
106128	Was there really a ‚Äúreversal‚Äù? Or did DOH just stop counting in order for the order to be given to open up the economy. Is that when everyone started throwing away their masks? The cases are rising like gang busters now. DU30 wants to hand out free masks. Got vaccines???
106740	So has #tcnt !Pack those churches: Bill Gates is secretly putting microchips in to track you with the vaccine!Just kidding: That's beyond insane. Right Jon?
105368	@washingtonpost This is the BS articles before Biden takes office and then they give him credit for saving the nation from Coronavirus, even though President Trump did all the hard work to get us the vaccines approved and fast-tracked.
201521	I feel like wooden planks are attached to my neck.But I'm done editing from Kisumu, where more like me are finally taking their first Covid-19 jab.I also engaged hospital administration and the Governor on how Western Kenya is averting an infection crisis.All across BBC today. https://t.co/GUgOXUIKrc
105507	If only there were vaccines available. I'm in the high risk group and I'm still waiting for my first shot.We should be getting ready to start protesting, except it's not safe because we haven't had our vaccines yet.

106373	"Not because of ""that"" because of a tyrannical disgusting creature like draconian inhuman consciousness that does not belong on earth. We are not your slaves. Vaccine cards don't belong in the human race nor do humans deserve to be injected against their will."
106951	@ricksokugawa No reputable person has stated the vaccine prevents covid19 100% but that, if one does contract it, the chances of dying from it or being really sick are drastically reduced.
105623	@bodhibrian @SkyNews this early vaccine development project has been a hope stable for the current vaccine being developed. Prior to SARS-CoV-2, there was never a major threat by coronavirus as the one we‚Äôre seeing now. So the urgency to create a vaccine for them was more warranted.

106835	@catturd2 Luv you Mr catturd... but Covid is NOT  real.... it is only vitamin d deficiency and radio/cell tower sickness.  There is no covid19 virus because there are no viruses.  What we perceive as viruses are merely cellular debris. Beware the killer vaccine.
105380	Lol: It's not a waste, vaccine are 95% effective meaning it doesn't work in all circumstances. But it's better than zero % protection of not taking one. Normally those who survived virus will have immune but it's not always the case... It's complicated. #Covid19SA
105568	Okay. I know I have asked for a lot and Japan gov‚Äôt has ignored it all, but please please PLEASE may they stop ignoring the pandemic and approve this vaccine for kids super fast here. PLEASE.
105997	@ThomasEWoods There has never been a vaccine developed for any variant of coronavirus. I believe this will be the same.
107374	@notawokelefty @sailorrooscout @SteveBakerHW The human immune system has literally no reference for novel coronavirus. It only develops one once you either get COVID or you get the vaccine. And natural immunity is temporary, while vaccine immunity will be a lot longer-lasting if not permanent.
107298	Honestly when this Covid19 died down and a vaccine is found, everyone would treat it like a normal everyday influenza. So no need to panic at all.
107212	"Why is Fauci hesitant about a drug that we already have and can work to cure Coronavirus? Fauci is friends with B. Gates.  Is he stalling to approve Hydochloroquine because his ""friend "" is working on a new vaccine? Yet, Gates wants population control...ü§î"

107044	@JohnLukeSam1 I got the #COVID19 vaccine. I also like living, don't want to infect others, and I want to do my part to ensure #COVID19 doesn't spread throughout the country (it still is but I can't stop the deniers)  FYI: The needle didn't hurt. My arm did but only for a day or so.
107569	Lower drugs yes. But not a vaccine that has the Covid-19 virus in it.Read Creature from Jykell Island and Deep State:50 years... These people wants the population thinned out. Taking the vaccine could kill you any way

201520	Soon as I got the jab in my left arm my friend sends me a link to Costco nearby that has Johnson &amp; Johnson in stock so I can do a one and done. Got the J&amp;J in the right arm. No Covid-19 for me and I can continue to work.

106834	Ok everyone it's been 6 months, even my degen gamer lifestyle requires some instances of social interaction once in awhile. Hoping we can get a vaccine/stop spread and get back to normal soon :(
105270	So who did they made it for when they don't even take it? People should never think of taking this poisonous vaccine
107443	@JpStrand27 It means somebody‚Äôs getting paid. 99.985% survival rate, even with the vaccine I can catch it &amp; spread it, so the vaccine literally does not make you safer. All the vaccine does, theoretically, is lower the severity of coronavirus if you get it. Like it or not this is the science
106630	I do not think the average public understands what ICU triage is. This is a very BASIC explanation: When there is not enough resources, staff or space to support you in the ICU, someone will live and someone will die. Please get vaccinated #COVID19AB #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
105777	I'm sorry if this isn't really a good thing to say but I'm not 100% sure if I want the coronavirus vaccine yet. I've honestly been really stressed lately and I don't think it's a good idea put even more pressure onto myself just yet, even though I am eligible for it.
106958	@POTUS Everyone, regardless of immigration status, should get vaccinated when possible. The vaccine is free, and there will be no immigration consequences for seeking COVID-19 testing, treatment, or vaccination. There is hope, but we can only get through the pandemic together.
107537	The issue is the people against vaccines who get covid won‚Äôt take these. It‚Äôs a good try but they will pull the same shit
106555	?????????good for them i guess??It's presented as though we're supposed to get mad about this but I don't really see why we should.North Koreans getting the vaccine is good, actually.
105275	Some people are actually refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine and while explaining their reasons why, they actually think this makes them sound intelligent.
105711	Seriously,  they have been running around without masks! And most are antiscience- so why would they think a vaccine will work?
107183	Why are all the politicians getting the vaccine when they didn‚Äôt do shit for us for most of the pandemic? Give it to the real heroes, healthcare workers, first. Not to mention giving it to the people who downplayed it ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

106883	@Lopez4VA Giving vaccines to everybody is the only way we are going to get past #COVID19.Those who complain about immigrants forget how much our economy depends on the work they do to make America function &amp; survive. They need to be healthy and taken care of just like the rest of U.S.

106117	Is it weird to feel that the basics like having a job and paying the bills don't feel as peak adulting as going to get my COVID-19 vaccine alone...I've always had Mama in every single one of my doctor's appointments. GP, OB, psychiatrist, therapist - you name it, she's there.
105931	So they have bypassed years of tests for the #COVID19Vaccine and to top it all off the virus is mutating. You cannot make a vaccine for something that then changes. The vaccine is then not only unsafe but useless.

106315	Being from Bihar I think the politicisation of vaccine is Nonsense!!- Every Indian life matters- Free Covid vaccine must be given to every unprivileged citizen- If you give us Vote,we give it to you free. If not, then What?- Is Covid vaccine a commodity?#BiharElections2020
106304	@P_McCulloughMD After all there are 30 smthing different coronaviruses and flus that we fight w our developed adaptive immunity- Does covid vaccine replace adaptive response for all coronavirus / seasonal flu  infections we encounter going forward or do we get tht back at some point?
106540	@miramotamv @NPR I don't think you'll see the first one of any coronavirus vaccine until sometime late next year 2021. When they show trials, they give people hope that it will be soon but that's just not the case. They need a lot of testing, and then comes production and dissemination.
105495	@theRCN @HelenDon_RCN @buttynot @gallagher_rose @CNWLNHS Easy to get people to take the Flu jab this winter. Much more difficult to get them to take the Covid-19 vaccine next spring. To promote that poorly tested vaccine would be unethical, immoral and only legal because World Governments will change their laws to accommodate it.
105755	@RunJumpStefReid How would the vaccine be performance enhancing, compared with someone that is COVID-19 free?
107420	Gonna have to put my ass to sleep before they try and give me a vaccine ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm getting that.
106469	@realDonaldTrump you keep saying you're immune from COVID-19 since you have already had it. Why would you then need a vaccine? Either you're lying (you are) or you're stupid (this is true too)
105511	@_Mic_hael_ @JTyler36213241 @MMAFighting The research currently suggests that the antibodies will only last a couple of months. We don‚Äôt develop long term immunity to any coronavirus - this is why the flu vaccine is needed every year and we always gets cold - we don‚Äôt develop immunity.
106853	@MediaSequitur They certainly do not have our best intentions in mind. It is also illogical to make a vaccine against a zoonotic virus, one that T cell mediated memory immunity confers a strong response to across the Coronavirus family. SARS patients from 2003 have immunity to COVID19. This is
106482	I did post this on an anti vaccines thread as well as just posting it generally. Doesn‚Äôt seem like vaccine hesitancy is the big issue even if it is a small sample size
107424	Don't think I would. I was always against the flu vaccines but the corona vaccine would be no different. Don't trust 'em. They are 10x's more dangerous than a virus, in my opinion.
106921	How  do u know if   vaccines are effective?How can any1  predict if a person  can  get  infected or  not  in  the future ?BTW,  Covid RT PCR test kits  are  fraudulent and  they  were  made  way  back  in  2017  when Covid19 wasnt even  discovered

106254	There is a vaccine for the flu, but there are alot strains of flu. One vaccine doesnt cover them all.People still get the flu every year.If a Covid-19 vaccine is created, how long will it be good for? Will there be multiple strains a vaccine doesnt cover?

107224	I don‚Äôt get it. If your immune system fights it off at 98-99% what‚Äôs the need for a vaccine that has a lower rate ? I‚Äôll wait. . . The same way abortions are considered a my choice my body deal I think these vaccines should be too. #mychoicemybody

106155	We should face with the truth, we can't put life on hold before #coronavirus dissappears. We already lost that opportunity. There will be no vaccine till 2021, herd immunity is probably only option, otherwise we'll witness more outbreaks. there is no such thing  #FlattenTheCurve

105213	@ShareefYezdani @AribaShahid How long will it take to build immunity after getting the Covid-19 vaccine?It takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity (against the COVID-19 virus) after vaccination. It is possible a person could be infected with the COVID-19 virus just before or just after vaccination.

106954	there is a flu vaccine yet for 35 years I have had to watch out for the flu. I cant have a flu shot and I would assume that I also wont be able to have a Covid-19 shot. So unless you're going to mandate everyone healthy gets the vaccine it will change 0 for me.
105436	I wonder how this is going to get resolved. It's hard to imagine a scenario where 70 - 85% of Americans voluntarily get the vaccine.In this age of contrarianism, it's hard to imagine any matter where 70 - 85% of Americans would agree on the resolution.
107665	"For anyone tempted to wait or to hold out for the ""best"" vaccine..For all ALL @CDCgov-approved #COVID19 vaccines so far approved:* The risk is tiny* Protection looks to be HUGE* The faster we all get the jab, the faster we'll get to the coverage needed to get back to normal."
106057	America now has the most % people with #COVID19 antibodies. USA Number ONE!Sadly, it means nothing for herd immunity. Studies already showed antibodies don't last very long. You can get sick again. Herd immunity is a myth without an effective vaccine.#TrumpCOVID19 lies.
105729	Why in the hell are we doing COVID vaccine trials on kids!?They are such low risk that this makes zero sense.We know the risk is exceedingly low if kids get COVID and the risk is unknown with the vaccine so we think it makes sense to give them the vaccine!?
105692	Immunocompromised immune system may not survive after vaccine because it contains mimic of corona virus, they use corona virus DNA to make mRNA Covid19 vaccine to trigger your immune system to produce antibodies against this virus.

105515	@lsanger I dont need the COVID19 vaccine because I had a vasectomy almost 20yrs ago. And since I want healthy grandchildren, my children don't need the vaccine either!
107364	This is not good #COVID19 news on so many levels.That a doc died is a terrible loss in the ranks of lifesaversThat it's unknown how he got #COVID so as to know the vaccine efficacyThat we don't know if he had a placebo or notHe didn't just get sickHe diedHe was only 28

106860	So people should rather sit next to someone with a vaccine card who can still spread the virus, instead of sitting next to someone who has a negative test result and can‚Äôt spread the virus because they don‚Äôt have it? What a strange world we live in.
105684	@Cyndula @TheJordanRachel Yes it is when the vaccinated are getting Covid-19 again. There are probably multiple strains already around. Hence the new variant. Passing through that many people. This is why we have a new flu shot every year. The vaccines can control it. But we shouldn't have to get it
106515	??? The vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent you from getting covid. I hope he doesn‚Äôt think it does. I hope no one thinks that.
107018	@WeWanttoLive5 @AlexBerenson In theory that's great if you have a vaccine or 90-95% have had it and are immune not enough is know about coronavirus to say anybody is immune people are getting twice
105808	@TheHugoMorales The WHO said a couple days ago that it will likely be around forever. This vaccine will end up being another flu shot. Idk why people are waiting for a vaccine to a coronavirus anyway.

106141	@alina_garner @gitoma1 @sajidjavid @IndependentSage @CMO_England I dont see why it wouldn't become endemic, though if it drifts enough like the flu virus (unlikely), it may require yearly vaccine as it may effect those at higher risk endemic perhaps, but how long? Years, decades, no one knows I dont think coronavirus studies/cont..
105302	@WufpakRed @AndyCasarolle @RyanGirdusky He‚Äôs taking about the coronavirus vaccine mandate !! my goodness how dense can you be?

A #PANDEMIC is here so why would people not following rules of social distancing and wear PPE‚Äôs &amp; still socialize/party/march for justice. Be #WISE Life over party- #vaccine soon!
106530	Yeap, They do not care, and just allowing Covid-19 to spread.‚ò†Ô∏èüò≠üá∫üá∏üíô President keeps pumping a miracle vaccine will be here, any moment( BS)!  It does make you wonder, ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù?
106649	Great to see the bleeding heart NHS-loving celebs on #JeremyVine advocating queue jumping for the Coronavirus vaccine if you've got the cash.
107093	You go out on a thrive and all your brasse recieved their Covid-19 vaccines, you chose not to. Fast forward, everyone catches covid yet they don‚Äôt get seriously ill. You on other hand are hooked up to a ventilator coz you chose to ignore the science.

Never have we had such a tyranny. Where will the evidence be that it will work? We have the flu vaccine but still have flu. The common cold, a coronavirus, can't pretend to a vaccine. Will there be one for C19 because it was man-made in the first place?
106035	The COVID-19 vaccine should tested on @OfficialPDPNig members first . If they survive the vaccine is safe , if they don't NIGERIA  is safe.  Thank you all .
105583	This is fundamentally the outcome of the commentariat deciding to disparage foreign vaccine programmes when it looked as if they may beat Britain too it. Once you begin undermining reality the genie can‚Äôt be put back in the box
107147	@rogertansey As harsh as this might sound.. triage is needed. If the older people come in with covid19 that chose not to take the vaccine don't treat them. Treat only the children that were not taken care of. They are the future. Can't fix stupid. They get to own it. They chose it.
107131	@KatalinTischha1 @alfgrowler @MorphingReality @richard_xxxx @ClarkeMicah We have been studying the aids virus for 30 years. We still cannot formulate a vaccine. This coronavirus has been around 6 months. We are in the foothills of discovery on the long term effects. If sustained exposure causes serious long term damage we will not know for months/yrs.
107492	@CNBCnow I'm curious as to if this drug works like a flu vaccine where if someone who has the coronavirus take this drug not only gets better, but also developed antibodies to the disease
106544	they should have mandated vaccines from day 1, in NY we‚Äôre mandated to be vaccinated in order to attend school, why can‚Äôt they just add the covid-19 vaccine to that list, the honor system was never going to work lmfao

106261	Please be aware of this.The #COVID19 #vaccine is not like any other vaccine you have ever had.It is not something that can be called a vaccine if you check the contents.Please don't get hurt anymore.Do your own research.
106960	@BorisJohnson @bbcburnsy @looknorthBBC @peter_levy you say all the top 4 priority groups have all had the first covid Jab. This is not correct. I and my sister are in priority 4 and not even had a letter, text, or phone call to get one. #COVID19 #vaccine #VaccinePassports
107055	The only way Trump makes these coronavirus press conferences a positive is if he blows up Fauci and Birx for the frauds that they are. Bring in 100 doctors and have a true discussion about the virus. And forget about your vaccine. Otherwise, we‚Äôre back to where we started.
201598	@gillianlant @9NewsMelb Awesome seeing the first person to get their 3rd jab. Good on Roman &amp; I wish one of the members of VIctorian government witness that, like Scott Morrison did with the first ever Covid19 vaccine recipient.
105834	@PlatinumJab Sir, u said bharat and china will work together in the future. Is the coronavirus outbreak a step towards it?
106665	@LotusOak2 What are your thoughts on the Covid19 vaccine altering our DNA? Do you have any information on this please? Obviously when you google this every article claims this to be false but I still have my doubts
105444	@aslavitt46 @ASlavitt Dr. Slavitt, Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. You don‚Äôt know the science on this I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
107114	This is my first tweet about China. peoples are getting worst like Chinese people we humans have some rules for eating habits this creatures(Chinese people) will not leave any thing like dogs, batsetc., my conclusion is do something to China or please discover vaccine for covid19
201801	"This is concerning. ""The congressman had received a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and had tested negative for Covid-19 before attending President Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, Tarpey said. But she did not specify when Lynch received each dose of the vaccine."""

106818	@Henrik_Palmgren I wonder if Ms Wu has heard of antibody dependent enhancement, the downfall of previous coronavirus vaccine attempts (SARS/MERS)? Having a more severe immune reaction on 2nd exposure isn‚Äôt necessarily the herald of a successful vaccine.

106104	The irony that a vaccine trial can be completed more quickly in the United States, because the pandemic is out of control in this country.  Scientists can get vaccine testing data rapidly.
107594	$GRTS We can‚Äôt keep getting booster shots every few months when a new variant appears. Outdated thinking and is akin to pulling up to a gas pump in a Tesla. Gritstone solves this.

107539	h*******t. We‚Äôve got vaccinated nursing home residents who are turning up positive for coronavirus. Vaccines and masks do not work. I repeat they are not effective.
107248	@AudreyManaster2 This is how the new vaccine will be produced, I think with changes in the coronavirus DNA genomes and why in some trials now they've been halted due to test human subjects having serious reactions. Why a rushed vaccine could have devastating effects. My assumption from readings.
106604	@ashtrei2 @GatesAnti So you wanna Die? If you want to die you don't need to make other people think #antivax is good. Just get tested on Covid-19 and get your Vaccine.It's that simple!

106245	@MattHancock @Peston @lfspinney @BBCJustinR why is no one talking about the inhaled interferon #SNG001 as the solution for #COVID19 this winter. We need effective treatments and a small British biotech has the answer. We need to protect ourselves THIS WINTER &amp; a vaccine isn't going to do that
105654	Not sure when/if I am getting my flu jab this year. Usually eligible due to asthma. Nothing on my GP website and NHS Scot only taking bookings for health care workers (using same portal as COVID-19 vaccinations). It‚Äôs important I get it so I can look after my baby properly.
106708	@AndrewMarr9 why is it taking so long to get the Novavax Covid19 vaccine approved, this excellent vaccine could ensure ample vaccines are available. The government has pre-ordered this vaccine, what‚Äôs the hold up? Ps I‚Äôm on the Novavax trial!
106516	They say that as if we aren‚Äôt used as pawns to reel our people in. 3-4 of their COVID-19 vaccine test subjects have already been diagnosed with Bell‚Äôs Palsy. It‚Äôs a no for me. Idc if every black person in the entire world took this vaccine, I would be the only one who didn‚Äôt.
105644	If it's true then it will be great victory for humanity against Coronavirus #vaccine #coronavirus #CoronaUpdates
107161	Okay, someone educate me now because what I just typed out makes sense to me, so I'm trying to figure out if the amount of push to get the vaccine has legitimate backing, or if it's going to be a short-term fix to COVID19 but the cause of something else that cripples us.
107286	gonna be disappointed if the coronavirus vaccine doesn't give me the huge butt and tits that the boomers say it does
106146	@JoeBiden all this stuff your doing isn‚Äôt getting the Coronavirus vaccines IN AMERICANS ARMS - who‚Äôs running this operation?
106846	@HeidiForLiberty @realDonaldTrump After only 45 years, the flu vaccine is administered annually. Many catch the flu anyway. So given both are Coronavirus‚Äô, why do we believe a vaccine will return us to normal. Listen to fauci, he is already questionin how many does are needed and the durability of the immunity.

105450	Vaccines seem to be failing pretty bad. Long as the virus is around it will mutate. Need therapeutics for a return to normal @ImmunoPrecise $ipa
105923	Covid-19 vaccine has the ability to change your DNA. Be careful don't take it. Besides covid-19 has very low mortality rate. You can survive without any medication.
106721	Whoop there it is. #TheWhitehouse will determine the efficacy of the #coronavirus Vaccine according to Brian Morgantsen Deputy Whitehouse Press Secretary. If it's not @FDA fuhgetaboutit, no American is taking this Vaccine.
105704	@tedcruz Same way it makes sense that COVID-19 denialists like Marco Rubio get a vaccine first.Gitmo has guards.  They would not want COVID-19 to spread as it has in other prisons.
107532	This could be like letting a stranger drive you across the country, if that stranger got a driver's license 40 years ago but never drove a car after passing the exam.It's because people won't get vaxxed and take precautions during a global pandemic. Incredible.
201575	"It baffles me every time I hear my peers say ""I don't know what's in the vaccine so I'm not taking it"" My reply-- We've taken well over 7 vaccines since birth without knowing the composition, Covid-19 vaccine isn't any different. Get vaccinated joor!!"
107337	This is why we always remind that Covid-19 is not a joke. For those who loves to go out and dating here and there please wake up. Vaccines or not you will still have the chance to be infected
201639	Got my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine this week, some friends did some pretty awesome things, excited about #MenInKilts, &amp; bought myself some chocolate covered üçì &amp; pasta to treat myself today. Time to spread some love &amp; save some lives by donating plasma. #ValentinesDay ‚ù§
105372	@USATODAY Viruses mutate.  That is why they have to tweak the flu vaccine every year.  That is why there is no vaccine for the common cold.  The #coronavirus is a cousin to these.  The Pfizer CEO may know this, that is why he sold Pfizer stock when their vaccine was announced.
106977	THAT is terrific since a vaccine will be useless against what is tantamount to a common cold. The Flu shot is just as useless (it made my husband sick for 6 months).  Save our tax dollars.!.!
106709	#COVID19 #BillGates// I hope you struggle until you're HOMELESS because you deserve it for being so damn DUMB. Even comedian George Carlin would be able to see through this shit but you all probably wouldn't believe him either. All of you all who will take the vaccine, when it
105722	@NTVNewsNL @KellyAnneNTV Yeah I think I will sit this one out for while... You know.. to see what happens to the people who do take a rushed vaccine for a coronavirus where they cut safety and testing measures at every corner...
107090	This is such a stretch but tomorrow, we're gonna see a landslide in covid19 cases.... #Chromatica is the vaccine!!!!!!
106490	And what's abt gujarat ?? They are ruling since 25 years still no announcement of free vaccine. Inspite other states has already announced free vaccine like UP, MP, Jharkhand etc etc. @BJP4Gujarat @BJP4India @CMOGuj @vijayrupanibjp

107076	@johnb3112 @PaulBuc31614268 @Pfizer_UK Err, you can get flu after being vaccinated. So no, covid isn't the only one. You need a course on epidemiology as you obviously don't understand. Or even to read up on the basics of vaccines for coronavirus'. üòÇüòÇ
106832	This is very important.  It looks like we should be deploying vaccines around the world rather than boosting, for many good reasons
106263	Free testing for the Coronavirus. At my job. Hell no I will never trust a system That find it OK to shoot me but then want to save me with a vaccine. Something is not right here if you can‚Äôt protect me legally through bullets and guns are you going to save me with a vaccine
106475	My covid-19 vaccine is booked. I‚Äôve been eligible since March, but I‚Äôve had some trouble getting an appointment. I don‚Äôt have the words for the gratitude I feel today. Hang in there everyone, better times are coming. üíõ
106702	When it comes to taking that vaccine, I'm in no rush to get it. I have to give it time.The vaccine is not a cure to covid19. There are medication out there which can cure the covid and they are been overlooked. Why is it so?There is something fishy about this vaccine.
106239	So basically we don't have vaccine for virus which is killed by hand sanitizer....Ironic isn't it üòÇüòÇ,@COVIDNewsByMIB #COVID__19 #coronavirus
107306	This is a two America‚Äôs moment. I would never do any of the things in this video but I‚Äôll take the vaccine tho
106318	Is it too late to join the vaccine race? How far are we into this bubble. Is there still money to be made or is it nearly done? Asking for a friend...
106267	We had the same evaluation in Canada a month or so ago. Canada, I believe, now has 5 vaccines approved, all with 100% efficacy against hospitalization, meaning it reduces the severity of the infection if you do get infected. In 79%, it prevents symptoms completely. Great news.
105374	@CDCgov @FatEmperor I don‚Äôt remember getting this advice before I had the flu vaccine. Is it perhaps because the COVID-19 vaccines have been hurried through a typical approval process and they don‚Äôt have enough data yet on how effective they truly are.
106759	If some of the countries are out hacking into other countries data to steal a covid19 vaccine, that would mean the stealer does not have a vaccine and if they claim they do, it mustn't work
106198	Notice they specify the words ‚Äòfully vaxed‚Äô so when they are talking about ‚Äòunvaxed‚Äô they are also referring to those who may have only had one shot or failed to get a booster. Hence ‚Äòunvaxed‚Äô is a large pool...
201761	My body my choice &amp;  my choice is no.  It's an unproven, untested vaccine no matter who made it and I'll be goddamned if it's going into my body. You want it go ahead, your body your choice.
106886	Just don‚Äôt take one.  Why take a vaccine for a virus that has a .03% death rate and that will only make Bill Gates richer.  THINK PEEPS!
107350	@cosmicdust911 @CatherineLugg @ASlavitt The reason we don‚Äôt have a vaccine for colds is because there are so many strains of cold viruses. We do have vaccines against certain coronaviruses already. This is one strain of coronavirus which makes a single vaccine much easier.
107425	I took my headache vaccine this morning.Yesterday I had some allergy vaccine.My wife took her baby vaccine. We‚Äôre destroying language. This isn‚Äôt a vaccine. #COVID19 #vaccine #Biden @ComicDaveSmith @michaelmalice

105334	So, just to get this straight:a) international cooperation;b) immigrants, and not just one gender;c) working in a country with free univ tuition= the first COVID vaccine to save lives. #cdnpse
106431	This article is poorly written. There was absolutely no reason to say that they‚Äôre the poorest nation (as if that‚Äôs their fault???) and if you‚Äôre writing an article on how there‚Äôs no vaccines then focus on that. Why are you mentioning the other struggles of the country?
201756	I talked to my parents on the phone today. My mom was worried that if there will be a vaccine for COVID-19 then I should not get it because I‚Äôll die or get a ‚Äúmicro chip‚Äù under my skin. Also, my mom refuses to wear a mask because it damages the respiratory system.
107196	"@Louise86958858 @KorbelRenoKia @stacyhrae Covid vaccine started being developed after the SARS epidemic (also a firm of Coronavirus) . That's why it seemed ""fast"". They had all the groundwork done over the last 15 years."

105505	@tigheklory @stgenerations There are thousands of flu strains, they try to predict a few of out that and end up with 40% or higher success. Not too bad, but CoVid19 is a mutation of the SARS-CoV virus. Very different from the flu virus. The work on this vaccine started with work on SARS-Cov.
107467	@FionaMattatall I actually believe this faith in vaccines is a bit dangerous. Yes, they are important and yes, they will help us get back to some sort of normal life, but they won't eradicate Covid-19 completely and we'll still need to be careful.

106514	Yeah, and that's why they (i.e. not US, but THEM) are having such a hard time replicating an effective vaccine? --These hominid scientists must be socially incentivized to make highly illogical statements, or are otherwise not properly thinking through the planetwide phenomena.

106689	üëâThis quick survey is for people working in care homes or social care.Researchers want to know the number of staff getting their flu jabs, which is already thought to be low.Knowing this (and why) could help more staff get their vaccines and reduce pressure from #COVID19.

106041	@mickschimp @GovPritzker Vaccines are particularly helpful for herd immunity but they take years to develop. Because COVID-19 is so new there is no herd immunity, because there is no immunity. Being exposed to the virus can be deadly so therefore it is best not to risk it. Period.

106259	@RealCandaceO I‚Äôm confused. If the right person/group created a vaccine, you wouldn‚Äôt take it if Covid-19 kept coming back? Do you get your flu shot? Havent you been critical of anti-vaxers before this? I‚Äôm generally curious no disrespect
201754	"Saying ""God will blow in my lungs again"" is just arrogant. A reasonable person of faith would thank the Almighty for the assist, then get the vaccine. #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS"
106725	Yes Selena Gomez is getting the covid-19 vaccine because she saw Britney Spears got it I'm going to keep an eye on her and make sure she is okay it won't even matter if she die because she will be still alive in my fantasies until I die
105558	this is extremely sad but people forget that vaccines protect you only about 95% from getting covid. you can still get covid. but it does give u 100% protection from it being deadly. doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt have painful symptoms. just to put it all in perspective.
105988	Can I get my follow-up vaccine in 8 months (or however long it‚Äôs gonna be) here plsI also pretended to swim on the floor underneath this while also dealing with a disgustingly swollen ankle/leg covered in rashes (possibly) caused by Lyme Disease in college #Nevur4get
105493	A shockingly high statistic, please RT, blood cancer patients need to know how effective the COVID vaccine is for them
107335	@hdevreij But hwo do they beat they the virus if not with particular antibodies ? @who .. the question is therefore  also vice versa .. People with no flu vaccine beat the flu too #COVID19  #coronavirus
107378	"@prlhrbrscks @BadLegalTakes Knowing this con, probably ""how I invented COVID-19 vaccines and why you shouldn't listen to all the other people claiming they did, and please don't pay attention to my vaccine actually being a partially eaten red crayon"""
106973	@KhamisuArt So let me explain it like this- with vaccines being preventatives, not cures. In other words, the vaccine will protect a person who receives it by lowering their chances of getting COVID-19 if they encounter the coronavirus.
107307	Fear not. Prolly we aint gonna have a choice about whether we get the coronavirus vaccine or not-because we are gonna hafta have an official government vaccine certificate on our phones to enter buildings, fly, shop, drive, have a bank account, buy anything, go out, have a job.
107589	If you think about it if your body can‚Äôt make antibodies against Covid-19 once you‚Äôve had it like they say then how is the vaccine 90% effective ? Cos don‚Äôt vaccines work by ur body making antibodies to a weakened version of the virus for when you get it properly ü§î
105982	That coronavirus vaccine is definitely going to be a requirement for school districts and colleges/universities. I dont know why this is even a debate when they ALREADY mandate that students have certain shots/vaccines at enrollment.
105448	Still don‚Äôt understand why I need a vaccine that has lower efficacy than my own immune system. 99% vs. 94%. Vaccine does not prevent transmission, so what is the purpose?
105791	if the COVID-19 vaccine is available to you why wouldn‚Äôt you get it? please explain your reasoning i am really trying to understand
105211	should I get da coronavirus vaccine and spend my weekend feeling like pure shit or should I wait and possibly get the coof
107602	üá®üá¶I wonder if a extra faster booster shot is needed after shot 2? All Governments seem to lag behind the science in my opinion. But, there is a problem with having enough for poor countries to even get shot 1. So, this is not good news. üëá
107123	Is china actually capitalist? Well, either way, they don't lock vaccines for massive, civilization paralyzing pandemics, behind patients.
201527	After spending all week eagerly anticipating my 2nd COVID-19 jab this morning, I managed to get absorbed in something I was doing and completely miss my appointment.Thank you to Darwin Practice for following with a phone call too remind me and being flexible with the time.
106234	@elzi0n engineering the body to produce coronavirus spike proteins like a Frankenstein mutation. To magically coerce anti-bodies when anti-bodies provided no such protection before, and will only reduce symptoms. based on faulty PCR. Is not a vaccine. It's fraud.
106345	Because most of y'all won't get the vaccine, #COVID19 is going to hang around like herpes. India WISH they had as much vaccine and open appointments as us.Listen, the vaccine isn't killing folks. #Covid_19 STILL is.
106214	need i remind you that coronavirus HAS been around and they‚Äôve been developing a vaccine for years now. this is just a different strand, so no they didn‚Äôt pull a vaccine out of thin air in 6 months.
107570	I don‚Äôt understand either. It is a mystery. I am fully vaccinated with booster and so are my three young kids. I was so relieved when they were eligible to get the vaccine. Why wouldn‚Äôt I do something to help mitigate the risk of them getting sick? That‚Äôs how I see it‚Ä¶ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
107474	@Warnzwifey @SimonYstwyth @Louiseg37789012 @simondolan A successful vaccine is perhaps 70% effective, a poor one 30%.We‚Äôve been trying for 40 years for a coronavirus vaccine &amp; failed, there is not one. How effective do you supposed the rushed, untested &amp; very expensive mandated one will be??If you think 50% you‚Äôre deluded.
107562	In 24 hours I will receive my first COVID19 vaccine and I am overwhelmingly relieved.Being immunocompromised and living through a pandemic has been a special kind of bad, but hopefully this is the beginning of the endüôåüèº
105897	It's crazy how sm people so willing to criticize people for not putting a vaccine in their body when the vaccine is still in emergency usage, is pushed by the Gov w a pedophile as the spokes person (bill gates) and it doesnt even fuckin work effectively? People still die
106676	@marco001100 @RedDogT3 LOL. Do you know from where the vaccinated people are getting COVID? Ding Ding Ding, they are getting it from unvaccinated people. If all unvaccinated get the vaccine, vaccinated won't get an infection because there is no unvaccinated to spread COVID19 to the vaccinated
106551	Two ryerson students have coronavirus looooool u will not catch me leaving my house until they have a vaccine
106074	#USArmy know truth about covid19 vaccine,They are smart one and refuse ,We Indian are üêë get in line to take those genetically modified virus in there healthy body.

106305	@Arethusa99 @CT_Bergstrom @loisbeckett @CNBC @WHO I'm afraid the genie that isn't going to go back in the bottle, after the protests, is the #COVID19 restrictions. There's not even any point in advocating restrictions now.  It will just invite resistance to doing things like wearing masks and taking vaccines.
105563	@rabid_rabitt @nathandfletcher @DPJHodges And when will they be ready because we were told they would be ready to roll out by October and that's tomorrow. No coronavirus vaccine currently exists, only 1 disease has ever been eradicated by vaccine and that took 184 years to achieve. There is no magic bullet coming.
107249	@guardian What happened to FLATTENING THE CURVE? You can‚Äôt eradicate a virus. Furthermore there has never been a vaccine for ANY coronavirus - Aka Flu, SARS, Mers-COV. I smell propaganda.
106100	@jsolomonReports @justonepatriot Fauci has a financial stake in a vaccine for coronavirus.  If a cheap alternative can knock this out Fauci would not only lose financially but he would lose his liberal rock star status and miss out on the opportunity to go on tv and and give his fase predictions.

106296	@kmelo32 How long does wearing a mask last? Coronavirus is one of the most common viruses there is. This virus will mutate at around nine month intervals drastically. Vaccines will be as useful as vaccines for the flu just a best guess. We all need to start thinking for ourselves
107399	@TosinAshafa It's really scary tbh but then all we can do is wait till a vaccine is out or we might possibly not have one, treatment would be the only curable option for Covid-19 in the long run
106314	@jasonsphipps I think they will be lifted when our hospitalizations are very low from COVID-19 (right now on par with influenza but understandably US probably wants even lower severe disease which can be accomplished with vaccines).
106653	So, #COVID19 is solved, NoKo response settled, economy good, ISIS gone, middle East Peace, no kids in cages, vaccine has been successful!If none of that is true,WHY THE FUCK IS THE IMPOSTER @POTUS RAGE TWEETING ABOUT STUPID SHIT, HIMSELF.This #fuckingmoron will not shut up.
107400	"@ABC Why bother waiting when the ""vaccine"" does NOT stop #COVID19 ?And by not testing the vaccinated our government is just allowing a huge potentially contaminated population to just run free...while blaming the minority of the population."
106112	@awearbo @honeybe02577966 @raissawriter What i meant is that the Opposition should not become like Persida Acosta in her vaccine scare-mongering.  Do not politicize the Covid19 vaccine
107398	Running implicitly thru the nytimes piece on the Oxford covid-19 vaccine work is the fact capital refuses to fund research or vaccine development to save millions of lives unless it sees profit in it. This fact is acknowledged in a buried paragraph but critical for understanding
106522	@rumpolekid Don't worry that's the white cells fighting the flu germ. If you want to have it worse take the coronavirus vaccine.

The vaccine, coincidentally approved JUST BEFORE the outbreak of covid19, would theoretically work for SARS-COV2 because their RNA are not so much different.  It‚Äôs not like the flu.
105357	Essentially the #COVID19 vaccine is socialized medicine that republican politicians are clawing over their continuants to get first after saying that the virus was only the flu with a low death rate. #GOP #coronavirus #COVID19Vaccine #SundayMorning #SundayThoughts
105649	Am sure in the covid-19 researchers‚Äô labs they are talking about finding someone that is immune to the virus in order to make the vaccine and it‚Äôs like some African guy in like central Africa
107015	Without adequate vaccine cover when SOPs are relaxed there will be an another wave, ‚ÄúV‚Äù shaped recovery is for countries that ensure adequate vaccine coverage. For countries like us it is ‚ÄúW‚Äù a shaped recovery.
107408	The bad news: The vaccine didn't work.The good news: You'll be able to fight the virus better next time if you aren't dead because the vaccine didn't work.
107651	When GOP MAGA chosen god and so-called president said that the Coronavirus was a hoax; not so serious, why are they pushing their vaccine? Profits anyone?
106154	We've never had successful FLU vaccine, nor for AIDS, so how in a few short months are we going to get anything safe for a cartoon virus?

106116	London doesn't know how many residents it has. People move in and out and don't always bother to update GPs. Probably accounts for London's comparatively low vaccine stats and infection stats. So they are sending out letters to -people who aren't here.
201543	Very grateful because @lfmexi and I have just received our first dose of covid-19 vaccine #AstraZeneca üôèReminder: (almost) complete protection comes after the second dose.#GetVaccinated

107277	I don't see this playing out well for the @NFL and the @NFLPA They practically forced their players to get vaccinated so they could play this season and here we are with guys testing positive left and right. Wonder how players will feel about getting jabbed and still can't play
106489	We‚Äôre in 58th place in the world, Gerry, behind Borat‚Äôs Kazakhstan, for percentage fully vaccinated. That‚Äôs how I am measuring success. My mother being in the hospital for a month with Covid, but fortunately not dying, is a success but it had nothing to do with securing vaccines
105533	@KyleThinksTwice @BrennanGeis @Dean_Winnipeg @PierrePoilievre They work far better than no vaccine. Another 50 people died in Ontario today from #COVID19 and ICU admissions are up above 600. This is because most do not have a booster. If you want to get sick great, but don‚Äôt try to use your rights as a way to take my rights away.
105965	@DrTomFrieden How about Inate or crossimmunity. Like how cowpox cured smallpox and vaccinia is used in the smallpox vaccine. Three different strains of pox virus. So other coronavirus exposure could provide cross immunity to the covid one.
105880	Would be interesting to know what the usual vote is for vaccines. I think it is important to know what the concerns were for the no/abstains
201683	Now really debating to really call my dentist office sometimes this week before my second COVID-19 vaccine next week since my toothache is not getting any better and it is starting to really bother me. Now I am not going to be surprised if I do have a cavity and my sealants worn.

105220	@borderman67 @FurburgerMayor Agreed but it's not a true vaccine.BTW I'm not an #antivaxxer I've had my first one and I've had Covid19.
106764	For the Record I'm having my Jab asap because i'm in Group 6. My folks were in Group 4. Do I think you should 'have to have' #COVID19 jab if you're 25, Female, No comorbidity then God no! Some scientists r against healthy getting vaccinated. Can we have debate about it at least?
106342	@Polkameister I could see saying until COVID-19 has a vaccine loosening this as yes some will abuse it but we want to ensure anyone sick isn't coming to work to avoid spread, but making this permanent is nuts.  I think 5 sick days and anything beyond requires a doctor's note.
106743	@RichieRTR @conorsen Also, the reason why the flu vaccine is 46% effective is not really relevant here. Flu vx is partially a guesswork game about which new mutations will be prevalent in the coming year. That is not the case with covid-19 as it has very little evolutionary pressure.
106528	@ABC Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.

105486	I don't understand why 6 out of 7 million would cause a pause. It's such a low %. Won't things like this lead to skepticism in a vaccine?
106956	The vaccine is free to all those in eligible groups. The NHS would never ask anyone for their bank details. They will be in touch when it is your turn to be vaccinated.
107582	How can they be recommending anything when there‚Äôs issues with these vaccines, i‚Äôm not anti-VAX I‚Äôm just anti-experimental VAX.  Get it right and then will think about taking it
106693	"Neil's right - it's about money. What he's forgetting is people NEED money to live and survive. Unless he's footing the bill to put millions out of work AGAIN. The ""lockdown dance"" isn't a good quality of life. We've found the way (vaccines) to do it safely. Don't stop it again"
107346	An amazing program in my network that is working to support training and career pathways for Black and Latin medical students toward HIV vaccine research!
105949	As a senior citizen I am so frustrated with FL in trying to get a covid-19 vaccine. I don't have a cell phone can't afford it-have a land line. Have a notebook, signed &amp; called my vaccine . com to get a place in line. No call back. I go on Publix site multiple times...
106182	m-m-m maybe just m-m-maybe if only they make access to vaccines equal for all, including third world countries... oh wait... they d-d-d don't...?
106240	@ChildrensHD @silvano_trotta Let us not forget that if the bidding for a hypothetical vaccine is so excessive, there will be no holds barred. We are witness to the worst human vileness. They will do everything to enlist the people in their project. They are more dangerous than Covid19.
107285	Why is everyone excited about a #covid19 vaccine? Don't you realize that in the US, the very rich will get it, the very poor will get it thru Medicaid, but if you fall in between these, it will be unavailable or so costly nobody can afford it? They're estimating $2000/shot
105940	@NYCGRIFF Get a grip!!! Lockdowns and vaccine mandates don't work! Vaccinated still getting Covid19 and omicron etc. They don't want to be vaccinated then they take the chance they may die. I am vaccinated and still got Covid19 so don't blame everything on Desantis!
105937	Which ever company researchers discovers the first successful Coronavirus vaccine deserves thr ‚ÄúNobel peace price,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe breakthrough prize‚Äù or any Science research award.
107067	@Jaz_Patriot @nathanmhansen #Boilingthefrog Powerful.It's just a mask.It's just communion or singing. You can still meet.It's just until we get a vaccine.It's just a few side effects.It's just a bracelet.It's just to let people know you're safe to be around.It's just for the coronavirus vaccine...
106032	@nic_davis4 @UKCovid19Stats This isn‚Äôt about any coronavirus with .1% mortality. Tories don‚Äôt spend money and world governments never agree. It isn‚Äôt any great reset either.Something is off if they are prepared to put out vaccines this fast using tech they‚Äôve been hiding for a decade or more ü§îü§îü§î
105312	If hard core #GOP #GQP Crazies don‚Äôt like #COVID19 vaccine mandates, stop ALL vaccines. Just try some dirt or ivermectin, and other ‚Äúhome remedies‚Äù to stop polio, mumps, and other diseases. Is science REAL OR NOT? Just STAY OUT of hospitals when you get sick or are dying please!
106396	Please before testing the new vaccine in Africa, tell us the relationship between HIV and polio vaccine, and why vaccines have always to be forced to Africans while we know they are a test. This time round Africa does not need Covid 19 vaccine, malaria has been killing more.....
107551	@ccpastormike @GovMikeDeWine @LtGovHusted @OHdeptofhealth @DrAmyActon @realDonaldTrump And when they realize there will be no vaccine, they need to give up on that idea. There's never been a vaccine for any coronavirus.
107187	In Context, the Nurses May Not Be Taking a Vaccine Because They are Young with No Complicating Medical Issues &amp; Not High Risk. Some May have Already Had Covid. To All of the Non-Vaccinaters or Those that Just Don't Want to Take it, Thanks Because There is More for the Rest of Us.
106889	@BrittPettibone You may be right, however the election won't really matter if a coronavirus vaccine is forced on people before then.
105991	Can we all just agree that Donnie has gotten the COVID-19 vaccine long ago? There is no way in hell ppl that have been in contact with him every day are dropping like flies and he is still standing. #NotAConspiracyTheory
106572	@KMPHFOX26 Well we'll see about this I'm holding my breath we have not had any one in my immediate family catch the delta or the original covid-19 we're all vaccinated boostered up I'm just wondering if we're going to escape this time around too
107006	I got my first shot of covid-19 vaccine this morning. So far still good, there's nothing to be worry, except now I'm feeling sleepy &amp; hungry üòÅ
201698	I never got a flu vaccine until I realized how much safer it was for my grandparents, my father-in-law, and babies in my circle. Yes, I might only be a carrier, but they could have severe symptoms and even die. Covid is the same. Minnesotans look out for each other. #VaccinesWork
105661	If the PCR tests work-Why the false positives?If the masks work-Why the 6 feet?If 6 feet works-Why the masks?If all three work-Why the lockdowns?If all four work-Why the vaccine?If the vaccine is safe-Why the no liability clause?If Covid-19 exists- it not been isolated?
106488	@SurvivalGirl1 @NYCAIeks @NYGovCuomo Considering that I already stated  that the Coronavirus  strain is known as COVID-19, I am not suprised.When they formulate this vaccine  it will save myriad lives  because people's bodies will be able to develop antibodies as a prophylactic measure to make them resistant.  üòÅüëç
107075	@sunethagampodi Hope you clearly know that this is false as a doctor.Almost all the child deaths were in unfortunate kids with chronic illnesses who had low immunity anyway.On the other hand unlike MMR vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines don't prevent infections, it only has a minor mortality benefit.
201503	Got my second COVID-19 vaccine earlier today, outside of a faint headache and a dull pain in my shoulder I'm feeling pretty okay so far. Will have to wait two more days for any side effects to come out, just hoping it'll go as smooth as my first vaccination did. https://t.co/XFehNH97HZ
106607	@GOPLeader Trump didn‚Äôt take responsibility for the spread of COVID-19 so he doesn't now get to take credit for a vaccine.
106316	So medics in a snowstorm can administer the vaccine to stranded motorists so not to waste it but a Dr. can't üò° RIDICULOUS!' #vaccine #coronavirus
107201	@Armandozim @ToddCoo72170990 @LinaHidalgoTX Well actually the other end is not working.... Why do you think cdc is no longer tracking breakthrough covid-19 cases they don't want you to know the truth vaccine are not working
106518	So I‚Äôve been offered a job as a care assistant (my third dream job ü•≤) but also they‚Äôve said that they can‚Äôt promise me that I don‚Äôt lose that job in the future if I don‚Äôt get the vaccine. üòì I totally understand that and thanked them for the offer. Goodbye my dream job. #COVID19
105913	So my girlfriend got her #COVID19 vaccine #ShotNo1 she's kinda felt #FluLike for a couple days. I just have a headache and my arm is sore lol
107179	Family being sick is always sad. This girl doesn't believe in vaccines but will take mother with kidney cancer to hospital to get chemo therapy? I doubt this family would be pleased to be taken to a hospital where doctors #DoNotComply and let anyone go up and down and do whatever
106848	Here‚Äôs a contrast. Yesterday, spoke with someone in Arizona ‚Äúreluctant‚Äù to get her #COVID19 vaccine. Why? Conspiracy theories. Today, a friend in #India who desperately wants a vaccine for her son said they can‚Äôt get it. We don‚Äôt realize how privileged we are in the US. Shameful.
105840	JUST IN - U.S. Army: Soldiers who refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine will be immediately discharged, Reuters reports.
105403	I signed up for initial vaccine testing (wasn't chosen), but this is a responsible position. #ncpol #NCSenateDebate #ncsen
107508	Aren‚Äôt republicans needing help to feed their families? Don‚Äôt they want to receive the vaccine? Aren‚Äôt they Americans? So sad they are divided.
106258	No way!. Research the vaccines. Amazing how bad it is. Why take it? I don't trust government information!
107549	Even finding a covid-19 vaccine won‚Äôt be enough to end the pandemicLimited supplies could create coronavirus haves and have-nots around the globe once a vaccine is manufactured
107501	This is really just a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the disabled and immune compromised ppl like myself‚Ä¶I have my vaccine, I have my booster and I‚Äôm abt to get another‚Ä¶but without a plan in place getting COVID-19 is fatal for me and for many others.
106997	For those wondering.....YES! I‚Äôm going to get the COVID-19 Vaccine whenever it‚Äôs my turn or time to do it. I WANT MY LIFE BACK!
105591	my dad is leading the research and development on a coronavirus vaccine and i just sat on a bong water wet spot on my computer chair and had a panic attack
106864	@PoliticsForAlI If @UKLabour oppose vaccine passports and they fail to get through parliament, and if they begin to actually oppose the Coronavirus legislation then I think many of us might even consider voting for them again, having ditched them years ago. @EssexPR?You reading, @Keir_Starmer?
106703	Trump's latest is to say every American will get coronavirus vaccine by April. Trump the scientist? Trump the drug manufacturer? We can't get enough paper towels or onion powder in our grocery stores! Flu vaccines run out every year even though the population no. is known.
106026	I want details-I have RA, I take methotrexate, and I‚Äôm still an ICU RN. But does this make sense without antibody testing, with unvaxxed coworkers, and so many places in the world without enough vaccines? Like I don‚Äôt even know what is fair or right.
107142	@crbarnes001 If someone's has had the so-called vaccine they will probably get a positive test result. But you will never really know the truth as to if she had a virus or not because post-mortem and coroners have been banned for anyone registered as a covid-19 death.
105571	So glad they accept the Docket App for the vaccine proof. Easy to use and has all the information needed
107672	@MinistryofTru16 @LibertyTre3 @TheFutureLover @McAuleyATL @kenklippenstein @EconCircus @KilldozerSZN Is the US not also producing the largest opioid crisis in history? Meanwhile the UK has provided key research for the coronavirus vaccine. Both are good systems, but to say the US is currently superior because of pure output isn‚Äôt something I agree with.
106453	What an idiot  this guy @prageru @DennisPrager . Where would we be in this country if horrible people like Prager had obstructed polio vaccine like they do #COVID ? Dead. Or crippled . That‚Äôs where
106161	"I listened, but I still can't actually believe what I heard..!The MINISTER FOR HEALTH says it's called ""COVID-19"" because there were 18 other coronaviruses before this one?And developing a vaccine will be difficult because they weren't successful with any of the previous 18?üôä"
106888	How is it possible that healthy people must be forced to isolate, not work, then not get paid cus they have come into contact with a likely vaccinated, testing, app loving , mask wearing person who can still pass it on and should be safe cus they are jabbed?
106119	@yevandy_ So scary. I'm just waiting for what people like them will say when the vaccine for COVID-19 comes out. It will be crazy üòÇüòÇüòÇ
201790	I'm so excited and relieved, I just booked my covid19 booster shot!!! Funny, it's EXACTLY 6 months to the day!!!
106136	Very stressful fews days helping to order in and set up the track and trace process for the Covid vaccine. Happy to see patients start to receive the vaccine, and proud to play a part in the first person in the world to receive it.
106443	@Lesliiiemarie so the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is made then what? i never took a flu shot before. so it‚Äôll be mandatory for everyone in the united states of america possibly the world to take the covid19 vaccine to be safe. ever wondered how many deaths a day from the flu?
107650	Kill me now. Waiting for a vaccine is pure idiocy and has zero scientific basis. There has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus, and it would be at best 30% effective, like a flu vaccine. It's a mutating virus. It's completely insane.
106282	@sunnydayrealaf @JamesonHook @KyleKulinski Actually, it‚Äôs something to do funds for a vaccine is why there is delay but with Covid-19 it‚Äôs impacted nearly everyone and the rich were or are losing money without workers to do their work. Funds has become available for Covid-19 because the economy was tanking
107468	This is why they are protesting,Why everyone else is not being denied American Covid-19 Vaccines &amp; these ppl in need, 90 miles away from Florida are not getting any aid?Wow...
107404	@subluxt @GeniusesqAx @Boy2020Patriot @CNN highly transmissible omicron variant ‚Äî which has demonstrated an ability to evade coronavirus vaccines, leading to a surge in breakthrough infections so basically the vaccine is overblown?
105994	Coronavirus is FAKE NEWS because the government is pretending people are sick because they want to give everyone a vaccine that makes you sick because something something 5G Bill Gates another double vodka please Davy now that brings me to microchips...
105753	@252ALLMZ @deelightfulEP @Cleavon_MD @alaskarebel If you legitimately care to understand how the mRNA covid-19 vaccine safely works to build immunity without a killed virus, I‚Äôm happy to take the time to explain it all.  If you‚Äôre just an AV peddler of known lies, I hope no one ignorant to science or basic facts is exposed 2u.
105349	I love how this guy apparently has a knob somewhere he can just turn whenever he wants to give out more vaccine.If this number is so easily adjustable, cut the bullshit &amp; just send it all.A news article announcing the increase makes you look a like a douche who's holding out.
105202	W T F???  Lol.  Why would anyone want a vaccine with a 99.7% survival rate?  Not to mention you get a vaccine and still must follow the draconian, nonsensical mask nonsense.üôÑ.  Yeah I‚Äôll pass.
105476	YET AGAIN!!!! Force us home &amp; require everyone that isn‚Äôt allergic to the vaccine to get it before they can work. Cause this is just stupid.
106747	A 90% effective vaccine that will deal with 20 or so mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes the COVID-19 disease) is coming.  If offered, will you take it?
105618	@kman_blac @TheTNHoller @tnhousegop This is a novel coronavirus. Meaning they‚Äôve never seen a virus like it before. Science takes time. The polio vaccine took decades to get right. It is a series of 4 shots giving to infants. We are at three shots now, 4 in Israel. It‚Äôs proven to save lives. Why fight it? #Science
106949	@DonnellyStephen On Pat Kenny talking about a vaccine passport? How come we don‚Äôt need one for measles? If you‚Äôre vaccinated surely it doesn‚Äôt matter then if I am? You‚Äôre an idiot! #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #lockdown2021
105286	Here‚Äôs one for any virologists/immunologists out there: if this Indian #Covid variant can partially evade antibodies of vaccinated people, will this not be an immediate catalyst for mutations which make it *completely* immune to the vaccines? How does this ever end?#COVID19
105521	@ANI So if I take the vaccine and something happens to me, then my family can't even sue the company I took vaccine of. Well then find a proper cure then only I will be taking it.@pmo @aajtak @AJEnglish @dwnews @ndtv #covid19
107647	@KAMRLocal4News Now they want help financially when the COVID-19 vaccine is free????? SMFH don't feel sorry for these people
107155	So I‚Äôm ngl my #NHSCovidVaccine has knocked me out today, woke up with possibly every side effect and felt awful, I‚Äôm drained and still don‚Äôt feel 100% but it‚Äôs all going to be worth it. So definitely go get your vaccine when you can! #CovidVaccine #COVID19
106667	"The first bill after a ""free"" vaccine Vaccine: Free! (:Talking to the receptionist: $300Nurse discussing procedure: $700Medical grade needle: $400Doctor shows up for 2 mins: $1000"
105256	"@jtodd8200 @HaimishTheRed @agalligani @Jim_Jordan People immigrating to the US have to have a COVID-19 vaccine as of Oct 1st of this year when they get their medical eval. If they don't have the vaccine then they don't get their medical evaluation completed, and their immigration process can't continue. That's the ""how""."
107607	@InteriorsAvenue @Kat_La @vinthropologist What do you call someone that is not against taking the MMR vaccine but not COVID-19 jab? Are they an antivaxxer? Or someone that has taken all vaccines that is against mandatory vaccination? Are they an antivaxxer?
107105	@DebtandCupcakes My understanding is that the specific virus that causes the common cold has enough mutation every year that we have to ‚Äúre learn‚Äù how to fight itFlu vacc. are a ‚Äúguess‚Äù on which strain is most commonI believe COVID-19 is unique enough and low mutation that vaccine would work
106574	My mom just received her first #COVID19Vaccine! The process was so fast and efficient, and everyone has been amazing. Thank you @ROWPublicHealth! #COVID19 #grateful #wrawesome
201679	So, I got my second dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine a bit under 24 hours ago. Feeling fatigued; weak in the limbs and joints. No fever (yet). Otherwise, nothing too serious.Please go get yours asap if you are eligible.
105221	**Genuinely Curious** If someone had caught #COVID19 &amp; had minor symptoms but their body built/grew antibodies to fight the virus why would they still need the Vaccine?
105831	@seanhannity @RandPaul They don't want to shut down covid19 they want to push there vaccine thats killing people plus there's an election coming up so they have a chance to cheat
105347	@Belly_sleeazy Besides me I don't think I've met a younger person who's taking the covid-19 vaccine üíâ
105206	@dkdmac ‚ÄòMyth: The COVID-19 vaccines don't work because you can still get COVID after vaccination.Fact: COVID-19 vaccination will protect most people from getting sick with COVID-19, ranging from 66% to 100% effective.‚ÄôI think it‚Äôs clear that is not true. Everyone is still getting it.
105415	This world have went to hell since the coronavirus and the COVID-19 vaccine came here all of this is drawling people from the Lord and people don‚Äôt want to go church now because of it we need to be in church in this time what this world is going through we need to pray for world
105647	Some people think this coronavirus is a scar tactic... thinking that the vaccine was made back in 2017 or something but they seem to forget it‚Äôs a different strain...... meaning that the vaccine wouldn‚Äôt work.........
105371	@superdupergrump @MollyJongFast Fwiw I'm not some anti vaxxer. I get all my Dr reccd vaccines. How CV19 evolves is an unknown at this point. It could very well end up being like other coronavirus that aren't so much as deadly, as they are just an annual nuisance.
106271	@HelenBranswell @mariojoze EPIC is a problematic format 4 vaccine information, since EPIC was 1st developed as a billing system. QR codes are an elitist tool - many hv no smartphones. Better example is California's Blue Shield and Kaiser Permanente partnership in the CA COVID-19 vaccine rollout this year.
106036	Nice this is going to be @JoeBiden, Rioting and Looting with no recourse, send the vaccine to Iran and China before we give it to our own vulnerable people.  @joeb is a National Disgrace #BidenCrimeFamilyExposed #BidenCrimeFamily
105551	Vaccine maniacs say, well you took medicine for cancer so why don‚Äôt you just take the vaccine? I did due diligence on specific treatments and my doctors gave me the choice, never a mandate. I chose integrative treatments, natural and pharma, but it was my choice. #COVID19
105910	Uh Adam troll - fortunately I have not yet contracted Covid but I am confident that should I the vaccine will keep me from having serious symptoms #mepolitics so very brave you are

105946	Wether people want to acknowledge it or not EVERYONE who has taken the jab is enrolled in the vaccine trials. EUA is not the same as an FDA approved. This is sad and never should have happened
105399	That's great, and I'm not paranoid, but all a video would show is a president being stuck with a needle. Could be saline. I will still get the vaccine when I'm allowed, I'm just saying....
107563	Dogs have had a vaccine against coronavirus for years .I  don't understand why the  Health Officials don'come up with  o ne for humans. Also, any dogbreeder could have to told them  that  it's extremely contagious even w no symptoms present. I ccm really disappointed in  govt ppl

105217	Seriously everyone research what‚Äôs exactly in these so called vaccines that gates donated so much money to get off and running and to vaccinate the whole world hmmm
105919	@RN1814 @SchmittNYC Wow you still hiding under your bed. You do realize there will never be a vaccine for this Coronavirus it‚Äôs always mutating, that‚Äôs the nature of the Coronavirus. The common cold is a Coronavirus, no vaccine. So Enjoy eternity in your home.
201771	Received my second #COVID19 vaccine this morning. Arm less sore than the first and no other symptoms. The significance of this moment is not lost on me. Hoping we can make the vaccine more accessible to the public in the coming weeks! #PfizerCovidVaccine https://t.co/A1gs6HlnI9

107281	They should first prove to us that this vaccine is actually going to be a vaccine.&amp;that it will be to help reduce the symptoms of Covid19. If they are able to prove these two points,then people should take it.Yet just an experiment with vaccine is likely to yield few good results
106030	I don't understand why this is being promoted.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  This is not optics.  It's not strategic. It's not even coherent given the spotligbt on HQ and UV light therapy.#novaccines
106559	That's great for the US but no way Trump lets the rest of the world get any if they find the vaccine.
105445	I feel like it ought be stated up front that the person whom died was in the control group and did not recieve the vaccine.
106989	Here we go! So now every soulless dipshit will be dumping their pets in the streets or killing them. The C in pet vaccines (like DHLPP-C vax) is corona. Corona has existed FOREVER... it is the COMMON COLD. These MSM Morons are trying to create fear. DO NOT DUMP YOUR PETS! (con't)
106216	What‚Äôs wrong with this country? Are Gbajabiamila and all the people pushing that bill to pass going to line up and take the Coronavirus vaccine first? Even if they gave them money? How can they be pushing through a bill that will endanger their lives? #StoptheNCDCBill
105465	@QuintonLucasKC Why are people even discussing this. The common cold is a coronavirus and there has never been a successful vaccine or cure or even treatment for it. Covid-19 is a much more complex cv so it will not happen. Accept it. And if they do get one the virus will mutate making it void

105629	ok idk anything about this but why is CV19 research not just open source? wouldn't we be finding a vaccine quicker and then be able to manufacture it quicker?
105622	Many unknowns with one constant: Herd Immunity seems to be the only answer against the #PandemicCovid19, but how we achieve it differs. Vaccine or enough people get infected.
105907	Bottom line...until they come out with a vaccine for COVID19 and it's free, I'm most likely not going back to any kind of regular job dealing with the public. Certain controlled circumstances with trusted people, maybe. But the job world is fucked up right now.
105867	He tested negative and still has to sit. It's an insanely dumb rule. But, getting the vaccine isn't a big deal and he could have avoided these stupid rules but decided to risk it.
105475	@Noahpinion @NoahCRothman IIRC Chinavax was made with A coronavirus, not THE covid-19 because they were trying to beat everyone to market for prestige.They did. But it's not a covid vaccine and it doesn't protect like one.
105733	@ohiojennie @Idunnowhat6 @CNN There is no deadly virus. It has been a hoax all along. I had my account suspended, yesterday so, I lost all my video evidence.

106733	@DraftTulsi Thats my problem honestly it was made too fast. What will happen when another new coronavirus comes. Will they say the same vaccine is gonna work?
105547	Lockdown Will not stop the spread It will only slowdown the spread The only way to stop the covid19 is to made a vaccine @narendramodi

107287	Giving vaccines to everyone is good idea but what about testing everyone?What is World's Best CM waiting for to Test every 11.40 Cr Population of Maharashtra?Why no one wants to test everyone but hell bent on giving vaccines before testing?
106618	no one wants this vaccine... especially those who are not sick, ('asymptomatic'='not sick')... stupid as hell to inject disease into your body... but ya'll are pushin' worse than drug dealers... tryin' to make folks think they want this... death... a crime against humanity (:~:)
106184	I know everyone is a bit nervous about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. I got mine today at 1026. I did it for my mom, my family, my friends, and my patients. I was a bit sentimental and cried because of those patients we lost despite everything we did. This was especially for them.
106481	when/if they come out with a covid-19 vaccine, will you be getting it or are you skeptical about the motives/agenda and decline the vaccine? ü§î
106948	You think they will tell you if the vaccine is safe for you before you take it? What about me? Better yet what about my kids? Will they be forced to take something made to kill them? You think something is wrong with me now let something happen to one of my kids. Life changing.
105627	I just got another nutty email about my column from Friday.  One of his crazy conspiracy theories is that Bill Gates refused the Covid vaccine because he's in the know and feels it's too dangerous.I don't have the heart to send this back to the person.
105673	@JamesDesmond99 @KerryAnnSmith1 As I keep pluggingCovid19 has no loyalty to any Political Party or Person.It only understands the Absolute state of the art, latest most science driven solutions until a workable safe vaccine arrives.Period.
201640	@FrancyDias9 ‚úãyou bet i am wearing one in public. Plus vaccinated and a booster.  My sister died of covid19 before the vac. Came to the west coast.
105889	@leenorman54 The CMO said it is inevitable that everyone will get coronavirus over the next few years, just like the common cold that goes around and around. A vaccine may stop it, but that's a way off.
105381	So covid-19 antibodies may sometimes also respond to human proteins, causing autoimmune issues. The vaccines use the same protein to trigger the immune response, so may cause similar responses. This possibility is supported by an increased incidence of anaphylaxis
106670	@WhiteHouse @DeborahBirx How far away is a vaccine? Or information on why COVID-19 mutates so fast? Or what can slow it down once it enters lungs
201798	First it was take any shot you can get‚Ä¶so I took AZ‚Ä¶.then it evolved to take any shot you can get but not AZ so I took Moderna‚Ä¶.by the time I get to the booster will they be flat out giving only Pfizer?
106094	So Today, Moderna is leading the pack to develop a new vaccine for the SARS-coronavirus?  I guess it helps if you've been working on it a year before it happened.Such geniuses at Moderna!! How could they possibly know a SARS-coronavirus pandemic would come only 1 year later?
105240	This is how pharma companies make their money. It is not with a once a year vaccine it is the once-a-month, week, or day drug they push on you. The covid drug will become something you will need to take monthly, weekly, or even daily. Are you freakin awake yet!!!
107376	"@Independent Can you still get Covid after the vaccine? YES, YOU CAN. You can still spread coronavirus,even after getting the vaccine so continue to wear a Face Mask üò∑!Don't be an "" Ignorant Imbecile""!"
105709	@jonslinn @PienaarJm @plaforscience No, I don't think you understand - the suggestion is that the inflenza vaccine it makes the elderly more susceptible to severe illness from Covid19.   Vaccines interact with immune systems, this may not always be beneficial.
105553	@philhowells @chrischirp The fact you have had two jabs and still got it is very revealing.My hunch is now, if you are ok and clear it, you will not catch it again this year and if you do next year, it will feel the same as a more common coronavirus cold.

105774	@zchagla It's a coronavirus. They can form part of the answer, but utter obsession in vaccinating the whole population with a vaccine that only has emergency use authorisation is downright odd. More so when in relation to those who are not vulnerable to the disease itself.

105995	@TVRav These measures are going to be in place for a long time. People keep saying wait until September. September will be the same. Not all students will be back in. Social distancing is not going anywhere as without a vaccine Covid-19 is not going anywhere.

201564	Aight so, I didn‚Äôt want to get vaccinated, but my daughter thought I was going to die (I‚Äôd already had covid) if I didn‚Äôt get the jab.  Here‚Äôs my question: how many of you that have gotten the vaccine now have ear problems? #VaccineSideEffects #COVID19
201685	@ryanfield The vaccine is just a money maker for Pfizer and it doesn't eradicate the virus and because it doesn't the shot will have to be updated and given at least four times of year. I get COVID-19 at this point it's like getting a cold because I've had 3 shots. I've had enough.
106370	A vaccine may never come.None came for HIV.We MAY die if we re-open for business, yes. But, we WILL die if we stay locked down too long. Living has risks. Which do you choose?

105388	@EastSideJay99 @AmyAThatcher Just one quick point to forestall your first gotcha: the scientific name of covid-19 is SARS-COV-2.

106231	@NHSEngland NHS improvement, speaking about that. I would like to know, if adverse reactions to the Covid-19 vaccine are common incidents these days and if so, have these exponentially gained momentum? I hear so many of my friends having problems after their boosters. So I am not taking any.
107516	PLEASE RT!  Besides numerous deaths of some of Pfizer's C-19 vaccine volunteers, now this! Is this vaccine really an infertility vaxx? Just one more reason NOT to get any of these vaccines. Instead, eat healthy and beef up your immune system ANDüö´annual Flu Vaccine
107121	I think it might not come such a time in my view. Once a pandemic it remains in circulation as long as transmission patterns don't change. We need WHO, CDC and all players to come up with vaccine as we adhere to containment measures given by MOH. Likewise, we commit it to God.
105848	Still no news on when I might could get a coronavirus vaccine, but I sure have gotten multiple news alerts pushed to my devices updating me on the whereabouts of Lady Gaga's dogs. What an age we live in.
106387	I‚Äôm iffy on mandatory vaccines, maybe since I was a hesitant one, but hospitals I think it‚Äôs the right call. Same with home care. If you are working hands in with the vulnerable like this you gotta protect yourself
105287	Love when clinical trials work themselves out like this. Slow down and do it the correct way and stop trying to be the first company to make a vaccine because you want the funding
105534	@Stratusdog42 @CBCNews Agreed. The sign shows that there has never been a vaccine for any coronavirus ever and all have phased out due to strong T cell immunity.
105640	WHO doctor says lockdowns should not be main coronavirus defenceThe US is starting to work smart in SEVERAL counties and states, the only numbers going up is the number of people with adverse reactions from the so called VACCINES. So why do we insisti in this stupidity?

105384	So it has come to my attention that in my clip from the movie @MedicatingNorm1 involving @kellybroganmd and it turns out this person is Anti-Vax. Make no mistake Vaccines save lives. Coronavirus is real and unfortunately I made a mistake by not doing a google search.
105785	And further.  I am tired of being treated and spoken to as if I am a disease, because I live in Toronto.  I do not live my life as if getting rid of Covid19/21 is my primary goal in life. Neither do I live my life waiting for some miraculous vaccine.  There is a life to live.
107213	I will not take the vaccine bc @BillGates is involved &amp; wants to put a micro nano-chip in the vaccine. The govt would have to guarantee they did not put anything in the vaccine.

106679	@NateSilver538 They would not be known to be safe if used together. One problem with coronavirus is the virus actually doesn‚Äôt do a lot of damage. Most of the disease is unchecked inflammation. We want a vaccine to prevent that fire not make it worse.
107668	If you take this vaccine you are a total fool. Even Bill Gates said a Coronavirus vaccine will kill 700k+ each year taken. This is a cull. The biggest fear is we become herd immune to it. They are rushing the real killer this vaccine ASAP.
106455	@chridano @thejuraisout @DanHitchings @VancityReynolds @jessicamalaty Nope! Covid19 is a strain of coronavirus called SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2. Researchers have been working on a generic vaccine for SARS viruses for years. They were able to build on that research. Because Covid is so infectious and has spread so quickly, they have been able to test widely.

107610	@Ms_Michelle_Roy @MarkFriesen08 It's not a vaccine. mRNA is a medical device.

Not going to risk an autoimmune issue like Cytokine Storm.

105798	Why is Bill Gates so pro-vaccine? Is any other rich billionaire donating so many millions of dollars towards a vaccine!? ü§î
106278	Making a vaccine for Coronavirus is not as complicated as making one for AIDS or cancer. It is in the same family as the flu and other Covid viruses. They make a new flu shot every year to predict which strain will be most prominent. This is why the C19 vaccine was made so quick
106934	@DrTomFrieden How come none of those vaccines made it to market?  This is not like other coronavirus, just going to ignore that particular issue?
105440	@GOP keep promoting the anti-vaccine silliness. Is wearing you and your followers down slowly but surely. Blame Trump for downplaying the virus and running off to play golf, only to eventually get his shots, never to confirm it. No sympathy if you play with fire, and get burnt.

107509	80% (or as close as we can get) vaccine coverage and rolling booster shots (like we do with flu) and I'll accept we need to move on. Until then we're just accepting unnecessary death.  Restrictions can't last forever which is why we need to ramp up vaccines globally.
105679	Not convinced this is safe until we have a vaccine for Covid-19 as being stuck in a crowded train will spread the virus big time especially if someone doesn't wear a mask and has it even if they don't know they're infected
106801	See how when the vaccines started to roll out in March and April the spread went down üòÉNow see how there‚Äôs a big population that doesn‚Äôt like it and it‚Äôs all worse How does that logic work someone explain it to me how do you see it get better and say it‚Äôs bad
107357	@TAHPAO2019 @debbiehockey @EmmaKennedy In the case of Covid-19 there is currently no herd immunity. Without a vaccine that is a long long way off.It is spelt 'herd'.The moment you called ma a 'thicko' you lost any respect I may have had for you or your position.Have a good day.
201725	So, my daughter had covid in January, got the vaccine in May, was diagnosed with covid again today. I decided to get the vaccine today &amp; within 1 hour had a severe reaction. Tell me again what the vaccines are doing to stop covid?#vaccine #COVID19 #vaccinesdontwork

105634	@timbuctoo123 @prayingmedic Dr. Mikovits stated that anyone who has received the flu vaccine will test positive for Covid-19 because of the way they create the vaccine.

106298	I had wondered if what really strains healthcare resources is vaccine skeptics who don't go to the hospital until their symptoms are extremely bad, maybe if they went earlier they could've survived the Covid illness, and easier for hospital staff too - no ICU, no venting, etc.
106666	@PharmaBlue And they don‚Äôt want to give vaccines to the pharmacists when they aren‚Äôt even offering health benefits for these positions. So we just risk getting COVID-19 and then pay out of pocket if we get sick?? ü§Ø

106181	Very realistic. I don't think people understand how important J&amp;J is. They don't have to make sure you are covered for both doses like with Pfizer and Moderna. They can get the vaccine, stab you, and move on.

If we are comparing the smallpox vaccine and the Covid-19 vaccine the I think it is fair to say it took about a year since the first cases were recorded in November. But the question is, could we have gotten a vaccine earlier?
106402	@SueReed31273001 @richardhorton1 Highly unlikely it will until we know the ling term effects of covid19. Oxford has recently begun a study to address these concerns, but it will take a couple of months for us to see any results. If they want to do challenge studies this will delay the release of a vaccine.
107544	ANY company that forces vaccinations on their people should be sued if anyone gets sick or has a severe reaction to the Covid vaccine! @JohnTory you are not God sir and have no right to force injections on anyone.

106571	The fact that we are on course to (hopefully) crush this virus in less than 2 years is impressive. I figure I'll get the vaccine in August, if the schedule goes as planned.

106859	There are costs incurred with our without a vaccine registry.    The more accurate question is if the cost is greater when we don't keep track. This has been a long-pursued goal of public health for decades.  #COVID19 represents the current pressing need.  There will be others.

107091	@oldloggie1 @davidhogg111 Riddle me this! If you've had #COVID19 and overcome it. Do you still ü§î need the vaccine?
105361	@MarikaSboros Actually, I'm still in phase 3 of my alcohol trial. It's going on 45 years now...so far, so good. When Covid-19 vaccine trials have been conducted over 45 months, I'm in üòÇ
201533	So I was thinking letting workers who travels outside go get their vaccine first....But I will get my COVID-19 vaccine too that I have made. And I already fixed it.
107555	@SkyNews So Where's the vaccine for Cancer that kills 10mn/yr. Billions poured into covid-19 vaccine whilst UK only funds ¬£200mn/yr into Cancer research. This paltry sum is cruel inhumane action &amp; we need justice for all the sufferers. Y has the world turned their back on these people
105314	@MattHancock #NoMasks #NoNewNormal #NoVaccines. Teach people how to boost their immune system. It will save the NHS. PS: Why do you now call it Coronavirus and not 'Covid' ?? ü§î
107098	YouTube took down a video a year ago about a video I made before the coronavirus vaccine talking about why I don't support the vaccine ü§£This is the first time they took a video of mine down. I only have 52 subscribers. They really want you to get that lovely jab üòèü§£
106330	@TeamBaDJane @WorldofNC Coronavirus is on the run due to the vaccine.unvaccinated will pass it on to other unvaccinated people and some will get it either mildly,seriously or may die.vaccinated people will only get it mildly and as trialled will not end up in hospital or die.long covid is serious.i know
107089	My wife works in Healthcare in Alaska. I think Alaska was the first state to get the vaccine for Healthcare workers. @SidneyPowell1She showed me a memo 3 weeks ago stating that 11,000 vaccines were coming to Alaska.They offered the vaccine to anyone that wanted it.

106715	@trumptrain1111 @YMcglaun No love for Bill Gates here but I'm pretty sure he wasn't born yet when I ate a little sugar cube with polio vaccine in it. So I'm doubtful of the paralyzing kids with it part. No I wouldn't want any part of his coronavirus vaccine.
106583	@GovInslee FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus. EVER.
106047	@PrisonPlanet Sad, the worst part is she did it she said to protect her cancer patients but the vaccine according to the experts only reduces symptoms, it cannot stop a person from getting or spreading covid19.
106739	Lol y‚Äôall do know when the coronavirus vaccines come out that they will have the coronavirus in the vaccine itself
105222	"The Prophet of God called this vaccine ""a literal Godsend"". In my mind, that eliminates any excuse for not getting it. You either trust the Prophet or you don't. Unless you have some valid, diagnosed medical reason not to get this specific vaccine, this should be no problem."
107439	"""People have a bad habit of anthropomorphizing the coronavirus: ascribing human-like intentions to it, as if a microbe can discern that we finally have a vaccine and try to evade it. But viruses don‚Äôt really have any schemes; they just reproduce."""

105815	Only 51% of Americans surveyed now say they would get a #coronavirus vaccine, a 21 point drop from May, the Pew Research Center said Thursday.
107086	@ollietheantijab @zxcvbnlkjhgf Absolutely, they knew when they passed the Coronavirus Act for a whole 2 years, to give themselves enough time to implement this tyranny, with all the restrictions on our freedoms dependent on vaxxs and ‚Äúhealth‚Äù passports.When are the moronic mask wearers going to wake-up??
106723	"@CocoKnowsItAll @robinmonotti Its early days. Going on previous attempts at a coronavirus vaccine, the ferrets used in the trial all died, once exposed to the virus in the wild. Hence why ""new strains"" is being pushed by the media.. Just in case they need an excuse üòè"

106301	@Lrihendry They probably have a vaccine. And had one before they spread this on the world on purpose. They kicked out media! China cannot be trusted. Need mfg back here. Deep state Dems in on it @GOP @realDonaldTrump #CoronavirusPandemic #coronavirus
106188	The reason COVID is so severe in this country is because of their poor leadership. It is ridiculous that they get the vaccine before people like this.

105566	Just got my first COVID19 vaccine trading card.Time to get this bad boy a hard case and sent off to get graded.If anyone finds a booster box lmk.
107118	Can we all agree that we don't need to see anymore members of Congress tweeting out the fact that they are getting preferential treatment with the COVID vaccine. I don't think it's having the impact they intended.
107556	@DineshDSouza Would you be able to to explain to me why/how the COVID-19 vaccines are free? Does this free vaccine help the economy? If it does, how/whom? I appreciate your input. DM in messages if you like.
106358	@billmaher If a fully vaccinated person can test positive for Covid-19 but not have any symptoms and not have enough viral strength to infect others, why must that person self-isolate?This nonsense causes people don‚Äôt trust the vaccine!Does it work or doesn‚Äôt it?
105885	Heights a person can reach just for getting votes. It's understood that there will be severe side effects of this vaccine. Why @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #American_election #DonaldTrump #

106173	G.I. guinea pigs? How many will get sick/die from this? Will it be mandatory for all? I find this unsettling, since COVID has a low mortality rate. It's not the bubonic plague. Yes, a vaccine for plagues that kills tens of millions, but CV19 has killed 0.6M, many already sick.
107239	"The ermegence of a virus #variant in relation to single #vaccine doses is ""speculative"" says WHO's Dd Joachim Hombach, but:""We do not know if there is durable immunity and how long it lasts. So there is certainly a high risk of breakthrough infections."""
105741	Just insane. Yes this is happening and yes it is eerily 1930s like. Those that think these comparisons are exaggeration are either in denial about what is happening or very naive. #Wakeup #NoVaccinePassports #novaccinemandates
201554	I'm Frankly getting somewhat frantic about getting a Covid-19 vaccine. @Vp @potus @GovTimWalz 55 and immunocompromised. WHEN IS IT MY TURN!  Just put back scenes in any arm that wants one.
107054	@johnferreyra17 @realDonaldTrump The coronavirus isn't going to disappear until 100% of the world's population has been infected or vaccinated with an effective Covid-19 vaccine. We need to have massive vaccines before we reopen the economy.
106497	that is for everyone to make up their own minds.If you have had a Coronavirus vaccine and have developed a side effect PLEASE report it to the Government Yellow Card System.
106535	@jonfromcali @dvmmum @KyleBJorrey Vaccines don‚Äôt stop you from being infected and they don‚Äôt stop you from transmitting it either. So please explain to me how your vaccine helps protect me.
107482	I just got my mother an appointment for #COVID19 vaccine, and I am happy crying cause I was able to do it before they ran out within 3 minutes üò≠
106628	They should first test the Covid19 vaccine on government officials.. If they are safe vaccine is good, But if they die, the country is safe!!

I don‚Äôt like Pfizers vaccine, it sounds like they cut &amp; sliced DNA.
106172	oh btw guys a US pharma company is in the court to prevent china getting COVID19 vaccine because they gon sell it for 50-100$ per person and China after getting the vaccine planning to distribute it for free.
105631	We will continue to get vaccines in the arms of folks like Mr Pillord below @The_BMC and elsewhere, whilst we root for manufacturers and supply chains to get them to our sites ASAP. We are rooting for everyone to get this to work. #CiaoCovid.
107160	Wonder if Tesla drivers could volunteer to deliver COVID-19 vaccine to rural hospitals in need. @tesla could give those in the volunteer group free Supercharging to sponsor the event. I‚Äôd like to help somehow. @kimpaquette ??
107203	@JonIsAwesomest we developed a dozen coronavirus vaccines in nine months but haven't worked out a non-addictive morphine in two centuries?c'mon, science.  i want to like you.

201641	Doing the work of mystery Babylon...listen to the guy who got jabbed, sounds just like the television.
107645	Religious places should be shut down till the vaccines arrives.See no one is going to die without going to prayer places,they can worship in home too but they might die if they go to there now amid this pandemic.No god is going to curse you for not coming to worship them!

106056	These frontline workers who refuse the #COVID19 vaccine are playing Russian Roulette with not just their lives but every other life they come in contact with.  This is s-o-o-o FUBAR!
106605	like he didn't receive polio vaccine. It's good to believe but some things are not meant to be taken for granted. I will see what he will do when the UK govt start making it compulsory for travellers entering their country to get vaccinated.
106269	@Canada_Dystopia The rush is their worst nightmare. As with previous coronavirus vaccines, this one is enhancing variant strains and ppl are getting really sick.
201542	Third day muscle pain is located to my bicep and I can feel my body start to tear this apart. More HSP symptoms are presenting themselves, and while none of those symptoms are fun, I still gotta watch myself #CovidVaccine #CovidIsNotOver #COVID19
105979	@disclosetv So what is the intention of these vaccines?....it is not the protection against the coronavirus ü§î
106053	How are we going to do that without a vaccine? No vaccine no heard immunity. The Antibodies are lasting weeks or less.
107403	@SHarris518 @POTUS No coronavirus has ever had a vaccine developed. Even if we get 1 it will likely b less than 50% effective, which means a larger number of people likely won't get one, adding. I agree therapeutics is the way to go. The rest I believe is futile. Wash hands, drink OJ. Respectfully
106362	Hope has arrived! It will take months, but we‚Äôre now on our way out of this. So, don‚Äôt give up the fight now.Wear a mask. Maintain social distance. Be smart. And *be here* when it‚Äôs your time for the vaccine.Let‚Äôs all survive this now and celebrate like hell when it‚Äôs done.
106643	@NASA @NASA_Astronauts @Astro_Soichi @JAXA_en @NOGGINKids Will astronauts get the Covid-19 vaccine or can they decline to have it if they are personally against being injected?
105739	I really hope it comes to that! The new variant (plus this variant's variant now) is so terrifying, esp. bc the vaccine will be less effective. This applies to the B1351 as well. HQ is not adequate!
106690	@VlkzOstravy @washingtonpost @MorganStanley How do you think the globalists got a huge supply of miracle vaccines in short order. They money laundered through Afghanistan. Then they created a coronavirus pandemic. Our benefactors are psychopaths.
105611	Logically the peak is 2 - 3 weeks after Easter just like it was after Xmas. Hope we get enough vaccines before May 24
107305	@denverpost @kierannicholson Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks.

105669	Omg why are humans do fucking dumb I hate it hereeeeeejust bc u get the vaccine u CAN STILL GET COVID.
105899	@margauxdemerle @realDonaldTrump I am really hoping this isn't true.  But these days who knows.  The @UN should be coordinating vaccine research and dispersal.  It should go first to where the need is greatest.  If covid-19 has taught us anything, we are one planet.  Boarders are meaningless. We are all humans.
106133	Had my COVID-19 vaccine today, just doing my part to help the world return to normality. @piersmorgan keep preaching how important this is to help us get back on track after the governments poor handling :)
106647	"so now that there's ""chismis"" going around Mandaue City Public Market (since we do have business there) na we have to get vaccinated to enter the market...my mom's getting the vaccine somehow but she's afraid to get vacs due to her high blood."
106626	@NI_Citizen_69 @paddyakker @AlexKane221b Why are employers sacking the un-vaxxed - the vaxxed can still get Covid-19 and still spread it to others - so there is no protection of staff or customers ??? Can any employer or manager or MP explain this ???
106122	@sandwichtable69 @TwTankersley @PaulStanleyLive Influenza vaccine is around 70% effective, so in no way would any virologists expect to see a Covid19 vaccine offer complete protection. You also seem to think that chickenpox vaccine is 100% effective too. It's not like the information isn't readily available. ü§¶
107003	@robertscott661 @JamesGr49498338 @Warnzwifey @BorisJohnson Some slack heads think we should have lockdown until zero deaths. We may never have a vaccine it may be seasonal just like flu we might have to live with it forever. A different coronavirus is the cause of most common colds. It's just life. Natural immunity will squash it
106776	I can still get it! If I contract it in the next 14 days the vaccine would've been for nothing but I'd also have some immunity for an unknown amount of time.If I get covid after the 14 days, I'm a lot more likely to be asymptomatic then before the vaccine. üíúü¶Ü

105822	Petition to make initial access to a COVID-19 vaccine conditional on mask wearing. If you don't believe in science now, why should you be able to use it to get a vaccine before the rest of us?
106912	US has to vaccinate the world. Please don't expose people to sinovaccine. It will be terrible. People can and are getting infected with coronavirus after being vaccinated. This may mean people in the future will not want to get vaccinated.#PeoplesVaccine #FreeTheVaccine
201739	I knew about this but it‚Äôs still pretty amazing how a system can be so ridiculous. My grandparents needed to travel 400 km from their home to get COVID-19 vaccinations, as it was the only place with free spots for vaccine.#COVID19Vaccination #Polska
201539	@NPRHealth I have RA, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, asthma, treated cancer with chemo and radiation in 2019. I had my 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 3/27. I only felt sore at the injection spot, some joint pain and a little fever for less than 24 hours. Always Ask your doctor
105620	I‚Äôm no scientist or whatever but if they just integrate the COVID-19 vaccine in alcoholic drinks, we‚Äôd achieve herd immunity by Saturday night. No cappin.

107037	@darinsquared @RealTenille There would be no need for COVID-19 protocols to protect people if there were other ways. There is only social distancing and masks wearing. In many months, there will be a vaccine or two.
105943	I still think we could do more, but today I'm proud that my country doesn't just think of us. We don't do vaccine nationalism. Every human being on this planet matters and we won't defeat Covid-19 if we don't provide vaccines for everyone on this planet.
107644	@NeilClark66 @ejaz_nouman Coronavirus pandemic will become more deadly and destructive to our normal lives if it gets mixed-up with seasonal viral flu , a safe and effective vaccine is therefore necessary asap
107222	@jwaldag @liberal_party @erinotoole Here‚Äôs a story I just heard from my dentist-apparently #tamarajansen went to get her #COVID19 vaccine but didn‚Äôt bring any ID.

106029	Did they need a vaccine? No. Did they equate the only possible response to Covid-19 is a Vaccine? No. Did they ban flights and acted fast to opt for medical solution? Yes. Duterte's take only having the vaccine as the only solution is evident enough to say...
107278	Please take any Coronavirus surveys from the DNA companies so we can help find a vaccine or a medical solution to this pandemic. It only takes a few minutes of your time. I know that MyHeritage is doing a survey. I did my part.
201666	Last Wednesday, April 7th 2021;My hubby and I drove to Nephi, Ut. to get my 2nd #COVID19 shot. By evening I had some pain in my arm, where the shot was and I massaged it, helping to break up the liquid of the vaccine. I started getting Chills, Fever,Nassau with vomiting, etc.üò∑ https://t.co/j8hykENFTI
105757	@nirav_mainecdc Discrepancies in reporting. Maine is getting more/less vaccines depending upon different sources. How convenient! Less vaccines fits narrative of why Maine is not prioritizing long-term care facilities? Outrageous! Do not try to say that you are doing a good job!
106539	25 million #COVID19 Vaccines is not even a drop in the bucket compared to the world's need. It's time to #SAVE the world and Share America's Vaccines with Everyone. #VOWNow #ShareTheShots
105567	Hydroxychloroquine has proven to be a real treatment for COVID-19 but since Trump was the first one to say it, the left and the FDA are going to make sure they keep it away from Americans so they can promote another Bill Gates vaccine. #Hydroxychloroquine #WakeUpAmerica
105871	@juil_yoon @oclsc @TheoMoudakis @TorontoStar See they claim to do research yet sound like lunatics. Did you even fukin know that when the polio or the measles came out, people took a vaccine immediately with way less data than today‚Äôs very effective and safe Covid19 vaccine. Where is the polio today? Time to grow up kids
107609	Why should either one of them get a vaccine for a hoax? They should‚Äôve been last in line for all the death they‚Äôve caused!
107004	@mrscorer Think you need to do a bit of research. They are between 40-60% and we‚Äôve had the flu vaccine for 70+ years. People believed Covid-19 vaccines were 95% effective in 9 months ü§£ huh? 1000 deaths? 150?

106166	@KisakumaCosplay Well, we indeed have reasons to think that things will get better in 2021, like the COVID-19 vaccine. But we certainly have to keep pushing if we want things to get better, and not assume it will happen on it's own.

105812	@SethAbramson I fear this might become like the flu, where a vaccine won't be wholly effective every year. (Although, based on how they're trying to develop an all-encompassing flu shot, maybe you could do the same if you could tease out the *original* Covid-19 strain.)
105573	It‚Äôs the year 2025 and we‚Äôre just going into our 16th national lockdown, which they say will definitely see the beginning of the end of this coronavirus. The promised vaccine is just weeks away, again. #Lockdown2 #Covid19UK

105513	@SecAzar @JapanEmbDC This is good, but you should be updating the nation about the #coronavirus potential pandemic on an almost hourly basis, considering you are essentially the point-man for handling this disease.   Will there be a worldwide epidemic? Is a vaccine coming? Please inform us!
107397	@AertbyLisa I've had a flu jab each year. A mild cold will permanently worsen my ME/CFS, but a flu jab just makes me a bit worse for a week.They say COVID-19 and the flu are a deadly combination, and the first person to die in Europe was a young man who had both, so I'm getting it again.

107314	Glad I didn't lose my vaccine card. I feel like everywhere is going to require this for any event in the future!
105740	&lt;what happens if there is no vaccine? hopeful there is, but there is no guarantee or that it will be anymore effective than the seasonal flu shot is preventing the flu&gt;
105773	@BrandonPerna @AdamSchefter Have to wonder how any of these contracts will work out. There isn't going to be an NFL season until there is a COVID-19 vaccine. How can any team sport deal with sick or contagious players that will have to sit for 14 days at a time?
106426	@GavinNewsom The mortality rate is so low. Plus there's a vaccine on deck. We've already flattened the curve once. The Coronavirus is being used for another purpose......Socialism,  Global Reset. Period. All Democrats on board.
105233	Receiving news about someone passing bc of Covid19 (more like, govt negligence) will never be easy. Ingat everyone! If may opportunity offered sa company or LGU for vaccines, pls grab it. Palakasan talaga ng immune system to. Get every protection you can get. Its real.
105693	Wait, but they do? We always said, get the jab if you want, don't force me. When is bodily autonomy acceptable to these people? Only when it's convenient for them?
106707	@DaveKeatley One thing is clear. This is no time to open borders, not until the Chinese Communist Party allows the Wuhan Institute of Virology to release ALL the information about the COVID19 in order to make vaccines fully functional. Right now they are not.
106902	Dear God,Please let this Covid-19 vaccine be the thing that'll wipe out ignorant and stupid people (because they're those who'll refuse to take the vaccine and then later get the virus and die). Amen.

106175	Indeed. Really happy US will donate vaccine to poorer countries where it's desperately needed. And my teenage daughter and I (both US citizens living in Thailand) would love to get vaccinated, but not possible so far. #taxedbutnotvaxxed
107451	My friend once asked me why am I so desperate for the vaccine?This is exactly why. A 20 year old with no medical history just passed away.... I can't afford that

105948	I‚Äôm so confused on why people care about what someone they‚Äôll never come into contact with is doing. Let him not take the vaccine or take it. The science on BOTH sides has relative pros and cons.This shaming shit is for weirdos and sheep.
107103	@anthonyfurey :  as you know, there is nothing scientific about this.Either we believe in the vaccines, or we don't.@erinotoole √°nd @fordnation are perpetuating unscientific fear.The new variant is more transmissible, but more mild = borders should remain open.
106410	@ProfAdeeba University of Oxford researchers have begun testing a COVID-19 vaccine in human volunteers in Oxford today. Around 1,110 people will take part in the trial, half receiving the vaccine and the other half (the control group) receiving a widely available meningitis vaccine.
105659	"@emmaogreen Vaccines are NOT 100% effective.MIllions in the U.S. REFUSE to take the vaccine.Kids under 16 aren't vaxxed yet. Kids spread the virus just like everyone else. There is no longer the ""virus"" but COVID-19 and its many mutations.So yeah, I'm still wearing a mask."
105569	Sure, they have a vaccine for the coronavirus, but you know what they'll never inocculate me against? Being 120% pure class üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
105929	@epoch_hollycene @BLM06892246 @trevormwills @h3h3productions Coronavirus isn‚Äôt new, it pretty much mutates constantly. This vaccine has been in the making since the first major SARS-Cov outbreak in the early 2000‚Äôs. The cervical cancer prevention vaccines and an mRNA vaccine are completely different.
106845	I don't understand why it's become so difficult in my area to be tested for coronavirus. Kinda lame. Proof of antibodies should equal vaxxed or a negative result.
107120	You are like this coronavirus for my heart, infected me badly..no medicines, no vaccine! I hope my future husband is reading this, pls come into my life asap and save me !
106810	The COVID-19 vaccine should be tested on @OfficialPDPNig members first . If they survive the vaccine is safe , if they don't NIGERIA  is safe.  Thank you all .
105632	‚ÄúThis is a good day for me and for my family. The vaccine will help protect me now, especially after my second shot. We will all still follow #COVID19 measures, but I think the vaccine is the most important solution to the pandemic. We will all feel a little safer today onwards‚Äù.
107008	Erm.....ugh..... this data..... nothing important is it? @MattHancock - just the amount of people who have died from the vaccine.....but this is a govt who don‚Äôt like to provide statistics in any shape or form no matter how many times they are asked! @SirGrahamBrady @JuliaHB1
106091	@shawnmicallef I know you know this:There has never been a successful vaccine for a coronavirus.Ever.
105976	@detroitnews Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
106405	@RealYeyoZa I‚Äôm seeing others saying there has never been a coronavirus vaccine, so there might never be one. Any truth to that?
105600	@newsmax We have these vaccinated folks saying, They hope the other folks who don't want to get this COVID-19 vaccine die. And that's never happened before with any of those other vaccines we have out there.

106050	Do we think that God has given us access to the vaccine first because he knows our leadership won't protect us?
107395	"""This is precious vaccine. We do not want to create any security risks,"" Julie Willems Van Dijk of @DHSWI said.""The less we talk about where the vaccine is, the more secure it will be."""
105964	@SamShaneKFBK @C_Mendonsa Sen. Wicker said there‚Äôs only one reason for countries to pursue gain of function. That‚Äôs nonsense. The US does it &amp; not all reasons are nefarious: Vaccine research, genetic research, etc. The common cold in fat is a coronavirus with no cure or vaccine.
107167	Don't be naive. So what if it is approved by FDA? It doesn't change the fact that the vaccine is not safe. Do not think that the government has your best interest in mind.
201509	omg i did the covid19 booster yesterday im not okay rn my arms hurt a lot like if someone is continuously punching my arm and I feel reeeeeaaaally lazy and tired
105879	No vaccine for me! They have reverse actions, flu shot got me the flu was sick for 3 weeks. If I get it I‚Äôll take the therapeutics.
106480	@POTUS What gives @Twitter @twittersupport ? Why allow all this constant misinformation regarding Covid-19 vaccinations??? It is an indisputable fact that vaccines CANNOT ensure that you don't get the mutating virus, same as the flu...so why allow all the lies?? F'ing disgusting...
105209	We might be getting the vaccines??? A big win. Please get them from Ramaphosa‚Äôs country and please adopt the system and protocols they have to acquire it.
105497	Same With COVID-19 Vaccines :-) They truly Work and they set us free to enjoy life again :-)  a mask is a small price to pay , for Freedom , Don't you Think ??
107660	@osquare78 @channelstv My brother everybody is not covid-19 vaccine compliant. It's not by force to take the vaccine. So if you deemed it fit to do so, fine no need insulting people who don't want to take it. It's a free world. Why It's so hard for some people to drive home their points without insults
107373	I am still scared to take the #coronavirus vaccine. My family and friends are taking #ivermectin and we have seen the power in my grandfather. He is cured from #covid! #ivermectinworks

If it is, do the intended beneficiaries have the capacity to store the vaccine?"
106487	This is how they will get around a mandatory vaccine. Cut funding from anyone the doesn‚Äôt require it üò°
107566	@RealKidPoker To research vaccines and treatments for all known viruses, now the coronavirus is a large family but rechearching and creating vaccines would've been paramount. And create tons of masks for doctors and stockpile them for when these things happen because we've got a mass shortage.
105214	"Oh nooo. Is canada just going to wait for #pandemic to spread? Until the ""magic"" vaccine that will take months? #cdnpoli"
106806	@MadFckingWitch @davidsmosspiggy Article pulls a few negative quotes from several researchers to paint a gloomy picture. The reality is 1) The odds of a viable vaccine are good, 2) No coronavirus until this one has been able to infect the lower lungs, so comparing to prev. CVs is unhelpful.
107534	But when it comes to vaccine distribution it is still unclear on equal distribution once health care workers done.  Make these in Usa in bulk and distribute as immunity only last less than 6 months @vivek_murthy
106619	It would be a real shame if all these political leaders and celebrities that are getting recorded taking the vaccine are actually getting an empty syringe to trick the masses....
106598	@coldo71369284 @HagemasterBeth @realDonaldTrump Same goes for the coronavirus; why do you think so many politicians that said the virus is a hoax but yet they are first in line to get the vaccine?  And why are so many non-believers wearing masks (most improperly or never cleaning it)...
106779	@glenzee79 @CNN @StCollinson (The first coronavirus vaccine in history, the vaccine being rolled out, is because of Trump admin, and was completed in 6 months)Orange man bad
105223	@aldatweets @ohdannyboy12 the vaccine does not prevent people from getting coronavirus or spreading it. (it does other things.) every single person being vaccinated (which I am btw) would not 100% wipe out coronavirus. these tweets are tiresome.
106603	Can someone explain why we keep calling it a #COVID19 #vaccine?? Vaccines provide IMMUNITY to a virus. These are shots to BOOST our immune system,  they do NOT make you immune!! I still think we should all get the shots, but I think we should be honest in what it does!
107087	I don‚Äôt know what they put In vaccines , but I thought they put the virus in them Coronavirus is common, it‚Äôs just the strain we look at , correct?Do the ppl that are being tested and have had a positive result also have had  the flu vaccine?
107505	@KurtBusch just heard it suggested on MSNBC that NASCAR drivers (and other athletes) get the Coronavirus vaccine to ramp up the trust of the skeptics in the country. Sounds good to me! Hope you are getting yours soon!!  ‚ù§Ô∏èü¶ã‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üèÅ
107214	How have they been testing the new coronavirus vaccines? Has anyone who has gotten the vaccine been exposed to the live virus or is the effectiveness all hypothetical?
106265	Every day of my life, senior citizens call me desperate to get the vaccine. I‚Äôve even had veterans call me. Seems to me that you would give these 40 shots to an American who actually loves our country not a terrorist. #comeonman

105350	@truth_seeker_85 @EASYMONEY75 The covid-19 virus  is Quickly running its course and going to disappear in the not-too-distant future, just as the SARS - 2 virus did. The only people interested in continuing this are the politicians the government and big Pharma. As with SARS 2 no vaccine is needed.
105501	Now you have my attention üòèSeriously though, if I was going to get a shot that would do nothing for me, there are much worse reasons than free beer.  I got 6 rounds of Anthrax vaccine in the Marines and usually had to come up with my own beer and entertainment...
107227	@CornerRadish @therealmissjo @jon_mumford1982 You give no reason, that's unhelpful.There is no cure for coronavirus-19, until a vaccine is developed.An apparently healthy can carry the virus for upto 27 days before symptoms show.During that incubation period an infected person infects others.Isolation is the only defense
107303	This will be great and extremely helpful with using up the extra vaccines Mississippi has due to rejections #SPRING21mcj2031/27
105322	@jitterbug212 I'm sorry. I'm at work. Trying to say that even the common cold (which is a coronavirus) has no vaccine. And testing would be an endless cycle.

105343	My mom just got her first #COVID19 #covidvaccine through @AusPublicHealth and the staff/volunteers were so incredibly nice and thoughtful throughout the whole process. Their warmth almost made standing in the icy rain bearable.
106107	@catturd2 Have they put these variants into the coronavirus vaccine? To keep it going around the world?
106644	@MeghanMcCain People just don‚Äôt understand how serious the coronavirus is until it hits their family. The question is why are we getting the vaccine? Trump created some of the problems. He didn‚Äôt wear a mask  for a long time. People need to stop criticizing you and do some research.
105419	"@Feldegast1 Flu is not caused by coronavirus famiy but influenza virus family.Other coronavirus can cause ""cold"" symptoms that are mild and therefore no need for vaccine.Each virus-vaccine dynamic is different depending on many factors. Many work great (polio/hepatitis) others not."
201764	Second Covid vaccine yesterday. No side effects. Feeling great. All teachers should be vaccinated before schools fully open. #vaccine #CovidVaccine #COVID19 #schoolsreopening
105660	Now that schools are closing for the year, one question is coming to mind. Are they going to require my kids to receive a COVID-19 vaccine before they're allowed back in? Ain't. Fucking. Happening!!!#Qanon
105499	@AKriesen @RichMuny @Yockle @GovMikeDeWine You'll never get rid of any Coronavirus. Keep taking those jabs, because now a third is coming and Fauci wants you blistered every 5 months. Logic days the jab isn't working!!
105320	@kylenabecker @newsmax The only 100% effective VACCINE against the Pandemic is to get rid of all the tyrants of the coronavirus #COVID and put them in permanent Quarantine in maximum security prisons.
106509	UNICEF asking for vaccine for countries like India,where have you got us Mr.Modi!The whole world is seeing how weak we are,why were you touting yourself as vaccine guru!
106524	@mofosyne @GVDBossche @WHO Why are three nursing homes in Devon all suffering from COVID19 residents and staff effective this week.  Nearly all have rec‚Äôs their first vaccine.  This is happening in other countries as well.
106773	@MontgomeryCoMD Here's the #COVID19 vaccine update for MoCo: There isn't any vaccine for you.  And because we're going to vaccinate people who work here, even if they don't live here, you might never get vaccinated.  LOL.
105952	exactly. what y‚Äôall gotta say now? it‚Äôs YOUR CHOICE but i HIGHLY recommend getting the vaccine not only to protect you but someone you love as well. be smart.
107536	Now everyone with the vaccine is a carrier.  Good job, libs, while Pelosi holds huge conference with no masks or distancing.  Hypocrites all the way!!!
105677	The vaccine doesn't work but the most important thing is that there is no virus cause it's never been isolated so no vaccine needed at all
106290	Instead of forcing people to get a random shot, how about we realize how corrupt our govt is that they would release a virus on the world simply because they hate Trump and love power. #coronavirus #CovidVaccine #chinavirus #DoNotComply #democraps #NotMyPresident #Trump2024
106843	I‚Äôve decided not to get my hair did or my nails done. I‚Äôm not dining out until #Colorado is where scientists tells us we need to be with testing (152/100K), tracing etc. A vaccine is at least 1 year away. Please #StayHome #DoYourPartCo #COVID19 @GovofCO
106521	@VinGuptaMD I'd like to know (esp in respect to the immune system), approx number of those who died of covid19 had not had a flu shot in the autumn. Pneumonia vaccines, esp for the elderly? Flu shots come out in September now, and even w/out Covid in them, they help me resist flu
105473	Totally agreed. Testing is the only way out! The WHO has said that even previous infection wont protect you from reinfection, which means even if a vaccine comes, it may only prevent serious infections and not an infection itself.
105816	If the #Government has such faith in these vaccines, why don't they take it first?  #askingforafriend #covid #vaccine #Pfizer #lawthelpus
107210	@AliciaVPP @richardzussman The ONLY oeople in BC who can not get the COVID19 vaccine are;Children under 5 years old.  And that may change very soon, sndPeople who have VALID MEDICAL reasons.Otherwise, there is not a person in this province, or Canada who wants a vaccine who can not access the vaccine
107280	There was always going to be a Christmas lockdown, if you didn't see it coming then bleh. Governments still working on case numbers not deaths. This will continue until you realise what is actually happening. If vaccines don't stop lockdowns what will ? #Covid_19 #COVID19
106180	Anti-Vaxxers think a Flu Shot will give your child Autism... but are lining up right now to give their whole family the COVID-19 vaccine if Trump endorses it.I'm starting to think their thought process isn't based on science... or research... or sense.
107416	CORONAVIRUS Pandemic at the Level  World and in my National Country and I think I have a positive result regarding a very feasible cure and Vaccine immediately to start fighting the Sar Cov -2 virusunfortunately in our COUNTRY President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador does not 2/6
105912	The kicker is that they haven't actually isolated any virus. So what's this vaccine supposed to do exactly? @sjgarvey
105784	Who‚Äôs actually gonna have the coronavirus vaccine if they ever find one? I‚Äôd be very worried about what they‚Äôre actually putting in that shit
107052	What is really in the jab that we all must have it even though we don't need it? Is it sterilisation, a cull, or just a psyop to bring in digital ID cards and social credit?
107510	@MattHancock the whole country is laughing at you. Most don't believe your virus lies, the rest just think you are incompetent. And we have news for you... nobody is going to abide by any restrictions currently or upcoming and we are certainly not being vaxxed #SackMattHancock
106494	@First_class18 @CAgovernor @GavinNewsom @CAPublicHealth @CHHSAgency @Cal_OES @CAStateParks @CalVolunteers @ListosCA COVID-19 mutates rapidly, if there is a vaccine, it only works for short terms. COVID19 isn't going away easily but changes in our behavior can prevent it or manage it if we have it. Other countries can do it...why not the US, too much freedom, opinion, laziness or stupidity?
105657	@Spacedementia87 @davidwhitaker40 @mountainecology @10DowningStreet 1) Do you genuinely believe 100,000 people signed up as volunteers? 2) it usually takes 12-15 years minimum to get a vaccine approved?3) no institute has found a coronavirus vaccine in 20/25 years yet we do in 6 months? Sorry it‚Äôs 98.54% in the U.K. think that‚Äôs high enough
106383	How did healthy, under-65, non-healthcare-workers family got COVID-19 vaccine so soon? They got a tip and used it. Didn't contact any compromised or elderly people or healthcare workers in their family, friend group, neighborhood, kids school.
107071	@NBCLX My great grandma in Newburgh NY got the vaccine, fell broke her hip, and contracted coronavirus/ COVID19 at the physical therapy clinic. YOU TELL ME HOW EFFECTIVE THIS VACCINE IS WHEN THE POEPLE AROUND ME ARE STILL GETTING BADLY SICK üíî
105464	What q shame this this, meanwhile countries around the world have noneThis reminds me like the gun issue, when there is a mass shooting like at a school, outrage abound and after a month everyone forgets and carry on, vaccines are like a news cycle, human behaviour is weird
107117	Has there been any forgery of the COVID-19 vaccine cards? Or is that not an issue yet as they're not yet widely the permission slip back into normal activities?
105665	All those who died of Covid got the flu vaccine this year. Is it because they had compromised immune systems?Or is it something more sinister? All nursing home patients get vaccinated. Why did 5 Dem govs keep Covid patients in nursing homes? ü§î#Plandemic #ArrestBillGates
106616	It's 2021 there is a vaccine for coronavirus, DeSantis is impeached, and an executive order is signed to replace the mile to mandatory participation in Kanye's New Workout Plan
107601	@CollignonPeter In Italy I learn about twenty, thirty and forty year olds who lose their lives due to covid19. I would really like to know if the disease is really cured as they say or if it is fatal. I am not interested in ideologies. The only way to save is the vaccine yes or no?

107349	Over the last few months, if asked whether I would receive a coronavirus vaccine, my reaction has been yes. But then, I've thought...well, that depends. It depends on what we hear about this vaccine, the approval process, etc. News like this is good to see.
106423	@XylariaVG purposefully inject this man with coronavirus, and tell him he can only get the vaccine if he delivers on these promises
107414	"@thehill ""...the Democrats don't want a vaccine either! They want Americans to die from the Coronavirus!! Not like me, when I ignored it for months, and called it a Democra... oh shit, forget that!"""
201625	All well-informed people know that this is possible - significant protection only *starts* 12 days after the first vaccine dose. The well-known 95% effective rate is only some time after the *second* dose. My reaction to this and news of a few allergic reactions: who cares?
106307	My only regret about getting 2nd COVID-19 vaccine shot is I went there a lil early, so instead of having an excuse to get a nice sandwich for lunch at a place I like near there, I got a dynamite omelet earlier instead.Also I‚Äôm not yet functioning very well as a 5G cell tower.
107132	If the vaccine works then those the want to be protect it OK and my refusal should not matter because those that worried are safe. does this answer your question
105435	So only two outcomes from #COVID19 1Vaccine 2You're antibody test proves your body can fight the virus. Going out is a risk we cant gamble with, the vaccine is risk I will not be so comfortable with accepting. Question everything. #coronavirus
201636	@shiftms Rest,rest and more rest!!! My fatigue has been pretty extreme the last couple of days! And if I didn‚Äôt have to get my 1st Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow, I would stay in bed all day! But I am so fortunate to be able to get this vaccine I will crawl to the Doctors office to get it!
106884	@steveubl When you actually come up with a vaccine for the common cold (which is a coronavirus) maybe I'll possibly slightly remotely consider getting a cv-19 vaccine
201541	I just got my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine today at State Farm Stadium. They have an excellent system working there. Hurray!!! üéäüéâüíâ
105939	@charliekirk11 Anti vaccine a-holes are going to be why we don‚Äôt beat COVID-19 when we currently have the resources to do so.
105787	@AaronBosterMD @YouTube Thank you for posting. I will be telling my doctors when I get vaccinated, but are there projects ongoing to track MS patients and COVID-19 or vaccines? I'm signed up with Narcoms study, will have my 2nd yearly follow up in 3 months. Any others we should look for?
105886	So, basically, the jab might not actually do much except protect people who don't need protecting and Covid is mainly affecting people with preexisting conditions, like we've known for 18 months now. If this is true then many people are going to jail for a ¬£1 trillion fraud
105265	Not surprising. He's in with Gates' NWO POPULATION CONTROL VACCINE SCAM. Killing people like the elderly in the Nursing homes is  in their wheelhouse
106766	What will parents do if the government mandates the COVID-19 vaccine for children returning to school.  I bet it would create the biggest uproar in history.  Nearly 5000 people have DIED after taking this vaccine.  One kid does and it is game over.
107409	@larssivertsen And he‚Äôs been getting into anti-vaccine David Icke, 5g coronavirus conspiracy nonsense recently, so he‚Äôs seemingly only getting less intelligent
105273	My mom received the vaccine the day it became available in Virginia. She‚Äôs a respiratory therapist. Even as a teacher, I don‚Äôt need this vaccine to do my job at the moment.
107550	people would probably take a vaccine for the wuhan virus yet not for the flu. People are so so strange
105881	@oOoMzPiinkoOo @VLEXXXGALINDO That‚Äôs a very wrong and dangerous mentality. The coronavirus, yes has been around for awhile but the particular strain HAS NOT. Hence why there is no vaccine or cure for it, therefore we MUST take precautions and STAY home to prevent further spread. Stop underestimating it.
107564	This virus is spreading way too rapidly. Can anyone reply to this tweet with any databases on the infection? #coronavirus #coronavaccine
107579	@realDonaldTrump I wasn‚Äôt allowed to say anything until today, but it's now done so.... I volunteered for the test phase of COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer. This vaccine is the one that has been developed in Russia. It is administered in 6 different stages and I received my first...
107272	@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Somebody needs to tell Rand Paul to take a flying leap.  He isn't a doctor, he isn't a scientist so he has no business telling people not wear masks if they've had Covid-19 or if you had the vaccine.  Let the doctors and scientist do their job. They don't try and do yours
107661	2 weeks after the election, Moderna announces their vaccine is 95% effective. How long did they know? How long did they delay the announcement to hurt @realDonaldTrump just like Pfizer? I bet Tony Fauci knows. These are his pals. Proof that Big Pharma doesn't care about YOU.
201716	148,000 Nigerians have so far received their second dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. ‚Äî @drfaisalshuaib (June 3, 2021)
106222	@ianbrown The vaccines for various coronavirus types such as seasonal flu and CV19 are similar. Never any evidence or reason to think that they can cause infertility.
105868	@discipleheart1 It's not what I think it's what I know. This is not a fully approved vaccine, we are going through phase 2 and 3 using the American population. As they push the 'safe' vaccine relentlessly on doctor radio in the same breath they tell us they know very little about covid19
106014	#Unvaccinated #vaccine #vaccinated #VaccinePassports #Covid_19 #coronavirus #VaccineMandate This is why- because the 2 shot vaccine did its job- (people can't think for themselves- they will do what they are told) this is a side effect from the vaccine #VaccineSideEffects
105584	@AdamBode4 @MsMelChen @PeterDrew There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine in 50+ years of research specifically because they mutate so much--using non-sterilizing treatments in mass only drives mutants thru selective pressure and will lead to immune escape.  Vax the elderly/immune compromised.
106999	This is what #JoeBiden doesn't say about the vaccine....that people are still getting the #coronavirus even after getting the vaccine.
201512	Sorry my body is a temple of the Lord's..it is not mine...Thus taking a #vaccine goes against my #Christian values...I also can't believe or spread a lielike covid and it's numbers#wakeup#WakeUpAmerica
107432	@RichmondWahoo @diogeron @NewsHour James covid-19 IS SARS-COV-2. It was called that bc it is similar (not the same) to SARS-COV. It's a new virus that belongs to the coronavirus fam. The vaccines work so well bc they were created using existing techniques for covid-19. You take YOUR misinformation out of here.
106333	absolutely blows my mind that there are people in my family who are proud about deciding not to get the covid-19 vaccine
107320	What we need is a vaccine against COVID-19 cause we are going to be living with this shit. And the sad thing is everyone is going to get this shit one way or the other sighs ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

106187	I live in PA; am 74.  My grandchildren who attend school in person, live with us. My husband is 77.  He works outside the home. we have no idea when we will get the vaccine.  Communication from health services is sorely lacking.  Friends all over the country have received theirs!
106003	No way is this clown getting that vaccine. They're trying really hard to convince us these vaccines are safe. I've never seen him with a mask on. Is it really even  him? And why turn off the replies?

106206	@commonsnspoli @CNN Covid 19, like any other coronavirus can never go away until herd immunity achieved. Period. That‚Äôs it. Please educate yourself. No deadly virus has ever gone away without herd immunity and/or a vaccine, or drastic mutation to bring less deadly.
105207	Vaccines are helping us all get our lives back, but I've seen all sorts of misinformation since they've become available. Confronting fear with facts is how we overcome vaccine hesitancy. Dr. Walensky has the answers to your questions about the COVID vaccine ‚¨á

106224	Pretty much this. Considering recent finds, I'm pretty optimistic on a coronavirus vaccine. That said, I don't think it'll be very effective, we'll probably need multiple doses, and I'm not sure everyone will be able to get one (children or the old may have immune issues).
201709	I don‚Äôt feel well, my upper arm is very sore and hot. I have a neck-ache and headache, taken some paracetamol. #covid19 #vaccine

106021	Not unless there is a variant that both enjoys heat and is impervious to the vaccine.Are we still listenng to Imperial? And what figure did they quote?
105595	Kind of figured that the project would be delayed. They're still using the old Macy's as a central vaccine/testing site in the city. Nothing's going to happen until they get a new, permanent solution to those needs.

107070	@Aflame4Truth So just let the elderly die if COVID-19 than risk a probably safe vaccine. You apparently don‚Äôt have an over 70 loved one.  In the over 5% mortality crowd the benefits far outweigh any known risks. Decisions out of fear rarely work out well. Don‚Äôt give it to under 40 crowd.
107351	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19 and the May 4 pledging conference must be a success. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.

106612	@toxdom I can't think of any coronavirus vaccines, but there may be some. However, an antibody is super specific. If you tested another coronavirus vaccine against CV-19, it would not be able to help show efficacy. It's like having 2 gold keys, each will only fit the lock it belongs to.

We are all aware it is the covid 19 and that the vaccine was done quickly because they had the laywork already done for the coronavirus.  Not because the orange baffoon did anything.
105277	On day one of the #MorrisonLockdown, Victoria does itself proud with amazing testing numbers!And vaccination numbers are up, too! Go you beauty, because this is how we not just trample the virus, but stamp it out! If you can, please organise your jab.#COVID19Vic #COVID19Aus
105408	Ndp on #cp24 telling everyone this new variant is extremely contagious and deadly .... same channel , doctors telling us ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know enough‚Äù lockdown for Xmas people. How‚Äôs that vaccine working out for ya ? #covid19
201675	Guess who just booked the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine??!!! Tomorrow at 9:30 ... I'm getting the shot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
107518	@ChuckCallesto I feel we will be forced to take the Covid-19 vaccine for everyone‚Äôs benefit just like we are being forced to wear masks for everyone‚Äôs benefit.
105426	There have been many attempts to make viral vaccines in the past that ended in utter failure, which is why we did not have a coronavirus vaccine in 2020.  In the 1960's, scientists attempted to make an RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) vaccine for infants.
107202	@SiberiaCat3 @Moonie74786922 @centexgrunt @Kelly_K_77 @SquirrelOS @lavern_spicer Not a bot - just reality. Covid-19 will not disappear, even with 100% vaccinations. Plus, no way will 100% be global, and the vaxxed catch/carry. Learning to live with endemic is possible. Figuring out how isn‚Äôt being openly discussed. Fearing the pandemic is not productive.
107127	@sechsneuneins @FaheemYounus So why has this methodology not been applied to a vaccine for treating AIDS ,SARS, MERS all viruses,  as deadly, if these hv been proven safe in less then 12 months of testing? AIDS been around 40 years , SARS 19. Covid19, 1 year &amp; there is a fix using a method not deployed b4.
107209	@patriotchick4 @knoone413 @AmirAminiMD This was a, get this, NOVEL coronavirus. There was no way to fight it because it is not the same strain as similar viruses. It is A coronavirus. Not SARS-CoV-2. Which is also why new tests had to be made and there's no vaccine.
105957	@TheM_L_G @ACiderDrink There is a very real drawback of socialized medicine countries they havent made any progress on a vaccine despite having earlier strains of the coronavirus sars being the prominent one which happened over 15 years ago
106092	@EmeraldRobinson whats it like lying about a Virus (COVID19) that has killed 700k Americans, and Lying about the Vaccine,, JUST SO YOU GET A PAY CHECK&lt; whats it like to be the FACE in the Dictionary next to the word Deplorable
106789	@newscomauHQ @mikepompeo How does a virus get from a #WuhanLab to being inside a human? #vaccines. The people of #china were given mandatory vaccines JUST before this all broke out.

105821	No really, I give up. I have been fighting to get the world to buy Prevnar and Pneumovax and HPV shots for a decade, and no one in #cdnpoli knew who the F Gavi or @ShotAtLife wasNow suddenly #covid19 comes along and you all know how vaccines get made, ordered and bought
201635	Back from my first Saturday evening out in ages. OK, I took Dad to the health centre for his first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, but it still counts.....
105390	Just because we've got a really good vaccine against polio doesn't mean the same thing will work with coronavirus, because it's so different.
106730	the vaccine against coronavirus is a fraud humanity will have to live with this virus what humanity needs and treatment to not die because with vaccine or without vaccine humanity is dying.
106963	The problem is people come around to wanting the vaccine only AFTER they get sick! Be smart, people! Get it now!!
105289	Morning after #COVID19  vaccine update:- My arm is hecka sore. Much like after the flu shot, I won't be lifting my arm up today.- My brain is foggy and I'm pretty tired. Going up the stairs is tiring and talking extensively is too.
105253	@99freemind @HRHospital There has never been a coronavirus vaccine that ever worked.  Suddenly we are sold two vaccines will save the world.
106043	I actually find nothing wrong with this. Dia cuma utamakan je, like they utamakan front liner. Kita punya turn dpt vaccine memang lambat lagi pun üòÇIn fact, these people helped SO SO SO many lives before. Dont you think they deserve it?
107361	@msnbc has made it abundantly clear. They do not care at all about people who die from taking the vaccine. @msnbc doesn't employ a single person who values human life.  What terrible human beings.
106861	@KobieThatcher @ShazzaCook @deanandy477 @NSWHealth ... and for the Nay sayer, coronavirus Arte known for not having a vaccine because we never found one against the common cold, however, why not now, why not since our research are becoming worldwide, why not now since it is our primarily focus?
107568	This whole thing, all of it, COVID, Vaccines, Republicans, Election, it is all one big cluster f‚Äôck. I‚Äôm going to my corner of the world, done with it all, won‚Äôt watch news, I‚Äôm going to be one of those people who don‚Äôt know shit and are happy as can be. Republicans r a waste....
201526	The jab for #COVID19 is amazing but I‚Äôve had this 24 hour sickness bug for the last 18 hours and don‚Äôt understand why we don‚Äôt have a jab for this! I feel awful!
107344	Random Saturday thought-it‚Äôs amazing to think we got a Covid19 vaccine developed, trialled and partially deployed quicker than the time it took Apple to figure out how to adapt Face ID so that we could unlock our phones whilst masked up ü§îü§îü§î#GetVaccinated
105705	COVID-19 is realMost will develop mild to no symptoms.However, those it does kill, it kills rather quicklyBeing obese is high risk for hospitalization and/or death.The vaccine is probably a good idea for such folks.
106905	@RitaLisaPatton @56Symons @JustinTrudeau @jacindaardern You are either a bot or a very stupid person.  There has never been a vaccine for a.coronavirus ever!  This is a flu bug with a 99.6% recovery rate.  Never a vaccine for SARS or H1N1, and we survived.  You take this vaccine and you will be in a graveyard.
107394	JKL the Kagwe Dilemma. @KoinangeJeff  @citizentvkenya  , In his own words, 'how is the Kenyan vaccine going to work? and how did they know that am going to get covid19? Ama unapewa vaccine na unatumwa penye corona iko?' Just asking.
107369	Feel like a train wreck after receiving my first Pfizer vaccine yesterday. Hopefully, these symptoms will subside quickly and won't be as bad the second time around! Just made me realise how much worse it may be actually contracting Covid19! #happilyvaccinated
106432	Just tell them the vaccine is weak ... Because I took the shot and the vaccine is weak .... You know how hArd it's to work now after COVID-19 ... My body feels like it's 50 I'm 27...I need a booster shot or new shots treatment .. cause it  weak ..it slow your thoughts down dat it
106163	Yeah but will those children be sterile or get cancer  autism, schizophrenia or autoimmune disease? This is a clinical trial on humans and now their offspring. There is no liability for the pharmaceutical companies and the vaccines aren't FDA approved. Still labeled experimental
105653	@IMHOjustsaying @SysOptSpeMike @BrianAckerman80 @POTUS Flu vaccines are required around the world? You may say why choose the flu vaccine, well that is because it is a yearly shot because the virus mutates, the same as the SARSCoV2 virus which is just a coronavirus.
201767	Super excited and relieved to be getting my first COVID-19 vaccine today. One down one more to go in three weeks. üíâ https://t.co/C7cvd0oOTX
105263	@theheraldsun Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
105232	Bottom line is, just get the fucking vaccine already so we can get this shit over with.  The QUICKER we can get back to NORMAL, the BETTER!This is honestly QUITE tiresome... üò†#COVID19 #Delta
107548	Plus I bet that when we do get a vaccine for Covid-19 the Anti-Vaxxers will be fighting the school districts if it‚Äôs required.

107560	what did y‚Äôall think would happen with the vaccine? it‚Äôs the same as a flu vaccine, you‚Äôll still catch the virus, it just won‚Äôt affect you as bad as it would without it.

107477	#COVID„Éº19 Anyone with half-a-brain - and any slither of regard for fellow citizens, who may be in high-risk groups and especially vulnerable to the virus - should stop moaning about having to wear face masks etc, and GROW UP, ffs!An effective vaccine is the ONLY way forward

106312	@realTuckFrumper I don't believe #IvapidIvanka @IvankaTrump will ACTUALLY get the Coronavirus vaccine.  Don't believe those LIARS about ANYTHING.  I'd bet $$$ it will be sterile saline she gets injected with - DON'T BUY their BS!
105694	#lockdown Eventually, this bug will likely become endemic in the population and be a scourge for years until we develop a vaccine and eliminate it. This, of course, is if the anti-vaxers cooperate like they have NOT with measles. #COVID19

105742	@MickyArison Are you considering that people who already had covid get the vaccine too ? Are you aware the damage it does to the heart if you were already infected with Coronavirus  ?Or are you just droning the chant ?
106300	@UPP_Polls I'm worried that the normal flu vaccine is going to be targeted by antivaxxers when fall comes around, probably with claims that the coronavirus is in it or something.It's only going to get worse when the actual COVID-19 vaccines becomes viable.
106054	Bill gates has a patent on coronavirus. So all the research being done and any vaccine created, he will get royalty payments on. @RoninSamTripoli @luisjgomez @lexfridman @NickHintonn @HighersideChats @tconspiracyguys @daylyt30 @joerogan @TimJDillon
106553	Will the vaccine give you any protection? If you look at the data you would have to say yes. If you then ask will the vaccine keep you from getting the coronavirus? Well you would have to say no.
107527	@mjean2 An effective vaccine will protect someone who receives it by lowering the chance of getting COVID-19 if the person encounters the coronavirus. More important is whether the vaccine prevents serious illness, hospitalization and death.
201518	WELL, I am microchipped jk lol but today I was fortunate enough to get the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 vaccineI believe and trust science. In the spirit of full transparency and honesty I will happily answer questions and post if I develop any side effects etc https://t.co/cVc2tnRZsT

106168	This is actually investing advice now. So um... Even though the #SARSCoV2 vaccines from all these vaccine companies and shitty, you should invest in all these vaccine companies in the long term.COVID-19 causes immune amnesia.
106590	Better to go an vaccinated them. They will never maintain Covid appropriate behavior. My domestic help just took a Covid vaccine after so much of persuading. All her slum walas said you will die if you take vaccine.
106321	I will never get over how people are in public not wearing masks and planning parties and going to bars when coronavirus is still a thing and there is no vaccine and not enough testing.
107434	What's the point of the vaccine then if masks are needed? If symptoms show then the vaccine has failed.
106785	@thereds8 I'm a BIG vax supporter but, there is no vaccine ever going to be available for a 'coronavirus'. Our immune system will only build antibodies against it, for, on average, 6 mths.
106332	@SoCalValleyGal @ChytilTonia @charliekirk11 False equivalency when there is testing, vaccine, and an immunity pool to the flu. Look at another Coronavirus mutation like MERS or SARS.
105689	@bridgebum826 @sarahbeth345 I think there actually is a coronavirus vaccine for pets. My dogs haven't received it. They also didn't catch COVID from us when we had it.
105293	@Neoavatara Human beings just do not develop long term immunity to coronaviruses.  No mammals do.  Even canine coronavirus vaccine must be given every year.
107017	Good for Dr. Tedros! #Africa will not be a testing ground for #COVID19 vaccine. Human beings will be treated like human beings, wherever they are. üëèüëèüëè
106745	@stefaniangelise Yeah no I agree I don‚Äôt get it either, all those vaccines aren‚Äôt permanent either. The coronavirus has been around for a long time. There are different versions of it and this one is just the easiest spreading. I never got them until the army forced me on deployment to get them
106157	@UgimaKenya Maghufuli is right, it will be a long time before a valid vaccine is found. This means that herd immunity is the way to go presently. Western world covid19 template cant work in African economies. Something is wrong and we are stupid not to call out our inept president
201610	@LadyVelvet_HFQ I'm fully #vaccinated! on 17th Sep '21. 2nd Dose with #COVISHIELD #AstraZeneca Successfully completed the schedule of all doses of COVID-19 vaccine.

106777	Why do some ppl expect a NEW vaccine for a NOVEL (uh, new - never been seen before, figuring out how to treat as we go) Coronavirus to be 100% effective on 1st release?  95% efficacy is pretty damn good. This is a HR and ppl are throwing the ball back on the field. *smh* ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§î
201648	I was able to get a COVID-19 vaccine appointment for my dad after waiting TWO hours for the confirmation email, because the site was so overwhelmed. My mom, also a 65+ high-risk stroke/diabetes patient, won her vaccine appointment through a LOTTERY. It shouldn't be this way.
106236	@POTUS don't force all Americans to get vaccine when available.  My body my choice I WILL NOT GET CV IMMUNIZATION.
105766	@davestwittylife They will keep moving the goalposts until November 5. If there is a Covid-19 vaccine in the meantime (very unlikely in my non-medically trained opinion), it will only be 50% effective at best, and will have very troublesome side effects, which they might not tell you about.
107099	And they can‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt take the shot,Vaccines don‚Äôt do what their telling us it does, stop trying to kill us
201770	I had the vaccine for #COVID19 today.  I had the JJ.  I still feel nervous.  Like waking up from a nightmare.  I am glad it is over but still stress for having it.
106203	@nick_ramsey Because the big wave is going to hit in 3 4 5 and 6 weeks and the coronavirus will come back next year cyclically by November 20/20 we need a coronavirus vaccine
201558	No hesitation booking my COVID-19 booster vaccine after the booking went live today, thanks to @Leic_hospital #GetVaccinated
106319	@globalnews Definitely not. However, I do hope all the blind conformists and unthinking sheeple will do so in order to give them a false sense of safety and security, so the rest of us can get our lives back. #Covid_19 #COVID19 #EndTheLockdowns #vaccine
106142	@AndreiManko It‚Äôs been warned about since day one. Hasn‚Äôt anyone stopped to even consider for a second why we haven‚Äôt ever had a coronavirus vaccine? Like, ever? There has always clearly been a market for one.
106978	@CDCgov Does the old COVID-19 vaccine work on new virus? Does it stop the spread or just lesson the symptoms? (Asking for a friend, please don‚Äôt ban me)
105242	@Gekotweets @Ayaanle_bdi Are you implying Coronavirus is god's revenge on the French for banning Hijab?
106909	@realDonaldTrump @GavinNewsom Perhaps in a year to 18 months there may be a vaccine to stop the spread.  One for the coronavirus as well.
106892	Coronavirus vaccines are free of charge. The NHS will never ask for payment or for your bank details. Be alert to vaccine fraud. #coronavirusfrauds
107244	I believe she has done a great job,her plan was to delay an all at once rush to avoid overloading the health care system which sheaccomplished but Sorry folks the reality is there are limits. Ex. what if there is no vaccine? Do we stay inside forever? never have surgeries?
106550	I wasn‚Äôt too sure about getting the vaccine, then Boris Johnson said he is getting it. He‚Äôs so trustworthy and has done a great job since becoming PM, that‚Äôs my mind made up, I will definitely be getting it too. Said nobody ever.
106177	Tested positive for COVID-19 , my symptoms are non existent. I was sick for a day or two. I think the fact that I took the vaccine has an influence in how I currently feel. I'm actually shocked.
106936	bullshit. the vaccine is a preventative measure, not something that is going to kill a child. before saying that kids shouldn‚Äôt get the vaccine, have you asked them about it? it‚Äôs their life, their choice. ones who want to get it, can get it. let them live their lives in peace
106083	You hear that @GOP, @GOPChairwoman McDaniel, and @realDonaldTrump the #CODVID19 will not disappear like magic. Unless we have a vaccine available so this virus is going to be around for awhile.
106215	For those of you who don't know. Covid 19 is being labeled a strain of the Coronavirus. Coronavirus is the common cold. Covid 19 has NEVER been isolated as a new strain. How can you make a vaccine for a virus that has NEVER been Isolated? You can't. Get It yet?
106724	@Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Vaccine progress is good news.  However it is not useful information for how Covid-19 is being managed nationally as of today, or as of the previous 180 days , or as of the next 180days.  153k in death climbing to 300k more before the year is out.  ‚ÄúGREAT JOB NOT‚Äù Mr Puppet.

105250	Actually, flu vaccine upgraded annually.  Already Coronavirus vaccines on the market for pets and has been for DECADES.  Different strain just like influenza.  Flu vaccine comes out ahead of the season every single year. How are experts now saying January rollout not possible?
105813	And just so everybody is clear, getting the vaccine DOES NOT make you immune to getting Covid. What it does do is vastly decrease your chances of dying if you do contract the virus.
107419	There is no proof that this is even slowing Covid. It may be speeding it up. If the vaccine helps then why were the most covid-19 deaths in children, recorded over the last five weeks? If the vaccine is a vaccine then why are more children infected? Kids did not get sick in 2020.
105237	It‚Äôs easy. All those sitting around complaining they can‚Äôt get vaccinated are just being lazy. Don‚Äôt be lazy, go, get vaccine and save your own life.
105418	@BishopJakes This humans would have to test negative for covid-19 first, if not my house is just perfectly fine, we'll most likely get together when there is a vaccine. #Social_Distancing #StayHome
107410	@NoblePhares Covid-19 isn‚Äôt unknown, and there is actually a vaccine for it, and it‚Äôs free, and it works.. just take the damn vaccine
106577	Wow, just like Trump called it... the Wuhan, China Virus. It‚Äôs called covid19 because they already had a name planned for its purpose- the vaccine!
105797	To say I'm scared is an understatement. I'm still waiting for my vaccination schedule together with my fellow doctors &amp; nurses in Makati. Waiting for DOH to release how much vaccine will be allocated. So waiting game right now esp if private sector frontliners non hospital based

105274	You are absolutely 100% correct because when you get Covid you have more antibodies then when you get the vaccine. You are so right!!!

105226	I am vegan.  COVID19 vaccines are not vegan or cruelty free.  I don't want to have the vaccine for this reason. #TheOnlyWayIsVegan
106195	This is my story guys. Feel free to share yours. Maybe, just maybe, someone who is reluctant to vaxx will read it and decide they dont wanna go through what you went through and go get jabbed
106377	@dwallacewells I am triple vaxxed, but don't get why we don't lock down unless and until we reach a larger vaxxed percentage. Japan has 90% and pretty much no coronavirus deaths. We still have 1200+/day. If the endemic strategy is to succeed, we need more vaccinated ppl.
107088	@CBCAlerts ‚ÄúDoctors are worried that coronavirus may end up being like influenza, which requires a new vaccine every year both because the circulating strains mutate fast and because immunity from the vaccine wears off quickly.‚Äù
106595	@dspondike @BretWeinstein The question is how well those so-called ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù actually work. Because they do not deliver ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù, the definition of ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù was recently revised to a risk/benefit ratio‚Äîwithout acknowledging COVID-19 ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù-related injury and death.
105472	I'm so going to enjoy rubbing this in the face of these Nigerian liberals. They called us all sorts for questioning the safety of their precious vaccines. Oya see am nau.And this will likely be the very tip of the iceberg.Mandating experimental drugs is stupid.

105728	@TradeEuropa Panic it's bad but we should preper to situation like in Wuhan it's now. Just to time vaccine in hospitals. China made this panic bcz ppl send so many movies with dead bodys, u can count this deadth cases &amp; thers numbers are bigger then China they give us in information.
105962	@Maselli_Andrea @Forbes Yea, just showing how stupid all of this is! People are wishing death on the other people who don't want to get this COVID-19 vaccine. And we never had people acting like this back in the day when other people didn't want to get any of those other vaccines we have out there.
106017	While I do not wish COVID-19 on any one or their loved ones but (you knew this was coming) if more are to get sick or die it would be ok with me because those without masks and vaccines provide those openings for the virus!

105667	@olives4fun @stltoday No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved, it doesn‚Äôt operate like a vaccine, it‚Äôs experimental and not fully tested. Every attempt at a vaccine against any coronavirus has made subsequent infection worse. There are effective treatments available.
105963	Dad got the COVID-19 vaccine today and mom gets it Monday!! I‚Äôm so excited for them and also a little jealous lol shoutout to my two favorite doctors üíú
105950	@GBNEWS Do you think it's weird how no world leaders not even the @WHO came out 2 years ago at the start of the pandemic and said take Vitamin D, take Vitamin C and take Zinc, do exercise and get sunshine? They never told us how to prevent getting #COVID19 they just said #vaccineswork
106983	@susan46775136 @kissandmakeupuk @dwilliam9940 It's not a vaccines, it's actually gene editing,permanently changing human DNA. New human species is the result. This has killed all tests animals it was tested on within 12 months after contact with a wild coronavirus. Time bomb ticking in jabbed population.
107418	Let‚Äôs get this clear, just because you get a flu jab does not make you completely immune to flu. So think, a half #coronavirus immune jab will not prevent getting it, so please have a brain, wear a mask&amp;wash your hands. Stay within your bubble &amp;home. @BorisJohnson @MattHancock
107042	if you haven't, please get vaccinated so we can go back to normal and all these people (including) won't be dying of a disease we already have the MF'ing vaccine for Just do it, you're wasting all of our lives now. Are we gonna spread this out another decade?
107238	If this is the case then why will I need to declare my vaccine status (with a piece of paper or app) to get into a pub? What next?  I had my hemarroids done before I can sit down anywhere?
107074	They vaccine will have aborted fetus cells in it, ipso facto, religious exception should be honored.  We are Americans not cattle
107583	@BBCBreaking I don‚Äôt get how they can say the so called vaccine will defeat this virus because coronavirus can‚Äôt be cured and will always mutate, also what about the Brazilian and South African strain, the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work with them.
107081	"Dr. Chaitra Ujjani: ""A lot of our patients have suffered in isolation and fear, and they're not sure they're going to get back to a normal life,"" ""So every oncologist is interested to see how their patients will respond to the vaccine.""@SeattleCCA"
105984	The üá¨üáß fully supports @antonioguterres and the vital @UN work fighting #coronavirus. Today we discussed the need for a coordinated global response to reinforce the most vulnerable countries, accelerating the search for a vaccine &amp; bringing countries together to defeat this virus.
105863	A vaccine for coronavirus is coming.  But will it be ready, or not?  Trump has become obsessed with launching a vaccine, thinking it‚Äôs his best hope for reelection.  New polling shows voters seriously skeptical of the  remedy and the rush.
106131	‚ñ∂Ô∏èFull lockdown until we have a vaccine...OK‚ñ∂Ô∏èLive under authoritarian rule (but not full lockdown)       until we have a vaccine...OK‚ñ∂Ô∏èVaccine may only be 70% effective...OK‚ñ∂Ô∏èVaccine may only be 50% effective...WTF?!Do you not see what is happening?????????????
107279	@AyinAzirinee Depends how it‚Äôs ‚Äòpinched‚Äô. The needle (for COVID-19 vaccines) should go into the muscle, so some pinching is ok but not till the needle only enters the fat layer. Usually pinching is not needed for intramuscular injections. Other vaccines might be different
106193	BUT, BLM/Antifa anarchy ‚Äògatherings‚Äô are acceptable. Wake up America!They don‚Äôt wear masks because they know something they are not sharing with us? Fear is used to control, like demand you wear masks and stay inside.Bull!The only way forward is herd immunity,not deadly vaccines!
107479	@Browney86195309 As per the NHS website, having the vaccine gives you long lasting protection again Covid -19.  There is however still a small chance you can get or spread coronavirus, even if you have the vaccine.  P&amp;O Cruises are determined to protect the health of all guests and crew on board.
201572	@calico_heart_ My heart is failing and I have Stage 4 prostate cancer. No one wants to tell me how long I will be here. Got my two Covid-19 vaccine shots, though!
106435	Shit like this is why I stay home. And will be as much as possible even when they find a vaccine for the virus because unfortunately, there is no vaccine for this kind of stupid shit.
106792	Took my aunt @passionate4ever to get her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at @meijer. Lots of people waiting, but very efficient and easy process getting in and out.
105617	So true. Vaccine in NZ pathetically slow. Not good enough to b smugly sipping flat whites and feeling sorry 4 the rest of the world. Need to re-engage.
105544	It is unknown how long the immunity provided by the #COVIDVaccine may last, however, if one still get infected even after #COVID19Vaccination, #COVIDVaccines protect against severe disease and hospitalisation due to #COVID19.#COVID_19 #COVID__19 #COVID #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus

201742	Pfizer, for example, the company recruited 43,661 volunteers and waited for 170 people to come down with symptoms of Covid-19 and then get a positive test. Out of these 170, 162 had received a placebo shot, and just eight had received the real vaccine.

105539	@Mike_Fabricant @ArchRose90 Why are employers sacking the un-vaxxed - the vaxxed can still get Covid-19 and still spread it to others - so there is no protection of staff or customers ??? Can any employer or manager or MP explain this ???
106906	THIS IS INFURIATING! ü§¨ DO PARENTS NOT REALIZE HOW MUCH THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR KIDS AT RISK!?!?!? Immediately we should: üìçMANDATE vaccines for school (in person and virtual) üìçREVOKE CUSTODY if you do not get your kids vaccinated. üìçFINES AND/OR IF THAT DOESN‚ÄôT WORK: JAIL!

107317	@destinchickMBA @ABC It's called a coronavirus and he downplayed it for months after asking if a flu vaccine would cover it or doctors had considered if uv light shined on the lungs would save us all. Unless he does something concrete nobody cares if he still blathers on like a fruitbat.
106922	@SkyNews @SkyNewsThomas Ooo, I think so. I have been anyway. I‚Äôm vaxxed and had the booster, so I‚Äôve done as I‚Äôve been told and I am not getting on with my life. #COVID19 isn‚Äôt going to miraculously disappear, so it‚Äôs time to start learning to live with it. You know, like we have for every other virus.
201726	The St. Joseph Health Department had a pleasant surprise at the second dose COVID-19 vaccine clinic held at the Open Door Food Kitchen Thursday. A handful of residents came to the kitchen and asked for the shot for the first time. https://t.co/kZxF6PmVcx
106798	Any sentence with ‚Äúuntil we have a vaccine‚Äù is a waste of words.  When ever we do have one it will be 12 to 18 months for efficacy. Why is no one being realistic about this? #covid19australia #COVID19
107494	The #SerumInstitute of India wants ‚Çπ3000 crore from the Modi govt to ramp up the #vaccine production capacity in the #COVID19Era.Who do they think they are.Why would the govt waste such an amount that can easily fund another new Ultra Luxurious Jet Plane for our poor PM?
106815	The vaccines will eventually be here, but in the meantime (3+ months for most), there is a deadly COVID-19 storm raging out there, be very careful. ICUs and medical staff will be overloaded for months to come.
106923	So the entire #Covid_19 #lockdown is because ‚Äúif it saves 1 life‚Äù so i‚Äôm guessing if the #vaccine kills 1 person its a no go right? #BillGates #COVID19
105594	Im done. This is me not leaving my house but once a week for groceries. I can't do this. I spent a year in fear for my life. I was relieved when I got the vaccine. But now this! I don't want to do this anymore.

106467	"2/ Last I checked, ""China"" isn't sitting in the White House leading the US #coronavirus response from Jan 2020 to today. Mr. Trump is supposedly ""leading"" it. So guess who is to blame for how bad our country has handled it? The BUCK stops with @realDonaldTrump!#vaccine"
106080	#GenocideJohnson making us take it on the chin, letting it just move through the population, so our loved ones will die. As planned from the beginning, so continuing now. Mass death and disability without a vaccine.
107444	Absolutely not. That liquid called a vaccine has led to more infections throughout China. People think they are vaccinated and end up spreading the virus. Keep the virus contained there.
106669	I‚Äôm really struggling to cope with this pandemic, what if a vaccine is never developed and coronavirus never goes away? Will we have to socially distance forever? Every time I see the term ‚Äònew normal‚Äô in the media I‚Äôm filled with dread and anxiety. I can‚Äôt keep living like this.
106264	@NaviiThaHBIC @we38we38 @PkmnMasterHolly @MYSTIC7 Yes, but this wouldn‚Äôt be the first Coronavirus I survived. I served in an area that had MERS-CoV....and that coronavirus had a 35% death rate and it still doesn‚Äôt have a vaccine. And for 20+ years we have been sending people in and out, and nobody got test leaving.
106363	@BNODesk The best thing we can do is just live with and take basic precautions unless you want a booster shot every 2-3 months. It seems this coronavirus acts like a cold virus when it comes to escaping the immune system.

105972	This is just so unimaginable and sad. Thinking of everyone who lost someone. Please continue to stay safe and keep others safe by getting the vaccine.
105264	This really hit home.  One of the reasons I got my 1st covid vaccine was for my peace of mind.  Hopefully after my 2nd shot it will help me with my anxiety so I can leave my bubble that I have been living in for a year.  I need to do what is best for me. #COVID19 #anxiety
105474	About the vaccine..Research is still ongoing &amp; no one knows how long a person can be immune. Should people who already had covid with long-term effects be in a priority group too?#CoronaInfoCH #COVID„Éº19 #Covid_19 #coronavirus #switzerland #suisse #schweiz #retweet #share

201645	We got the J-Book, Lil Fizz, Raz B, and Omarion variants because y'all can't make an accessible vaccine and the other g'all won't take it. Shit went from Covid-19 to Covid-B2K just like that.

106668	Is Djokovic vaccine h√©sitations catching up with him ? Some may think it is hubris.Did he catch coronavirus in the past or did people get infected after his tournament ?
105628	Why do they? I had no hesitation about taking the vaccine, everyone I know who‚Äôs had it had no hesitations and people yet to have it have no hesitations. Even if they do have hesitations they appreciate they have to. If anything it‚Äôs the older generations that are antivaxxers.
105695	Just keep it moving. Open it up so that everyone who wants to get the vaccine can. No point bemoaning the vaccine hesitant. With coaxing and different incentives, in time some will get it. As for those who are totally against it (a minority hopefully), nothing you can do.

106552	@mel_faith1 @Cocoa_Bean10 You make a good point, however COVID19 stands for coronavirus which is the easiest to make a vaccine for. We actually pick up what Chinese scientists were uploading that gave America a clue in the very first days. And my feeling is HIV was NOT deemed important to American‚Äôs.
106246	@SykesCharlie @JoeBiden who probably would not survive the novel #coronavirus, like @POTUS45 did, should be thanking #Trump profusely for the vaccine he received in December 2020.

Not everyone who doesn't want the vaccine is childish. If you'd actually listen to some of their reasons, you might not agree with their logic, but you might understand why.
107608	... people who had COVID-19 already may feel that they do not need to take the vaccine. I would be interested in pointers to whether people have checked for this, e.g. polls about vaccine hesitancy‚Äù including the option ‚ÄúI will not get the vaccine because I was already infected‚Äù
106356	Ok if this is for real??then this is bigand this also makes trump correct,just not the greatest at getting message across but it‚Äôs not his fault if stupid ppl want to drink bleach.but again if true,then this is big.I would if proven to be true and work do this b4 vaccines.

106579	We do NOT have to open our door to any government employee who is banging on it.  We do NOT have to let them in.  Where I live, if they show up at my door they're trespassing and I'll call Security.I will NOT take the COVID-19 vaccine.
105723	Add Italy to that list now too. The new coronavirus variant is around 70% more infectious, ministers say, but NO evidence so far to suggest it causes more severe illness or wouldn‚Äôt respond to vaccine.
105243	@MeidasTouch We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
105437	it's  getting  bad here.     We  are  walking  amongst  carriers.  it's  getting worse.  halt the  Xmas   rules.   lock up.  I'm  doubting this  vaccine  now.
106419	Ummmm, So if ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù not 100% effective, when the hell will this illogical nonsense surrounding a seasonal flu virus end ?? Asking on behalf of human beings globally.
201659	So this could be second US Vaccine Pauses @AFP..Yesterday Johnson and Johnson-US paused Covid-19 vaccine and today Lilly? Are those indirectly instructed to pause Covid-19 Vaccine process by the @US_FDA?Author
105204	Well it's official - Sydney's going into a two-week lockdown.  I'm bringing this thread back as it's actually pretty good advice to me on how to get through it.The thing that's different - our so-called vaccine 'rollout' aka shambles.  Things could have been so different!üíâ
107659	'Compulsory' Jabs for Jobs is not something I want to see happening in England or the world &amp; yet our narrow minded government are coercing, threatening, mandating this on our NHS workers. How dare they treat people like this! #disgusting #cruel #vindictive #shameonthem #covid19
105417	@nprpolitics This is fitting...because Covid-19 is a hoax, wants to take credit for a vaccine, that he won't take...
105310	I've worked on too many - failed- vaccine clinical research studies to not agree with this.We put vaccines through extensive research for a reason. When we say vaccines are safe and effective, they've proven it.Distrust is as dangerous as an untested #Covid vaccine.
107552	@RealKPenceNotSL How is a healthy unvaccinated person a public threat?  THERE IS NO VACCINE WHICH PREVENTS COVID19. Vaccinated does not equal immune, just like Unvaccinated does not equal infected. I can't even imagine why you would make a statement encouraging interning unvaccinated Americans
107557	@NCIDirector @FLOTUS @theNCI Realistically if we can get a vaccine in 1 year for coronavirus, because of unlimited funding from nearly every nation, course a cure for cancer is out there! Not enough is being done and too much red tape and greedy corrupt pharmaceuticals  #WorldCancerDay
107250	The ‚ÄúLeadership‚Äù calls Troops concerns about the vaccine as ‚Äúexcuses,‚Äù but if they get the vaccine &amp; have reactions...they will call their symptoms ‚Äúexcuses.‚Äù  And then they ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù you to get it...despite VA denying Vets when you try &amp; claim compensation for adverse actionsüòí
105218	@cwaide3 @sarahwoodwriter Try working in the healthcare industry and for months bullied because you held out on test vaccine. Then Pfizer gets full FDA approved and coworkers testing positive for coronavirus. Bullies spreading to unvaccinated.
201715	My sister received her first Moderna #COVID19 vaccination in her second trimester. She got the second shot a month later. Her baby was born August 9th with protective neutralizing antibodies. I am so grateful to my sister's OB/GYN for ordering her the vaccine.
201668	9am-4:30pm on Saturday 4 September at Sea Cadets, Sunnyside Rd N, Weston-super-Mare, BS23 3PZ. Pfizer vaccine available for people who are 16 and over. You can get your first dose or second dose, if your first dose was 8 weeks ago.
106856	My mother is a Manatee County resident, who is over 65, and doesn't trust the vaccine rollout. Comments like this from our governor, and vaccination exclusivity such has been exhibited in Lakewood Ranch, are why. This is shameful!
201789	That uneasiness you‚Äôre feeling ‚Äî I know it all too well. It crept up on me when I was getting my second COVID-19 vaccine shot.

We have the answer with Inovio‚Äôs vaccine but corrupt Fauci and coronavirus task force refuse to acknowledge their success with funding and YOU ALLOW IT!! Pathetic
106147	Does anyone believe this? I  am not buying it. They really want to force everyone to get the vaccine. What say you?
105241	They will just make it an option for the flyers, pay extra if you want to sit in a vaccinated area and served by a jabbed stewardess. Lol the spirit way.

106486	@BogochIsaac @maxwellsmith @angela_mondou When will residents in long term care get Moderna vaccine and how are you prepping homes? My mom‚Äôs home said they aren‚Äôt doing consents until they get more specifics from Ont public health.
105455	@TomiLahren The choice of whether to get the vaccine or not isn't only about whether we think that we ourselves would get Covid-19 or survive it if we do.  It's about achieving herd immunity to put the pandemic behind us once and for all so that life can get back to normal again.
106247	Hurray! Another vaccine being rolled out. Can‚Äôt happen fast enough. In awe of the vaccine/ID team in Oxford who have developed this so efficiently.
201708	A vaccine fit for a Queen... If it‚Äôs good enough for Her Majesty (and my grandparents), then it‚Äôll be good enough for me when I‚Äôm called up. Whether it‚Äôs Oxford-AZ, Pfizer-BNT, or Moderna, I‚Äôll be thrilled to get it in my arm. üí™üèº
201687	@LilacAmy11 @thehill Let's be real honest here, it does not keep you from getting covid19! You can get the jab,wear a mask, oh and still get covid19 IS ANYONE listening.  My friend got the jab, wore his mask and still got covid19 (TWICE). leave Matthew alone!
106965	My take, FWIW: the prediction that 60-80% of us will get coronavirus is still true.  And current level of lockdown can;t last until there's a vaccine.  So at some point we are all going have to go out and face the virus again, only this time more will catch it.  Question is when.

106286	@DeanoMalcs Therefore there cannot be a COVID VACCINE or Covid-19 derivative. The vaccine is not a vaccine. But its designed to make us sterile or murder us. This is why the vaccine is Fake.
105779	Herd immunity has never happened without a vaccine in fact it is a term that the vaccine companies came up with in particular to sell the polio vaccine because vaccines are relatively new and people are kind of freaked out herd immunity sounds really cool but it takes a vaccine

106125	I‚Äôve been very anxious seeing all the unmasked people in Telluride Film Festival.  Jamie Dornan has asthma so I think he is very vulnerable vaxxed or not.  I hope everyone is well.  COVID-19 is very unpredictable.  I‚Äôm fully vaccinated myself but still takes precautions.
201651	Knocked several dozen things off my to-do list today. Including signing up with OHA so I'm notified when I'm eligible to get my Covid-19 vaccine. (also planning a drive-by baby shower in my copious spare time for upcoming grandbaby.)

106194	Pple just take care of yourselves no vaccine is going to help here instead you will get sick from these vaccines and develop complications you never had before. At this rate our scientists are not sure of what they are doing It is all about money n being bought to push narratives
201584	My whole family had COVID it was not easy and still have after effects   3rd vaccine and flu shot down.
105441	@chrislepkowski Similar experience but after only having 1st jab. First time I'd been inside a social venue since it opened, wearing my mask unless sat at my table. Got COVID19 and only just had all clear today. It's horrible, goodness knows what it would have been like without a jab.
106979	"""Ya but I'm vaccinated"" is the response I got when I told someone they seem to be going places like covid is no longer a threat. Forget immunization, the COVID-19 vaccine seems to have given everyone a confidence boost."
107412	Since Putin has inoculated his daughter first, we need to bank upon the effectiveness of the vaccine. Putin has tightly slapped Xi Jinping in the face after he wilfully spread the virus, across the world. China has given birth to this pandemic. Xi should be charged with genocide.
105225	The world is waitingBut don't buy the stock market hype around coronavirus vaccine and treatment companies (CNN Business)
106217	@HillaryClinton New studies are coming out showing that if you had Covid-19 your still immune. So those who have had COVID-19 should consider if they need it or not. There are no long term studies on the vaccine to know how long it last since it‚Äôs NOT a virus. Be smart, research and decide 4 You
105621	@HD2onPBdotcom @yggdrasilash24 @tnewtondunn Doctors are being told to write Covid-19 for all patients. Even those dying of advanced cancer. Just like a doctor wrote pneumonia for my mother 20 years ago when what she actually died of was progressive supranuclear palsy. Who is selling the kits &amp; the vaccines? Follow the ¬£¬£¬£¬£
106774	@mbzy89 @samhealey1 @madhatterpress @AnnastaciaMP All viruses mutate and the native nature of a common coronavirus, (its not novel anymore after over 2yrs), is that the mutation devolves. No-one ever catches the same coronavirus twice due to how the bodies immunity system works.Faux vaccines will also create weird strains.
105938	I am sad to say this #coronavirus is not going away anytime soon, Even after a #vaccine, you cant #vaccinate for the basic coronavirus, so making a vaccination for #COVID19= I believe is next to impossible Simply because basic Coronavirus is naturally your common cold #virus!
107251	@ChrisAlderson17 A) Your immune system relies on antibodies to work, and if you haven't contracted this virus, you don't have any.B) Acute COVID-19 illness is multi-systemic, long-lasting and still poorly understood.C) Billions died of disease until vaccines were discovered.
107072	Just three Marines who requested a religious exemption to the legally mandated coronavirus vaccine have had their requests granted.THEY ARE PURPOSELY GUTTING THE MILITARY.
106749	@deray Besides there being no vaccine as yet, there‚Äôs also no antiviral (like Tamiflu) to ease coronavirus.

105294	@GOP Those of you who refuse to get the Covid-19 vaccine or don't get your second shot are the ones whining about the country not opening fast enough. You are the ones allowing mutations. Get the vaccine and get over it.
106608	Instead of just reading news headlines, you should do some actual research and educate yourself. Reading is kinda a requirement for being a legislator. There is a vaccine for the flu. We need to be careful and patient until we are able to get/ distribute a vaccine for corona.

106504	Exactly and died few days later. Of course they don't want people to know. How else can the VACCINATOR depopulate the world if people refuse the vaccine. Hence no body gets their stimulus money unless they take the vaccine. Fuckouttahere.

It was all about timing when to bring them in. Herd immunity isn‚Äôt a policy, it will just happen in the absence of a vaccine unless you want to lockdown for a year.
106339	How does it make you feel.Watching these scum buzzards showboating getting the vaccine. While they keep you locked down at home penniless. And they're still getting a paycheck?
201796	As of 15th Feb:60.5 lakh healthcare workers (HCWs) have taken the first dose while 98,118 have taken the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccination so far. 23.6 lakh frontline workers (FLWs) have taken the first dose of the vaccine.

106033	I am hoping You are right. As far as I know the other viruses we still have not developed a vaccine for. They called off a lot of viruses research as they became dormant.
106865	How can they release the vaccine when there is pathogenic priming of the immune response in significant numbers?Especially in older adults! Can an expert comment on this?

106736	@ThisWasMash I am an RN, I get it. I doubt there will be an effective vaccine. The symptoms this coronavirus causes are a bit different than other coronaviruses, but there is no scientific evidence it will naturally take longer to run through the population.

105916	Woh. I just aimlessly wandered down the weirdest Twitter-hole where people were blaming Bill Gates for the pandemic, saying GM mosquitoes had been released, and the vaccine is going to be a digital chip inserted in us...... jeez I forgot how bonkers people are. #COVID19

105683	The likelihood is coronavirus is here to stay forever, like any virus. However there is no vaccine currently. We are in a recession, money makes the workd go round. so how do you move forward? Wouldn‚Äôt like to be making that decision.
106391	@21WIRE That's actionable legally I think, they haven't isolated the covid19 virus, so how can there be a test or a vaccine?  Lawyer up if you can parents and students.

106771	We still don‚Äôt know if having #antibodies gives immunity but it surely has to be good to have them! It‚Äôs also a relief to be know for def I had #Coronavirus. The results can tell researchers where outbreaks have been in Scotland and antibodies may also be used to make a vaccine.
107048	They‚Äôre just hoping the vaccine comes through quick enough so they don‚Äôt face pressure to do anything substantive

106966	@PWZambino @GOPLeader If there wasn't new variants of the flu there would be no need for an annual flu shot. We can't get ahead of the coronavirus any more than the flu. A true vaccine would only protect us from one variant not others that become immune to the vaccine.

106878	@Sue76329293 @CascianoJeri @mariapaolarj @joerogan SARS-COV-2 Covid is a coronavirus, so are some cold viruses. Humans do not build robust lasting immunity to coronaviruses. You can and will catch them again and again. No vaccine protects anyone from any disease 100%.
105772	Some people think the mere raising of a question is a refutation, or a dismissal, or an attack on an idea. Detailed answers sometimes require deep expertise. This thread explores why we might have a #COVID19 vaccine long before one for HIV, SARS &amp; MERS. Good thread!
105427	Exactly why it needs to stop being called a vaccine!! It‚Äôs a shot just like the flu shot. It doesn‚Äôt stop you from catching it or passing it on but it does help your body fight it if one does contract COVID. Really think more folks would get it if it was properly marketed.
106624	Pence is saying we‚Äôre gonna have a vaccine soon. Why did we wait till early 2020 to start working on one when the virus was rampant in China in 2019? Why dismantle the pandemic task force? Why call it a hoax at first? #Mismanagement of #coronavirus #VPDebate #VPDebate2020

105524	Then we will see how loyal Donald Trump's followers are to him. I mean they're willing to catch covid-19 and die from that why not be the first one to get the vaccine. It's only right.
107219	Viruses as we have been taught to understand them don‚Äôt exist and the colds and flus we can get is a natural process our bodies go through usually once or twice a year. So why do they really want us all to have flu jabs while forcing us to wear masks in the summer? I know why
106347	An absolute disgrace. Fed and NSW governments deserve very heavy scrutiny for how they let this happen - how getting a vulnerable community like this vaxxed wasn‚Äôt a priority, MONTHS ago, is beyond me. Woeful stuff.
105503	People will legit do coke with no hesitation but when it comes to a life saving tested vaccine it's an issue??? OK
105382	Once vaccines roll out, it‚Äôs super important to keep track of WHICH vaccine you get! DO NOT MIX DIFFERENT VACCINES!!!

106674	still my fellow Americans!4. I don't get the flu vaccine because...(in regards to coronavirus) I don't want to increase my chances of getting an upper respiratory illness including 4 strains of coronavirus by 36%.

105411	Roy Blunt lies! Republicans passed a 3 Trillion budget that Americans did not even get a little. They misappropriated funds for Veterans families they got zip! Covid19 relief is for vaccines so all people can get vaccines and so schools can open safely.  So people get relief

107653	One of my questions I have: Is COVID-19 going to mutate like the flu does every year? Once a vaccine is developed, would it be like getting the flu shot? Or is this a one and done thing like getting the shot for chicken pox when we‚Äôre little? Do we know yet? @drsanjaygupta

106891	@marty_walsh @BCYFcenters These tests yield 50% false positives - test positive for any coronavirus (i.e. if you had a cold or took the flu vaccine), and if you test positive they count anyone you were in contact with as positive as well.  They want the numbers up to keep us iving under tyranny.
106637	The COVID-19 virus is a plague that can be avoided if you would only get the virus vaccine shot. But then if you want to die keep doing what you are doing ,but then all the innocent people you are taking with you. You should be put down before you kill them too.
106868	It is just so depressing. Hard to get out of bed.The federal gov't is frscking up vaccine deployment.Ppl continue to not take the #coronavirus seriously. So many Americans dying.I am beyond sad. I feel hopeless.2021 isnt looking any better....

106417	this is my friends mother atm, she is a nurse but doesn't trust a vaccine made within a few months... idk how to take that
107043	What I'm hearing is that they didn't have access to a larger list of people to receive the vaccine.Meanwhile many have no access to it.It's a brand new vaccine.Of course no everyone would wanna go first.Stop making it out like it's not normal, when the numbers show it is.

105229	This is our biggest risk. A mutation like this but one which doesn‚Äôt respond to the vaccine. If this happens, it‚Äôs essentially back to square one, circa late 2019 and we have to start all over. Only way to avoid this is to vaccinate everyone worldwide ASAP.
105922	This is crazy impressive. They're gonna overtake Latin American countries who've had access to the vaccines for months.
107336	This is huge! Waiving IP protections will allow mass production of vaccines around the globe. Time to take extraordinary measures to end this pandemic. Herd immunity will only be achieved if all countries achieve it. #MedTwitter #COVID19 @CDCgov @WHO @IDSAInfo

107454	IQ level as low as room Temperature of these Pakis. It's an invitation to Paki guinea pigs from China for human vaccine trials and the pigs are elated as if they are getting the vaccines. Hahaha.  These slaves deserve China as masters. Celebrate bibi.
105818	Guess what, you will have to prove you‚Äôve had the vaccine to attend, then it will be to ride public transport, to fly the list will go on
105429	Anything‚Äôs possible. I do tend to believe in human messy error and the filthy Wuhan bat market before I believe conspiracy- just because the people we‚Äôre up against are so DUMB, but then again Bill Gates &amp; wife are all over it, pledging money toward vaccine.

105606	Know-How it Spreads1. There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19).2. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.3. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
201766	My father passed away due to #COVID19 in April. Today my mother is getting the first jab of her #Pfizer #vaccine which is hopefully the beginning of the end of this nightmare. I am incredibly grateful to the scientists who have enabled this and to the #NHS
105588	@spotted_model Even if a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, many Americans will probably refuse to take it. Something is broken.

105698	Let's try this. Instead of a swear box, every time you want to go out for an all-night bender during a pandemic, put that cash in a box for a huge party when we have a vaccine and can safely get together again. (Or better yet, support your local restaurants doing take-out)
106367	@Derridian @Wendy_Bacon @smh first business will be to privatise any #coronavirus vaccine our labs produce, for multinational profit .. then put all pensioners etc onto Twiggy's Indue card .. and probably set up some mega databases of private medical information to mine for electoral purposes #coronavirus
106523	Just seen Mike Pence on TV after he took the COVID vaccine, and it looks like he's aged about 10-20 years in the face.I want to keep my good looks so if that's a side effect of taking it then fuck the vaccines. #COVID19 #coronavirus
106212	The report is of concern because it suggests that immunity to the coronavirus may last only a few months in some people. And it has implications for vaccines being developed for the virus.
105391	@GeorgeTakei Due to my white privilege I will be donating my covid-19 vaccine to someone less fortunate. No need to thank me just doing my part.
105461	@BTone2020 @beverly_road @StephenMangan It‚Äôs a combo of extreme resources (money and minds) put on finding a vaccine plus, coronavirus‚Äô are known so it‚Äôs not like they started completely from scratch to start with.

107235	@JamieWoodhouse @susautorecycltd @chrischirp The UK pop has 93% antibodies. If the vaccines work NPIs are pointless. If they don't work (and despite decades of research, no coronavirus vaccine has ever worked) then NPIs are pointless, especially if R0 of omicron is much higher. The arrogance of thinking we can affect it...!
107313	If you need 4 shots a year of this crap, can we just all admit it isn‚Äôt a vaccine and it doesn‚Äôt work?
106200	We should stop pretending the vaccines are 100% safe and risk free for all.They trigger immune system responses *by design* and you don‚Äôt know how your immune system will react until you get the shot.Thus this is a risk calculation for anyone.I will keep wearing my kn95s.
105839	@ShaunLintern @WhackyRacesPP Also. We've tried to make Coronavirus vaccines before, with no success. And all of a sudden, everybody can make a successful one. Even a company that's never made a vaccine before (Moderna) amazingly develops a successful vaccine. It all sounds too good to be true...

105321	@KFLAPH and so should we. Especially with @FordNation getting rid of mandates everywhere. I will not feel safe to get any medical care now that mandates for HCW are gone. DO THE BOOSTERS for everyone. Now. Do not wait until things get bad. Do it. Toronto is.
107310	These measures are designed to balance reopening while controlling the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives. We‚Äôve come a long way, but it is still critical that we mask up, socially distance, wash our hands, and get the vaccine when it‚Äôs our turn in order to end this pandemic.
107245	Dear #UPSC2020 aspirants and people demanding #PostponeUPSC_CSE I want to reach out to you guys. Just demanding a postponement arbitrarily till Dec has no logic!  genuine demand should be a coherent and clear one. No vaccine &gt; no exam. The virus has post treatment complications.

105824	Digong is going gaga over VP Leni while the whole world is talking about the enormous challenges that countries face in storing and distributing a Covid-19 vaccine once it is approved for release by the US-FDA.
106011	If you get the Covid-19 vaccine &amp; get mild flue-like symptoms, then test positive for Covid-19, it only means the vaccine is doing what it is supposed to do. All 3 vaccines, contain or produce covid-19 spike protein.  The rapid antigen test actually tests for this protein.
107174	@billpeduto @ConorLambPA What can be done to make sure that the vaccine gets to the groups in the order that's been dictated?  If this is going to keep happening then throw it open to everyone.  The clinic should be held responsible here too.
106711	Just a friendly reminder that the covid-19 vaccine does not make you IMMUNE from the virus. Why do you think people in Japan wear masks. They do it not to protect themselves, but to protect others. Let‚Äôs flip the script and maybe care a little more for each other?

107257	No vaccines are 100% effective‚Ä¶ just like if you get the flu shot and then end up getting the flu, it could be from a number of reasons such as the vaccine was for the most popular strains &amp; you caught a different strain,same with pneumonia-it can help so you don‚Äôt die from it

105530	@CEOofHistory @WhiteRabbitNN @RealCandaceO Theoretical? We've observed ADE several times in history. It occured in animal trials for coronavirus vaccines! And we've never vaccinated on such a mass scale. I, of course, hope you're right. The biggest experiment in human history is underway, and I don't care to be a subject.

106067	How was the Vaccine developed so fast?Coronavirus strains have been studied for 50yrs. We KNEW the (S) protein spike is what the virus uses for attachment so vaccines were easier to develop. Worldwide collaboration, large number of testing sites/participants, and FUNDING.

106068	I keep a photo of my negative PCR results on my phone.  And I'll add my Moderna shot card when I can get the second jab.  Not everyone has easy access to 'their doctor'.  Do private practice clinicians have access to their state's vax database, like medical groups do?
105958	Mishap? Thats the whole reason people are there...to get a vaccine. Thats not a mishap, that's manipulation
106418	The #Oxford coronavirus #vaccine successfully provokes a strong immune response, an analysis has found.
106844	You all need to be asking why? Why push this vaccine that only lessens symptoms and has no long term safety data. Why? What's in it?
107293	@Charles_Castle_ @newzjunkey @RexChapman What gets me is how they make it out to be such a BFD, when it's not.Bad reactions to the vaccine are miniscule; bad reactions to COVID-19 are over 730,000.
106741	I don't understanding why they don't say the naturally infected individuals don't need to take the vaccine and save these doses to others that need it?6 months immunity if you were infected or you took the vaccine (same).
106635	Mark my words. There is a sh*t storm in humanities way when people will get vaccinated with this trial vaccine. Especially the kids will suffer in long term cases. #COVID19 #Omicron
106062	just saw an infographic about how to confront someone who doesn‚Äôt want to get the covid-19 vaccine. y‚Äôall are INSUFFERABLE
106942	Just like the flu mutates and strains change every year (why they make a new vaccine every year) so is/does/will the Coronavirus. Move on. Open the Country. Lets get on with life!
201626	Love it, @DanielAndrewsMP ‚Ä¶but would‚Äôve loved it even more if I hadn‚Äôt had my booster last month! ü§£ A big step up from the mere lollipop @mjrowland68 and I had hoped for‚Ä¶üòÇ
105514	Life would be so much better without: Vaccine passports. Required testing with nasal swabs and throat swabs. Required masking.Do you really want to live your entire life this way? SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus. It‚Äôs not going anywhere‚Äîdespite what arrogant scientists say.
106010	When the time comes‚Äîunless you CANT get the vaccine for medical reasons‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want you to talk to me again if you REFUSE IT.#DisabilityVisibility #DisabilityRights #DisabledNotDisposable
106770	@ffweekend how is it you're OK with mandatory vaccines (MMR etc.) for kids going to school yet you are outraged when it comes to businesses and schools mandating the covid-19 vaccine???#hypocrite
106737	I've asked this question before so...If the COVID-19 vaccine, ada elemen tak halal dalamnya, would you as a Muslim take it or not?
105759	Must watch video if you‚Äôre weighing up having the vaccine. Ive already made my decision. It‚Äôs not about anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine, it‚Äôs about what‚Äôs right for humanity.
106642	@discu55 @StinaJoy @ThePatrickFranz @NerdyMom1202 @business You don't understand bumkiss, you say it would be boring if we were all the same, yet you want people that have had Covid19 &amp; no symptoms to take a vaccine that doesn't protect against it or keep you from spreading it, but only lessens the symptoms.You've been fear mongered.
106629	@burnett_cain @riseupmelbourne They haven‚Äôt got a vaccine for the most common coronavirus in history(the common cold) yet they‚Äôve got one for this. Are people actually swallowing this shit. In the U.K. we‚Äôve been told the ‚Äòsecond wave‚Äô may hit this winter. Who didn‚Äôt see that coming.
105811	@DerekDenhamAlan @DPrabhata @maggiemfox @jechristensen @TAWaldrop You think pneumonia can‚Äôt scar the lungs and also cause long term problems? COVID is a new coronavirus but it‚Äôs not alien technology. No one knows if there are any long term effects of the virus or the vaccine.
106399	@JUANFENNSKI @BBCBreakfast @MattHancock we will get vaccine for covid-19 (to reduce symptoms only of SARS COVID-2) so no virus would be eliminated !!! what a scam!!!
201740	Today is a great day to get either your:‚Ä¢ First vaccine dose (only ~63% of my age group in SK has)‚Ä¢ Second vaccine dose (only ~48% of my age group in SK has)The unvaccinated are the reason for the variants. Y‚Äôall are little varient factories.
106042	Can‚Äôt even have fun on Earth during a once in a lifetime pandemic anymore. Lorrrrrddddd, stop being so fatphobic! Nobody‚Äôs eating a donut everyday because they got a vaccine..... üòë
107240	This is AWESOME news on the same day that I got my first COVID-19 vaccine. This is an epic deluxe cover of the already beautiful album that is LOVE IS AN ART.
106087	Well, it's settled with my boss. I am going to the no appointment needed FEMA site tomorrow before work to get covid-19 vaccine #1. They are closing the site to first vaccines after tomorrow and I don't want to fight trying to get an appointment. They will make appt for shot 2.
107300	@NetworksManager It‚Äôs more sinister. Covid19 ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is going to be administered like this to the people who would NOT take the shot voluntarily.
106176	@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre so worried about banning an app when all this commotion is going on in the world, and you haven‚Äôt even found a vaccine for COVID-19 üôÑyour pathetic
106729	"It takes years to develop a safe vaccine. Either they already had one developed (nothing shocks me anymore) or they're bypassing all safety protocols to have this ""vaccine"" cranked out so quickly. Both sides of the political isle are sheep being led to the slaughter. SMH"
106877	I am so tired of the insanity happening in the US. I am totally open to learning that HCQ is protective against Covid, but articles like this totally discredit their own objectives by making statements like ‚ÄúDr. Fauci who is an investor in the Wuhan Lab and the COVID-19 vaccine‚Äù
106456	@latimes Trying to make sense of ppl like this. Four questions:Were these ppl and others of their persuasion given a trial vaccine in private to see if it will work?Do they believe they are immune to COVID19?Do they just don't care?Are they under a strong evil delusion, seriously?
201611	I have lots of FRIENDS and FAMILY that have taken the COVID-19 Vaccine and all had the SAME EXPERIENCE. NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL.THIS IS THE TRUTH.The VACCINE will help us end this pandemic. IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET VACCINATED.PLEASE DO
105895	I don't even like to take the flu vaccine because of it making me sick for a few days. If this Covid-19 vaccine is offered to me? I'll take it on camera. What's a few days of symptoms compared to the grave?!
107172	@Jose_Freitas94 @realistgeo @KokeUSG It has nothing to do with COVID-19 and probably isn‚Äôt true in regards to any vaccine. I think at this point we can‚Äôt just believe everything we see in the internet
106786	How is the government still promoting something that‚Äôs not #FDA approved then if you do get vaccinated you still can catch  #COVID19  why not create a vaccine for #cancer #diabetes  #hiv #aids
201517	The man who got COVID last week and said it was mild *specifically because* he got vaccinated has now banned vaccine mandatesWhat an absolute fucking idiot
106049	@irenegarth1946 Every person without vaccine protection is a potential incubator for a new variant! This virus is able to evolve swiftly to survive. If we want a normalised world we have to get ahead of #COVID19 not just patching up after it! We can beat it if we stop politicising it!
201787	Grateful to the scientists and all involved for working so hard to produce this vaccine üëçüèΩüëèüèΩ #MondayThoughts
105255	Just got my COVID-19 vaccine. No microchip detected. Didn‚Äôt have to renounce Christ. And everyone was really nice.
107136	I am starting to think there will be games again without fans after reading of so many catching Covid19 new variant at this rate we will be lucky if fans can go2games on December 26/27th.I have had my booster but it doesnt stop1 getting Covid 19 only reduces how bad you get it.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
106803	If they mandate #Florida kids to go back to school I am going to decline that offer. No vaccine, no school. We'll homeschool.
105641	i hope this COVID-19 vaccine works with others because i‚Äôm not putting something that we‚Äôre still experimenting with, inside my body. i don‚Äôt really feel like being a human test subject.
105935	They actually were going to hype Santa in their vaccine pitch( hmmm... was this just advertising for their stock investment)ü§îü§î
201546	@6abc @6abc the segment you just aired about the Dr. who just got the first Covid19 vaccine shot and then a few days later tested positive for Covid was completely irresponsible reporting. That Dr. did not yet develop full immunity or receive the 2nd shot... 1/3
106823	I'm in favor of getting the #COVID19 vaccine, i just wish our #Governments would be honest about the side effects. Telling an alcoholic out there that the vaccine may not fully work is NOT going to encourage them to GET the vaccine. There are RIPPLES to things that you say &amp; do.
106164	"@CoondogHog @ArkansasCovid This is really wrong headed.Considering that there may be no ""herd immunity"" with COVID19 we all need to do our part until there's vaccine, not just shelter those most at risk.BTW I take offense at the word weak! Fighting off cancer, being 65+, having asthma is not weak. üò£"
107162	Now that we‚Äôve vaccinated the elderly &amp; those with certain conditions, just f‚Äông give anyone who wants a vaccine a vaccine already. They‚Äôre just getting stale &amp; thrown out.I‚Äôm mad because I just found out my brother contracted COVID-19 so close to the end of the tunnel.
201674	The Ontario government is further accelerating the second dose interval for individuals who received their first dose of an AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to eight weeks from 12 weeks.
106898	The other reason I am sharing is that there is so much misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. I am chronicling my experience so others can see the account of a person they know.
107396	With #COVID19 spreading like wild fire this is the last thing we need. Rich countries should share the #vaccine with others to reach the immunity. If not we will live with this for a long time. #VaccineEquity #vaccineforall #coronavirus
107515	Just imagine how many diseases would‚Äôve been cured if academia and industry from all over the world collaborated to take on diseases such as Cancer, Alzheimer and HIV to name a few same as they‚Äôve done with COVID-19 vaccine. Cancer will not be cured by  a research group..1/2
105379	@darryn_briggs @chrislhayes It will NEVER be over.  COVID-19 is a coronavirus, and like all of its fellow coronaviruses, it is now permanently endemic.  And no, vaccines won't stop that, humans aren't the only reservoir, there are multiple animal hosts to the virus as well.
201689	Ended my semester by getting my second #CovidVaccine. I am indebted to the scientists and healthcare workers who have been working so hard. Thank you to @moderna_tx and @WillCoHealth for both doses.Do your part‚Ä¶ remember to #WearAMask and #GetVaccinated to fight #COVID19! https://t.co/IuANI7051F
106634	@CBSLA It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúconfirmed COVID-19 case‚Äù. It‚Äôs a continued case of stupidity because some decided not to get the wildly available vaccine. All the vendors will be out cash because someone doesn‚Äôt believe in science.
106904	This is my issue. I have vaccinated my daughter but this Covid-19 vaccine is very new and I am concerned about the speed it jas been produced so I will not be rushing to take it.
106241	"Just wait until they start telling kids to turn in their parents for not taking them to get the jab.How many kids will use this ""threat"" to get ______?How long until CPS is called on parents who don't get their kids jabbed?Think this can't happen? History says yes it can."
105282	Every time I see someone who is not a doctor, immunologist, etc. comment negatively on the COVID-19 vaccine, I‚Äôm going to figure out what they do for work and make very uneducated comments about their profession. Stay tuned.
105706	Having just spent hours researching, I'm concerned there has never been a vaccine for ANY coronavirus! I did see many 'happy-talk' reports that PROMISE a vaccine but know promises usually melt away like pockets of snow.
107674	Anyone want to go raid a pharmaceutical factory for the COVID-19 vaccine and give it out to hospitals for free?
107520	For all the long term good your vaccines do @sajidjavid you might as well be pedalling Snake Oil. Everything seems to suggest the vaccines are actually getting in the way of natural immunity. This could come back and haunt us üò°
106790	@SRomanum @BNODesk Remember there is no vaccine for the common cold (a normal Coronavirus) at all. It's been 30 years and we don't have an HIV vaccine.  There may never be a vaccine.
106251	They don‚Äôt care about the biggest killer ‚Äúabortion‚Äù in the black communities nor about police killing us but they somehow care ENOUGH so that we don‚Äôt die from a plandemic. If we don‚Äôt take the vaccine and everyone else does then they should be protected from us then rightü§î?
105510	My goodness I can‚Äôt wait until they approve #covid vaccines for children. Always nerve wracking to have my kids get covid tests when they have a runny nose. If you‚Äôre still hesitant, get #vaccinated. It‚Äôs not just for you but for the kids too young to get the vaccine. #COVID19
105936	"The ""% of available"" doesn't seem like a good metric, given that vaccines are shipped in huge boluses and vaccination occurs steadily over time. They're not going to get all of a shipment injected the day it arrives and then sit around doing nothing until the next one."
106129	I remember when I went to get my first dose of the vaccine and they told me to come back in a week because they ‚Äúhad no stock‚Äù
105487	"If you can't sue an industry that has zero liability...Who do we get to sue if we have a ""bad reaction,"" to this vaccine that was rushed through testing and can't possibly have been studied long enough to know any long term side effects, and particularly any reproductive risks?"
105932	So prisoners are getting vaccines before proper civilians...so I'm thinking if you get arrested for not wearing a mask, you might get vaccinated...#COVID19 #COVIDSecondWave
107309	even if the vaccine worked as intended, Covid was more deadly and there were 0 risk it would still be immoral to mandate it. This isn't something I'm willing to compromise on, I decide my own risk tolerance, the government does not get to do it for me. #COVID19
106879	I really would love to know how many Americans are going to take the coronavirus vaccine? I‚Äôll say a prayer for you! They‚Äôll try to inject your kids while they are at school. WARN YOUR KIDS NOT TO TAKE ANY SHOTS IN SCHOOL. THEY WILL LIE TO YOUR KIDS TO INJECT THEM

106663	So @BillGates will take the coronavirus vaccine publicly on camera but some loser anti-vaxxers like Haifa Wehbe and Carol Samaha  speak against it. Maybe they should stick to gold digging in Egypt.

106851	I‚Äôm not a medical professional so I defer to med professionals on issues like this. My wife is a medical professional so I subsequently know many people in the field.The arguments I‚Äôve heard against young healthy people taking the vaccine outweigh the arguments for taking it.

106285	@davidkurten What do you think vaccines do? Seeing as the 131,000 people who have died of Covid-19 in the UK also had immune systems, why do you think trusting one's immune system is an argument against getting vaccinated?

107627	@AnthonyNBC12 4 or 5 I think?  And got my 2nd Pfizer vaccine yesterday.  But still gonna wear the mask(s) and test as needed. #coronavirus
105442	This is so critical given our current predicament (no organized plan in the U.S.) &amp; unreal effort it'll take to globally scale a vaccine. Trace, test, isolate to get cases low (did not happen in U.S.); develop therapies to speed recovery, reduce mortality; vaccine to prevent.
106018	Question:Why does the president show no interest in taking the vaccine jab?This could have really inspired the rest of the population on COVID-19 vaccines.Is there something we don't know?Have you noticed the bigwigs no longer mask up?
106872	People saying the #coronavirus is going to be gone in May are delusional. We are just going to have more tests, hospital beds, and preventative measures in place. This will not end until we have a vaccine.
107188	If you get any of these vaccines there's a 100% (+-) chance that you will survive a coronavirus infection.
107328	#Sinopharm uses one of the 'classic' #vaccine techniques, with an inactivated #CoronaVirus. Q: where did they get all that virus material from?

105658	@ShaneGrover2 @truthqst @TheLastSquatch @RealCandaceO Ok so do you get a seasonal flu shot?  I hope not because there is less data in each annual flu vaccine than 15+ months of Covid-19 vaccine.

105724	@200belligerents @ZubyMusic In the UK we have reached a point where most people know someone who has died, or has long long term illness. It is not a trivial illness. Relative to the risks from COVID19, the vaccine is very safe indeed. Despite all that, no one is being forced to take the vaccine.
107158	@starsandstripes Will there be a vaccine for the new strain of coronavirus?  I mean, it‚Äôs a virus, and they do mutate, just like influenza.
106829	South Africa is not a poor nation and shouldn't get #coronavirus vaccines donations like countries like Zimbabwe. Our economy is too big to be in this situation. Our government is not competent. That is where the biggest problem is

107624	@russellbrandom @jstephencarter @ConceptualJames And you‚Äôre ignoring that the viruses you mentioned don‚Äôt have animal reservoirs like COVID-19 and influenza.

105375	My comment on tonight's question time is.While the vaccine is rolled out nationwide are patients in hospital who are Positive with COVID-19 receiving the vaccine and if No they why not ?From Ted in Essex #bbcqt
105747	‚ÄúI got my COVID vaccine last week. Just like we always talked about. Cuz you were so excited for me to drive COVID cases out.‚Äù
107057	Minister Farrakhan just spoke And he said that if they come out with a vaccine for the Coronavirus black people should not run out and get that vaccine.
107135	@Woodhead85 @The_DogWalker @JayMitchinson We were fortunate that if we had to have a pandemic, it would be a coronavirus, something a first year med student would learn about. Tonnes of research had already gone on into SARS and MERS and specifically a MERS jab. Cancer is a wide and varied field, this was one big target.
107331	This is starting to convert me into an @ATabarrok disciple on drug/vaccine approvals. Why do we have to wait till May for this in the U.S.? (Has seemingly fewer adverse reactions than Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer too)
107620	This happened on my 2nd Year of Medical School! Even did my research and came up with Ebola diagnostic method and Vaccination üíâ.5) Next, now Coronavirus comes...did my research on treatment and vaccines and praying üßé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è to God. I do have faith knowing God always protects.

107401	oxford covid-19 vaccine for the older ageI'm waitinghow long for oral vaccine like regular cold medicinesnappy colds from China their best exportGates Microsoft do your thingmix up a brew with your smart stuffmake China payTrump in chargeDude MAGA
107465	@savoes16 @HarenThe1 @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Just imagine how many people would die from the flu if we didn't have vaccine to protect them and hold those numbers back. We have NO vaccine, and NO definitive test or treatment for coronavirus yet. You like to play Russian Roulette?
105543	@FuflunsPW @chrischirp That‚Äôs the interesting bit.  Cold virus have remained prevalent so the NPIs effective for flu less effective for colds and Covid - both coronavirus.Is it the flu vaccine that makes the difference.  Doesn‚Äôt really explain the 0.0% in surveillance in normally peak weeks.
105281	@DrSamGirgis I don't believe we know enough about COVID-19 to have an effective vaccine. I'll rely on my immune system until more is known. Anyone know where I can get a black market COVID-19 vaccine certificate so I can go back to work? üòé
106060	Part 59 in our #Covid19 vaccine drama. So. The absent father has now filed two fresh motions against us. One, to remove the chile from us for abuse because we vaxxed the kid. Two, to prevent the second vax. He already lost this in court but he won‚Äôt give up. 1/2 #NewMexico
105307	@Av8tor172 @IngrahamAngle It works for Malaria and Rheumatism but probably not for Covid19. So if everyone buys this shit what happens with the people who really need it? You get the problem right? You don't want a new vaccine tested on yourself but you want to use a drug without clinical testing?
106422	@HughGnu yer i dont know past my pay grade twitter ple what is a vaccine ?? are what we are calling vaccines re #COVID19 true vaccines is it like the drugs you take to prevent aids once you get hiv or is like the measles vaccine should we calling these things vaccines ?
106882	@BeschlossDC @bjaninemorison Republicans just don‚Äôt care if their corruption. is on display. The thing I can‚Äôt believe is there‚Äôs 437K COVID19 deaths, 1,000‚Äôs very sick, in financial straits, vaccines need to get out, budgets need to be worked out and he‚Äôs running to trump.
106038	@DanielJHannan Suppression until vaccine is not a fair prospect.It is not sensible nor even warranted, given the low IFR of Covid19Please don't defend this madness
106881	Don't do this often, but we've worked with the City in organizing an accessible vaccine clinic for people with disabilities. If you know someone that would be eligible, please share widely. #vaccineequity

106947	They can read the tea leaves: Coronavirus has got everyone distracted until there's a vaccine. Trump is a paper tiger who can't manage his way out of a brunch, much less reinvigorate alliances that he's helped strain; but he may be gone in 7 months. /2
107252	@FireyTopaz @politico Nah. Everyone could wear a mask and Coronavirus would still spread like it is. The masks either work or they don't, just like the vaccines.
105592	@PinkSkyMagazine @CaraMia200 Will there be room for discussion when they come up with a vaccine for Coronavirus? Are you really going to say no?
106718	@ChillinskyKris @CharlieViggiano @RealCandaceO @WholeFoods Influenza has a vaccine.  Coronavirus does not.  That's the difference.  If it spreads to everyone, everyone gets sick.  If you get the flu, but you also had your vaccine, you'll be fine.
107129	‚ÄúWe failed on the social science.‚Äù Who would‚Äôve thought a safe and effective vaccine wouldn‚Äôt be attractive to 30% of the population?
106478	#covid19 If a healthcare workers can go to work, COVID positive why do you mandate a vaccine to protect the patients when you are allowing the health care workers to knowingly expose patients to the virus?
201597	Got my Covid booster yesterday. Feel cruddy today, so my body's been fooled into thinking I have Covid (again), and defending me. Go, antibodies! Can say from experience it's still a lot better than actually having Covid, and will be over much faster.#COVID19 #vaccinated
201600	My Granny had her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine today and honestly I'm the happiest I've been since March
107189	That‚Äôs the news we are all hoping for... except for stocks like zoom and peleton ... everyone else is feeling this üòÇ low key I‚Äôm going to wait on the vaccine until version 2.0 comes out.
106862	@drdavidsamadi @Shanesoup1 So I have given up on getting people to stop taking vaccines. I won‚Äôt take one but I can help them and their kids get safe ones! We must help the world pivot to non mRNA no spike@protein traditionally made vaccines like #Covaxin it is @WHO approved with 150mdoses w/o side effects
106830	Absolutely.  Vaccines in general are no good.  But, to rush it then try to force it people is scary.  They won't find out til later that there are problems and terrible side effects from the vaccine.  Not to mention, Bill Gates is pushing it...THAT is terrifying!
106927	Clownish, yes, but it's also an important insight into how the media works in 2021.They're not going into that press conference with Murphy chasing a story on botched vaccine distribution or a nursing home death coverup.Their editors want clickbait. They're there to get it.
107176	@JandJFlowers @phossils @TommyMacDC @Nike @Kaepernick7 That is not true! Now there is an effective vaccine out there. Anyone who does not take the vaccine and dies of covid-19 did in fact take responsibility for their own death. Those who discourage others from vaccines are strait up killers.
105896	@WrestleTalk_TV Everybody's in ring career should be over. #coronavirus is going to lead to extinction and entertainment &amp; sporting events are only going to spread it. Vaccine won't save us. Only permanent isolation. It is the key! #BanAllSports#BanAllEntertainment
107593	Unfortunately COVID-19 will get worse because it will gain more strength along with the flu in the winter according to Dr. Fauci, but I hope the vaccine is distributed to people who want it including me because I don't want to get the virus, and spread it to other people
107243	Mid-way through my (vaccinated) bout of COVID-19 my take aways are;- Don't underestimate this virus.- Don't overestimate the vaccine.
106412	This is one of reason why my body does not need drugs and chemicals like #vaccines because it can't assimilate with the human body.Take care of body by eating healthy foods it will take of you without you even noticing.
201629	Consider I live with my grandparents and parents (high risk) &amp; I have 3y/o kid. Of Iz I need my vaccine to protect my loved ones. Sebab tu bila gov bukak je AZ 1.0 - I never listened to MakTeh or any conspiracy theories/antivax group, i straightaway booked for all my families.
106926	Folks..understand this..the Coronavirus Vaccine will work..whether you take it or not..the vaccine‚Äôs main purpose..will be to allow the media and Democrats to almost immediately stop pretending the shutdown were needed. They were not!
105655	@ChuckWendig Pneumonia is the worst... I've had it twice in the last 5 years... Begged my doctor to give me the vaccine and she will not do it until I'm over 55.
105795	Getting covid in December was my vaccine,  he got the vaccine and still got covid,  and has to quarantine, so tell me, what the hell is the point of getting the vaccine? What's the point?
106542	Nice content and gives a good clarity with all these vaccine options that are out there or soon to be out there.
107107	@ty16097410 @HansDancin @AdamSchefter No the purpose of the vaccines is expose you to elements of the coronavirus so you can build up certain antibodies against the actual contraction of the coronavirus. Yes if you do get the vaccine It may lessen the effects. Truth: we don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs new virus to the human genome!
106351	We‚Äôve had SARS and MERS before and to my knowledge we couldn‚Äôt develop effective vaccines for those. Why is Covid-19 different even though it is a SARS type virus?Or am I wrong here?Thanks!

107106	@khadijabatool98 Since the new coronavirus variant has just showed up, vaccines have become doubtful too
107077	@baltimoresun Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
107186	@KennyPresley7 @ladeyla @RealCandaceO And for the record, they never claimed you couldn't get covid19 once fully vaccinated it even states that in the vaccine paperwork ,  nothing is 100% not even bleach. Do better research is all I gotta say. It helps protect u from dying due to it or being hospitalized
201744	I have friends screeching at me that the vaccine is going to alter my DNA. I just tell them I hope I get superpowers.
106227	@errolbsk Even today since first coronavirus family.Sars MERS.. There wasn't any successful vaccine development... This won't be exception.... Treatment will be best bet.

105749	It will be voluntary, but I you haven't had it you will have to wear a mask when in public until you get the vaccine, they can't force you to get it, but they can and will withhold services if you don't get it..... The Liberal Way !!
107630	"It's because they tested these things beforehand. But people decided ""they rushed it out"" is the narrative because they choose to ignore everything that happened before the vaccine rollout. Like, how coronavirus was being studied before the 2019 variant happened."
105968	@BillGates We've survived virus before Coronavirus and we'll survive the viruses of the future. PS.. how's the vaccine coming for SARs virus, you know the so called deadly pandemic from 2002!?, still working on it?.
107292	I am seriously so happy to be able to cheer on so many friends getting their first and second COVID-19 vaccine shots. If I missed celebrating with you, please accept this blanket YAY!!!!!!!!
107623	WHO Coronavirus Special Envoy says vaccine is unlikely to save this. Thoughts from the science-startup world @matt_barrie ? Any reasonable hope there of a vaccine?!
105736	The medical people that are leaving their jobs because they won't get the Vaccine shots then charge the people a hundred a week for a COVID-19 test if I want to cross the border it's a hundred Canadian coming back it's 300.00 American and another 100.00 Canadian per person.
201748	MT @ResisterSis1 ‚Äùvolunteers who received the vaccine made more neutralizing antibodies than have been seen in most patients who have recovered from Covid-19. But a second injection, four weeks after the first, was required before the vaccine produced a dramatic immune response.‚Äù
105443	@joelpollak  I don't understand, Biden has ads saying he would take care of coronavirus. But, everything he lists that he would do like speed up vaccine etc, Trump has already done. Trump and media should press Biden specifics on this what exactly he would do different.

107586	Y r we not buying Oxford, Pfizer or Moderna Vaccine. Y we r after a vaccine which is in its phase third trial and has not proven to be of any substantial Efficacy.
105643	@KCStar @RogerMarshallMD Yes, this covid19 is looking and acting a lot like the regular old corona virus that has been around 200+ years.  They change about every 2.5 months and so a vaccine with not keep up with it never.  Immunity is really people just getting less sick if they were already infected.
106012	California will qualify you for a $1.5M lottery if you take the vaccine. How long before the state gets sued by someone with an adverse reaction or the death of a family member.
106896	Would be a shame if your reproductive system was affected by vaccine and you planned on having more kids. They haven't had the time to test these affects yet because it is experimental. I want my kids to be able to have kids. Only leftists want to control what others do.
106082	Small Pox, Polio, and MMR vaccines could not be reached for comment.I'd agree with her but we don't have capitalism in the US.We give the 1% socialism when it fucks up (bailouts) or just for shits/giggles.
105331	I got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, and 24 hours in to my pleasant surprise I haven‚Äôt had any soreness, fever, or other side effects. I don‚Äôt get why so many have been calling for people to not get their vaccine. Get your vaccine, people!!!
105492	@nmanigeria You guys should not sleep over your all important role o. The talk that Nigeria is planning to get covid19 vaccine from China is worrisome, as China did not vaccinate her population in any way to bring the virus under complete control. Stand up for us.

105540	Don't worry ! We have an Australian Billionaire politician deseminating COVID vaccine bullshit like Trump et. al. ! He's the one building the Titanic II in China! I wonder what will sink it? Not an iceberg! Will it be tax evasion/minimisation?
105458	@JHowardBrainMD What is this person even talking about? The great messaging about vaccines is if I got one COVID-19 wasn‚Äôt going to kill me or even make me very ill. The restrictions are still in place because of the yet to be vaccinated. Why is this so hard?
201545	Johnson andJohnson Vaccine had Reports of DEATH!Why would anyone want its #Booster?Americans who received Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine should be able to receive a second shot of the vaccine two months after their first dose under an emergency authorization,

106601	@SuperFastEddie1 @denisemcuevas @Cook33Dalvin So you admit spreading a virus is bad. If you think a flu only takes a few days to get over, you‚Äôve never had the flu. And when we have treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 the way we do for the flu, it will be an equal comparison. Can‚Äôt wait for that day.
106185	How are we doing this to our kids LIKE IT'S OK? THIS IS NOT OK.#MaskUp everyone, get the #CovidVaccine if you can, and for the love of whatever god (or none) that you care about, pls @FDA we have to move on the vaccine for kids like it's an EMERGENCY (the E in EUA).
105423	@USATODAY Covid19 vaccines are vaccine in trial,In Just 1st phase has shown that vaccines are not working as intended as vaccines Scientists have to go back to lab and make another vaccine , DON'T USE HUMAN BEING AS YOUR SPECIMEN IN YOUR TRIALS,WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON US
107458	@realDonaldTrump This is how much the Republicans care about America.  Before Pfizer‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine was proved highly successful, the company offered the Trump admin the chance to lock in supplies but the Trump never made the deal allowing other countries to take its place in line.
107276	@Jc_1978 Well if you‚Äôre confident to take the vaccine from psychopathic person that‚Äôs ok. The video I put up helps to know him better whether you trust him or notI meant you say there‚Äôs no long term vaccine effects but believe in long term cons from virus which is..coronavirus after all
106409	@AnnRudbeck @cliftonaduncan It‚Äôs like the flu. The virus will continue to move around the globe &amp; the flu vaccine we receive in North America each year is based on the strain circulating during the winter months in Australia (our summer months). #covid19
106641	"It baffles me every time I hear my peers say ""I don't know what's in the vaccine so I'm not taking it"" My reply-- We've taken well over 7 vaccines since birth without knowing the composition, Covid-19 vaccine isn't any different. Get vaccinated joor!!"
107445	Why are people upset? They were vaccinated. So does this mean vaccines don‚Äôt work? Or if they do and getting covid is ok, then why is there any restrictions at all? Makes no sense whatsoever. #covid19 #COVIDIOTS
106484	He needs to be on a ventilator but is refusing because he is afraid he will never wake up.Reminder that getting the vaccine is lower risk than driving on the highway for 0.47 seconds yes I did the actual math.
107631	@NigeriaInfoPH @sparklingoracle Will the vaccine bring to an end of covid19 or we will continue to wear face mask and maintain social distance even after taking the vaccine? Again, my joy is that they will start with the leaders before it gets down to the ordinary people.
106372	@RUSSREBORN i went to my clinic to take my Covid 19 vaccine but now I‚Äôm scared, all the vaccines are gone. Coronavirus star player Russell Westbrick took all the shots. he said ‚Äúi treat my vaccine like I treat the court, i take all the shots‚Äù. Whyyy Westbrick. you built my house last week
107269	The Covid19 pandemic is still spreading. The vaccines may or may not work. The chances of not working are higher. The deaths will keep on piling. My estimate of 10 million deaths is likely to be achieved despite the vaccines.
105456	@Dan79596368 You kill me looooooool this is a false equivalence. We don't need COVID-19 vaccines in order to keep our jobs, get an education, buy food, all we need is competency or whatever
106885	I've had my booster and would urge you all to get yours too .. lets do what we can to keep everyone safe !
107514	Oh god. The WhatsApp aunties are gonna be on our ASSES ü•¥!! They‚Äôre gonna think hot lemonade is the covid-19 vaccine now.
107112	This is why I said take all you can out of me, not doing any good except pain, I am HIV negative which indicates I would be susceptible to influenza/coronavirus which is a cold or flu hence I took Coronavirus vaccine for colds
107125	This is going to complicate things for people claiming to have a ‚Äúreligious exemption‚Äù from getting the vaccine, which is great because COVID doesn‚Äôt care whether you believe in it or not. It just hopes you‚Äôre dumb enough not to get vaccinated so it can take over your lung cells.
107529	@FilmFreeway If they can do that then certainly we must be able to get a proper vaccine for COVID19. Let's get that done &amp; then we can all get back to the theater again...then I'll buy my ticket to see it! üé¨üìΩüéûüíü

106850	Partially resistant to new vaccine- so this ‚Äúsounds‚Äù like it‚Äôs hitting the already vaccinated or they‚Äôd have not phrased it that way.  Sounds more like the vaccine IS the new variant. But some of us predicted that didn‚Äôt we? Pathogenic priming anyone?

106354	Survey: if Harry Roque volunteers to get the SinoVac jab FIRST, will that be enough to convince you to get this vaccine?
106895	Basically I'm going to be hoarding different coronavirus vaccines like they were toilet paper four months ago. #inners
106587	When in this world did Bill Gates become an authority on vaccines..if i believe Bill Gates 2021 prediction why should i doubt Trump #COVID19
107463	So if you use a religious exemption to avoid the COVID-19 vaccine, you don't get access to monoclonal antibodies either, since they were involved with aborted fetal cells.  Horse paste enema is your best choice!
105973	As someone who took the COVID-19 vaccine:I will force BOTH my jobs to fire me if they start requiring documentation of vaccines.
106297	"CBS Evening News just reported (very briefly) that AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial has been put on hold after an ""unexplained illness"" (or an ""unexpected illness"") in a participant.Pretty sure this is how one of the zombie apocalypse movies/video games started."
107561	@nytimes I feel sorry for anyone that is desperate enough to have poison injected into their body these vaccines are not safe so why the hell are people still getting vaccinated. Coronavirus isn't New it's been here this version was weaponized to be deadly

106685	Coronavirus is just one example. There are other diseases affecting millions and there will be new diseases in the future. Getting the foundations in place around the world is the best defence. Good nutrition, vaccines, water and sanitation, diagnostics &amp; treatment. For everyone.
107341	I hope 2021 will be better. But I don't think it will be. The 1918 pandemic flu still continues to circulate amongst us today and it took years before the waves subsided. I think the same will happen with this coronavirus. But hopefully the vaccine will make things bearable. 5/n

201755	@fox12oregon Got my random pick to get tested again at work my results came back negative going on 19 or 20th. Time I think still no coronavirus or symptoms still safe and protected without vaccines.
106632	I automatically think less of anyone that went to Oxford University if this I the garbage they were taught... explain to me professor how this super deadly virus that you have to give up your freedom and job for to get the jab will just magically turn into the common cold.
106772	"I think @HamiltonMusical should lean in on the ""I took my shot"" angle when promoting covid-19 vaccines."

107596	@sj_ca1867 @wildace @carlyjchalmers @klaidlaw @WIRED Specifically the coronavirus vaccine, obviously, And people without symptoms don‚Äôt need tests. You get a ‚Äúcasedemic‚Äù when testing everyone as PCR is not an indication of illness.the giver in 2009 decided to stop mass testing of swine flu to stop that casepidemic.
106698	Where are the legal/human rights people etc? Blackmail, coercion, abuse etc supposed to be illegal is it not. What happening over forcing COVID19 vaccines is going to change the world in a very nasty way. I just hope it the bullies that get the hard times &amp; not the victims.
201768	@NototyrannyNOW I got the vaccine, I‚Äôm a conservative. I‚Äôm glad I got it because I‚Äôm exposed  daily to Covid19, but have never gotten sick. Why are you hesitant?
106567	@dazbrady @CenGinLondon @toryboypierce @Keir_Starmer @BorisJohnson @coronavirus so what is government‚Äôs responsibility then? when do you hold them to account ffs? why is UK having worst death toll and worst recession at the same time? what did the government do right in this pandemic so far? and don‚Äôt say vaccines, thats down to individuals coming forward,
105701	So, to sum up the GOP's current talking points, the coronavirus is a hoax, but if you get sick by it, it's the Democrats' fault. Also, you're paying for your own vaccine.
105975	Let it continue to devastate the families.  I don‚Äôt care any more. They had their chance to get the vaccine. The deserve what is coming to them.
106024	@NHarris956 @RexChapman It‚Äôs very simple You don‚Äôt want to receive the #COVID19 #vaccine you don‚Äôt get to have the same privileges the rest of us do. We have rights too‚Äînot to be sickened by you!
105407	@Tickittybooboo @linda__lou @Mandy1258 @peacelilly44 it's worrying this new variant of Covid-19 let's hope the new vaccine will still protect us from it the scientists are quite optimistic about it, I hear they're working on a nasal spray vaccine that will be good for the children fingers crossed it's rolled out üòäüëçü§ûüôèüíôx

106546	@NewYorker This is the scariest article I‚Äôve read in a very long time! Since flu vaccines for each year are made from data taken the year before (because the flu virus mutates), what hope is there for an effective Covid19 vaccine to be available before mid 2021?üò∞
105290	This fucker is one of the reasons why poor countries cannot fabricate their own vaccines so we can vaccinate the world. He needs to be taxed to hell, and then some.

106570	@StephanieKusie @erinotoole @ShannonStubbsMP @JohnBarlowMP @tomkmiec @KerryLynneFindl Italian researchers: vaccines will not work against SARSCoV2 because this virus does not only replicate in human cells like other viruses, this one replicates through bacteria too.

106124	What if they pack this with a Trojan Virus for which they will be the 1st to discover the next vaccine?
106089	1. How do I get the vaccine? Do I tell my doctor I'm a teacher?2. When do I get the vaccine? Before I go back into the classroom?3. What about other education professionals? For example, EAs and ECEs also work very closely with students.#OntEd #OnPoli
105865	"""@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Awesome. How soon will we be back to the 5 cases he promised? How soon until we get to the """"everyone who wants a test gets a test"""" that he said we already had? Does he still think an influenza vaccine will work on a coronavirus?"""
107271	New vaccine they are saying it will take months to roll-out I say it will take years, there are approximately 64.8 million people in the UK work it out...
106855	No one could die for a month and we would still have a second wave just like the first one it didn't happen. They lied about everything. This is about the vaccine that's all wake up people. And I still don't know anyone who has had covid19.
106454	I already have no plans on getting this vaccine because I have common sense. But do they really think THIS is going to get more people to get it? Let‚Äôs be real, the people who look up to these shitbags are the ones who already got the vaccine.
106986	transmitted by a bat, it is probably from this that they started, then they modified it. Maybe they wanted to make an AIDS vaccine using a coronavirus as an antigen carrier. A work of sorcerer‚Äôs apprentices can be said. Because we must not forget that we are in the world of
107237	@WashTimes In the end 20 years down the road you will see commercials on TV about anyone who has taken the coronavirus vaccine or who has died from it or has gotten sick call the law offices for compensation. Something to think about when you get that 1st injection.
107084	My anti vaxxer ex best friend contacted me not to have the vaccine even though I am immune compromised and suggested exercise instead... #Covid19Aus #Covid19 #Covid19HighRisk #COVIDIOT
107039	@eddiefcoffey @Gypsygoddess1 @NorthElstew @LOXandBAGELS909 Small pox is a real vaccine. We have only a therapeutic in Covid shots. If they could have a real vaccine for covid-19 they could have a real vaccine for the common cold. I doubt that will happen. Just my personal opinion.
106525	You're going to be put on a list if you refuse to take the vaccine that does nothing but make you sterile.
105313	@Independent I‚Äôm not an antivax, I hope we‚Äôll get soon an effective, safe vaccine for #COVID19 but this Labour call for censorship really explains what Labour has become under Sir, an authoritarian, undemocratic, dangerous party

106991	@drsimonegold Too many opposing opinions and statistics. No way of knowing the truth. It's simple! If you don't want the vaccine. DON'T GET IT!If you catch COVID-19 and die from it. You'll have no one to blame but yourself. And if you do want it. GET IT!But stop forcing everyone to comply
106144	@NBCNews @GavinNewsom Why receive a vaccine for a virus with a 99%+ survival rate, if it is still not clear wether you can still get infected afterwards?
107642	I just cannot get over what a shithead our governor is. He doesn't present a coherent plan of any kind for vaccine roll-out and then when hospitals understandably are chaotic in getting the vaccine out there, he punishes them. This guy MUST be a one-term governor. Outrageous.
106028	@CliveMyrieBBC @PhilipIngMBE @NHSBartsHealth Stop the preaching. Time will tell if you parents are safe raking this synthetic pathogen as it‚Äôs legally not a vaccine.

106694	@datboyolly Half ml CoronaVac coming out of China based on pathogens. AZD1222 immune response out of Oxford. So they have already given details but given the fact that there has never been a vaccine for any strain of coronavirus, that's my point, that we should still be very worried.

105956	@YRavenOFFICIAL @hennecd @iHeartApple2 @LegendaryEnergy You bring up a good point. Ivermectin is dirt cheap. If ANY chance it effectively treat COVID-19 it should be studied extensively. The US govt didn't bother studying it because if it worked out would prevent emergency authorization for the vaccine and it won't enrich big pharma.
107270	@realDonaldTrump Anyone has a vaccine for this pandemic, maybe China has the answer their country is clean and they do not have more people with the infection and send doctors to Italy to help with the pandemic, at first hand the Chinese Government developed this pandemic
106411	@Meditationsndz @americamag If they only wanted to engage #POTUS45 on issues he was sympathetic towards, why didn't they urge him to issue an Executive Order to the FDA to develop an ethical #coronavirus #vaccine free of aborted fetal cells?
105911	Mf‚Äôs keep saying they don‚Äôt trust what‚Äôs in the Covid-19 vaccine as if they forgot they went to rehab twice for heroine. Like mf, you‚Äôre worried about the wrong needle.

107422	@Annahar There is hope. In china and Australia and other different country they are using malaria and HIV medicine for coronavirus.And it is working.Plus a vaccine will be approved and done after couple of months. Take the right precaution U WILL SURVIVE
105589	The #COVID19 vaccine news is great. Now, how do officials plan to sell it to Americans who are already saying they won‚Äôt take it?

107040	Misleading.If a vaccine was going to be available by that date we'd know.Trump may try and get part's of trial's skipped and fast track one.This is to set up a system as to how a vaccine will be distributed.Who first and so on.I don't have any trust in CDC.This is bull.
107491	@gator_gum I think the provincial governments are hoping they can vaccine their way out of Covid-19 without having to admit it is airborne. The government wouldn‚Äôt like the investments that are needed if they admit it is airborne.
107429	To all those pushing for the elderly to get the vaccine before the healthcare workers who are actually working with COVID-19 patients, even if the elderly get vaccines now it won't be safe for you to expose them on Christmas -- it takes three weeks plus another injection first.
106179	Also thanks for the friendly reminder my friend... The vaccine will not replace what we do everyday. We still have to do it until everyone gets vaccinated.
106395	The Oxford vaccine is safe and immunogenic. Now we need to know how effective it will be in reducing the risk of contracting COVID
105208	@DaveColan That‚Äôs not even a comparable statement whatsoever. Drunk driving is illegal. Getting a vaccine is a choice. If you think not getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the same as drunk driving you really need to re-evaluate your thought process as a whole.
107578	@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The vaccine will only work when people can get it. Eight months after this began &amp; the average American still can‚Äôt buy a disposable n95 mask. You expect me to believe Trump could manage distribution of a #coronavirus vaccine that requires 2 doses?Gaslighters gonna #gaslight.
107379	Americans be like: my body my rules I‚Äôm not growing a third nipple, btw vaccines give u autism and turn u into a hairy latino
105613	Our very trustworthy political leaders will get on national television and be administered a vaccine so that the people will gain trust in the vaccine. Sounds legit, hope the CDC has a whole link on how it's safe since Pence and Biden took it

107634	@MurkeNyou @mesosuchus @Ned_the_zombie @TitusNation Nope. The technology is not new, I never claimed that. But the actual pharmaceutical is new. It was developed last year. They did not have the genomics sequence for COVID-19 until the epidemic started. They could not make the vaccine until having that You lose.
106474	I would like to give people the covid19 vaccine so when my son grows up, I can tell him that I helped in saving the world.

106502	Over reaction to this omicron is remarkable.  $PFE just said vaccine is 90% effective.  Vaccines are safe and effective we‚Äôve been told.  This strain is less virulent we‚Äôve been told.  What is going on here?

201782	On my way to get my first dose of #COVID19 vaccine at the @LondonDrugs pharmacy in #NorthDelta! 0% nerves. 100% excited &amp; grateful!! ü•≥Wearing my ‚ÄúWe are all in this together‚Äù #DeltaBC fundraising tee - local businesses supporting local nonprofits here in out community. ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/lx5lYV9CLP
105585	@DrWaqarRashid1 @Iromg @talkRADIO Viruses don‚Äôt do wavesWe already have immunity#PandemicIsOverExperimental vaccines MUST NOT be rolled out ...that would be a crime against humanity.
106288	Ok, so watching nurses get their first coronavirus vaccines is unexpectedly making me tear up. I think my employer is starting vaccinations on Wednesday, with me probably getting it on Thursday?  I think.
105516	My college is offered extra does of the Moderna shot last night for those in pierce county! if you can, get your vaccine now! #VaccinesWork #vaccinatewa
106995	Morning after receiving the 1st round of COVID-19 vaccine, the only side effect is my arm is a little sore. Just the same the flu vaccine. Still able to complete my shoulder workout this morning, so not a big deal.
107082	Herd immunity will be with us soon with 10 Million people in London only half following the rules. Vaccine will not stop coronavirus we must all move on. And get back to normal after Brexit.
107256	@nopicnicshere @NotBoise @broxygoose @gofasterandfast @samanthamarika1 So many of us. I had COVID-19 I did not need hospital treatment and am fine. I did not get vaccine and am not planning to. I trust my natural immune system.
107507	@yonalunsky @beccapauls @ReadyForMyShot It was no problem getting my first Covid-19 vaccine. I had no problems afterwards.
105947	@steved76152722 @Jessmaster88 @Ocugen We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
107119	WH MUST stay out of scienceThis just undermines any credibility the vaccine may have.I for one would not take the vaccine as isAnd I pray that we get the vaccine and quicklyJust wrong and playing w our lives
105284	@aubrey_huff It should be made illegal! They dont require that for any other vaccine and they certainly shouldn't for the coronavirus vaccine either
106207	@WillBlackWriter You do understand this is a mRNA vaccine?  If you have already had Covid-19 and survived your body has produced the exact same Covid protein as the vaccine is intended to stimulate to produce.  These idiots should really do their research.
106450	If a #COVID19 vaccine is approved in 2020, 65% of U.S. voters surveyed believe it would be rushed without enough testing and 58% said they would wait to get the shot, while 21% said they would never get it, according to a Sept. 6 CBS News poll.#vaccines #FDA #pharma #biotech
107315	If the vaccine works as advertised, then we should not fear the unvaccinated.   If the vaccine does not work, then why are we mandating it? #COVID19
106706	@anxious_Winter2 I had the Moderna vaccine. The needle they use is very thin‚Äîit caused no pain. For a day or so after the shot, I had arm soreness and a slight fever. I also felt great relief knowing I and my loved ones were much less likely to get seriously ill from the 2019 coronavirus.
106775	@Ali34351471 @JamesMelville My immune system has looked after me very well so far. I don't need a vaccine for a coronavirus with an exceptionally low mortality rate. They can shove it.
106867	@GOP The truth is #Trump has absolutely nothing to do with the vaccine! It is our vaccine from Germany! Yes, if you @GOP gang hadn't spread lies about the Covid19, 800,000 Americans wouldn't have died! Period!
105602	Why are #Medical #personnel being injected with either empty syringes or ones with a retractable needle? Why do they fear the #vaccine? #COVID19 is not a dangerous disease so they know that no #Vaccination will do any good #cdnpoli They are #antivaxxers #bcpoli #onpoli
106090	The first person to take the COVID19 trial vaccine in the United Kingdom has died!!!#COVID19 #3rdmainlandbridge #COVID„Éº19 #Qanon#4thmay #lockdown #ufo2020 #Health #GatesOfHellA trial is already claiming a life, imagine what the actual poison will do...
106742	@ryanstruyk @CNN @JohnsHopkins If China created COVID-19 why wouldn‚Äôt they create a vaccine before releasing it? Could China already have a vaccine to protect their communist elite???
105266	"I keep seeing ppl say ""wheres the cure for the Coronavirus don't let the scientist fool u. We have a serious problem and It might take months to slow the spread. It took us like 5 years for a vaccine for SARS which is a different form of coronavirus so good luck with that cure"
106299	I believe in opening up America but I also believe in mandating strict adherence to the CDC safety guidelines for COVID-19 and that all people should probably get the vaccine not be mandated to get it but do it on their own
106933	Since 1921. So why does everyone think a vaccine for COVID-19 is going to be some kind of cure all for the virus. The virus will most likely never go away. If you want to listen to an expert on how to avoid getting the virus, listen to someone speaking on building...
201583	seems like I'm one of the lucky 275,000 Australians that have been fully vaccinated against #COVID19 out of a population of 20,000,000 plus according to my Covid Certificate I received today after my last jab (via myGov) WTF @ScottMorrisonMP this is not good enough #AstraZeneca
106656	@JohnMappin China figured out how to make a perpetual coronavirus that is attacking the world, which they have the vaccine for, but will never share until submission.This type of Warfare is Democrat/Deep State approved.Time to start busting some heads. Count me in @realDonaldTrump
105385	@TeamPelosi There is a vaccine against the Coronavirus, China has it, it does not say it because it would accept that it is guilty of spreading the Chinese virus
106016	A reporter just asked Gladys: ‚ÄúWhy are unvaccinated aged care workers still in the system?‚Äù The #media are helping the government push mandatory vaccination to the point where if you don‚Äôt get it you‚Äôll lose your job.Shame on them. #auspol #COVID19 #vaccine
106096	We NEED everyone that can be vaccinated to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Protect your family. As soon as you are able to get the vaccine, don‚Äôt hesitate.
106380	@JimmyLloyd20 Hey Jimmy. I took the coronavirus vaccine yesterday. I'm diabetic and my mother advised me to. Anyway I have a questionIs it normal to feel soreness near the injection site?
105538	Hey Boris, I will go get my vaccine (Not a phucking chance) if you tell the Nation how many people died FROM covid? Remember not WITH, tell them how many actually died from covid.. I will wait as I know everyone will want to hang you when they know. Psss it only a few hundred...
105261	@joaomtcosta @helopait @DrTomFrieden Why haven‚Äôt they ever developed a Coronavirus vaccine do you think?  Why????????  Think????  It mutates too fast/often.  Anti-vaxxers aren‚Äôt the problem.
107221	All these coronavirus stock will go to 2 dollar No vaccine will be effective Eventually all will develop antibody on their own if they don‚Äôt already have
201565	To celebrate getting my first #Pfizer vaccine! I‚Äôm going to stream some @PlayApex  tonight üôÇüôåüèª @YouTubeGaming @YouTube!! Just going my part to be safe from #COVID19 @PlayStation
107157	I am not #streaming tonight - I am a bit under the weather after receiving my second COVID-19 vaccine. Nothing serious at all, just kinda feel crummy (which is to be expected) - I am gonna try and get some rest. I will shoot for streaming tomorrow night &lt;3 Love you all!#music
106281	The @AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is beginning to sound like an @Apple IOS update. One has to wait for others to try it before one realises it there are bugs to sort out. üò≥ü§î#AstraZeneca #Luxembourg#UOT#CovidVaccine#COVID19UG
106970	There is evidence that Hydroxychloroquine and Dexamethasone are effective...there is no money in that though! To date there is NO vaccine for any coronavirus, so what confidence can we have that there can be an effective one for Covid19 -  in a very short timescale?ü§î
107588	No üòê.(Why is anyone getting the vaccine before #HealthcareHeroes? Why did #OJSimpson get it? Has everyone that works with the public gotten it, yet? How are #smokers a priority? Why has only 2% of the population gotten it? Why can't they figure this stuff out?)
106557	Why would I give my children and experimental vaccine for a curable infection?  If you would have listened to our President we would have seen this gone in weeks after initial exposure.   The dems are going to try to get segregation one way or another.
106355	What the hell kind of statement is that from Franklin? Who says they'll get any vaccine they'd give me? That's just plain lunacy.
105325	@gabrielyanrob USA is NOT a dictatorship and NO WAY will they make covid19 vaccine mandatory! That‚Äôs unconstitutional &amp; mentally and PHYSICALLY abusive to enforce it on everybody! üò§üò†Let those people get it who want to, and healthcare workers need to get it since they work with sick patients!
106547	"Dead serious, I just saw this Q submitted for Sanjay Gupta on CNN:""So if I don't get infected with coronavirus, do I still have to get the vaccine?"" WTF are we doing in science class these days?"
105762	Dear @WHO @MohamedBinZayed  @HHShkMohd  @modii @BBCWorld don't no it's work or no but we can try to make artificial rain with covid-19 vaccine I think it's work
106152	Wed morning's @CapRadioInsight is focused on coronavirus vaccines. Do you want it right away?Guests:@carlzimmer @DrPanMD @illumina@traveling_mb#AskInsight
105292	I'm gonna do an experiment to see if this string of words will restrict my account.COVID COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS MICROCHIPS 5G VACCINE NOVEL OXYGEN
105590	@VujaBoskov You live in a world where my #coprifuocoalle22 saves lives.This Is my agreement with #coronavirus Later It scass o mazz to everybody W u General
105825	@wave3news So here's another push by this in power to get vaccinated, but why? If it's a new variant, how can there already be a vaccine for it? The old vaccines are not going to be effective, yet they're pushing us to get jabbed now! Why? #vaccination #lies #COVID19 #control
106625	I think there will be a vaccine. The question is whether it will be safe and effective or just another con like Trump University. I am betting on a con that will result in even more deaths.
106533	Because vaccines aren't a magic talisman? They don't make you immune to Covid, they just give your immune system a better chance of fighting off an infection should it occur. This is literal 6th grade science stuff.
106787	The coronavirus is a VIRUS, not unlike the common cold (rhinovirus) (I AM NOT A DOCTOR SO I COULD BE WRONG, DON‚ÄôT @ ME).There‚Äôs no vaccine for the cold. Y‚Äôall really need to shut the fuck up about a magical vaccine, because I‚Äôm really fucking tired of hearing about it.
105882	Grown people in America can't comprehend the damage that their opposition to vaccines has caused.They don't get it that this virus is mutating weekly.Conditions change for US all weekly.Stop complaining about something antivaxxers have caused.Do what you should. Mask and vax.
106302	The vaccine isn‚Äôt an immunisation. Every winter the NHS is in crisis. Fix the NHS. Oh and the vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop you catching or spreading the virus it‚Äôs just meant to stop you being poorly enough to go in hospital
201673	@darakass I'm pro-vaccine and am fantasizing about a COVID19 vaccine daily but I won't trust a Nov 1st vaccine.
105735	@AlexDevantier I will commit suicide before I take a coronavirus vaccine I've had all other vaccines. No way in Hell am I having this
201573	Feeling thankful! My parents got their first dose of the #Moderna #COVID19 #vaccine back home in Illinois today üíô
105409	Everyone in Estonia and the other countries must get Covid-19 vaccine!!! That‚Äôs very important for all of us to get rid of this terrible pandemic!!! Please keep your distance and wear a mask!!! Please tell the others too to get their Covid-19 vaccine!!!
105341	@jw_wilkerson @_StephanieMyers @OANN Are you telling me i have a greater risk of dying from this vaccine than the actual coronavirus. Hahaha. No thanks. This is hilarious why would i take the vaccine. Im going to say its against my religion
106465	I say this to the person who seemed proud of having gone 46 years without a flu shot, are you going to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine when it comes out?I said I get the flu shot for myself and because my MD demands it and these are true BUT I also get it so that I don't
106257	"""X number of people still haven't gotten the vaccine"" But do they want the skunk vaccine? They want the vaccine made for animals?? I thought we were done taking medicine made for our furry friends"
106388	Though the threat of Covid-19 is real enough, why is SA and other countries being pushed into taking the vaccine, when China the origin of it all recovered using herd immunity?
106398	@LebienHeure @guardian If you didn't need to get a flu jab every three months, why would you need to get Covid-19 boosters this frequently? It makes zero sense.
105857	@DHSCgovuk @MattHancock We not be able to get a vaccine for the coronavirus been trying for years yet in 7 months you've managed to get one for covid19. No liability clause too. Yeah right! There has been no long term studies so how do we know what the effects are after 1 to 2 years.
107670	Hmmm so children should take a vaccine they don‚Äôt need for a virus the vulnerable are protected from just because adults say so....? Not the best lesson to teach kids.
107205	@KniskernMary @vgcrutchfield @RonFilipkowski I think my wife has an extra coupon you can use.  It gets you a free microchip enhanced COVID-19 vaccine with any two late term abortions.
201559	I can finally make a tweet to say that my parents officially got their first doses of COVID-19 vaccine today! An awesome sigh of relief. Stay safe everybody! Thank you @HPEPublicHealth #COVID19 #Vaccine #BayOfQuinte
107476	@mickiedances @Sowzees @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC 1 a flu virus with a vaccine and acquired immunity. The other is a novel Coronavirus without any acquired immunity and no vaccine. Your hype is pathetic.
107080	I have to option to get the Covid-19 vaccine today since I work in a long-term care facility, or I can wait a couple months for the second round....
201660	Ugh. Someone give me the vaccine. I am back in the classroom this semester and I reallllly don‚Äôt want to get sick. I‚Äôve never been to the hospital  and I don‚Äôt want to go for the first time at 37. #COVID19
107640	"I have the feeling ""Vaxminster Jabbey"" will be taking up laughing rites in my belly for the foreseeable...#covid19 #GetVaxxed"
107359	@BlueBisonBBQ @Hell_Ashes @theoctobear @Derek_Hennett @AlexNotAnder_ They were going to use this type of vaccine for SARS but the disease almost disappeared after a year. So they had done there trials like for Covid-19 which took about a year but by the time they were going to roll out the vaccine to the public the disease was as widely spread.
107267	#COVID19 #Vaccine...and,... vaccine only lasts for a few months, it's not lifetime.(And if you got China's vaccine, it's good for a few minutes. Enough to get you back from the clinic to your car. üòÇ)üò∑‚úåÔ∏è
201711	Got the 1st dose of my @pfizer COVID-19 vaccine today with @offthemike28 today @csunorthridge https://t.co/4P4PZA1aQQ
106106	@skinnywhiteki11 @DoubleBullseye1 @SharpFootball That‚Äôs weird ...How long has Chinese Virus been around? Just because it is a ‚Äúnovel‚Äù Coronavirus will we have to come up with a different vaccine for every strain? why don‚Äôt we have a vaccine for H1N1/SARS? How many job losses per life saved are acceptable? 10 Million unemployed

105993	@SusanRLane @BrakTalk @William84214395 @ZeroFrucks @clairlemon There is not one covid-19 vaccine. They are all different.
105845	Bill Gates warns against coronavirus vaccine going to highest bidder ‚Äî Oh, very well. Let it go to his kids (Billy's kids) free of charge. We don't want it, anyway. Besides, they're probably speaking of that wiccan broth Melinda pulled out of Cernunos ass.
106310	Because they haven‚Äôt got their vaccine yet. Why? Because it‚Äôs not their turn yet. Until when? Until when? Harini je dah ada a few under thirties without any comorbidity issues died. And yet there are elderlies yang tak dapat vaccination date lagi.
105858	Vaccines prevent infections in the first place. Governor Chaos wants you to get sick so he can make money on the treatments.
