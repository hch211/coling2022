0	107301	Given that the average survival rate to this virus is 99%, who will take the vaccine? I sure won‚Äôt. Never took a flu vaccine either.
1	105412	@FrDaveNix I hear belief in the virus will be added to the Credo.I believe in one coronavirus....and its only begotten vaccine.
2	201657	The CDC recommends receiving your second COVID-19 vaccine dose three weeks after getting the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and one month after receiving the first Moderna shot. But what happens if you miss your second vaccine appointment? https://t.co/JZ5bRrdNpf
3	107587	Just in case you‚Äôre wondering. I‚Äôm never having the vaccine. Whatever if threatened or offered. I‚Äôll die before I take it. #COVID19 #covid1984 #vaccine
4	106375	@EssexPR @sailorrooscout This is very strange though. We know the flu vaccine has only ever been 20-40% effective, yet a brand new coronavirus vaccine is effective not only for current variants, but all the new ones too ü§î
5	201665	A COVID-19 vaccine update:2,191 #Windsor-Essex residents have received their first dose only, while 9,888 have received two doses. A total of 21,967 doses have been administered to area residents.
6	106873	@Foward44 @NBSaphierMD It's far fetched to call this a vaccine when it doesn't even give you any immunity to catching the disease unlike actual vaccines. And besides, needing 3 jabs a year too is just ridiculous for a 0.096% mortality rate Coronavirus.
7	106338	@realDonaldTrump Yes, but are humans too Mr. Trump, The coronavirus is burying all American warriors. They have the technology to go to the moon, but to find a vaccine they are screwed.
8	107068	@nshealth When is the Covid-19 dashboard going to be updated to reflect vaccine uptake in the 5-11 year old group?
9	201513	#COVID19Vaccine side affect; soreness and swelling in my arm and insanely vivid and crazy dreams. Holy shit in one of them I was a beast üòÇ lol #COVID19 #CovidVaccine and I haven‚Äôt even had the 2nd dose yet
10	105466	I don‚Äôt even think why they‚Äôre refuse the Vaccine, At this point it‚Äôs like Kids Fighting Sleep, You know this is good for you, you just don‚Äôt want to be told what to do. #vaccine #Vaccination #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #GetVaccinated #GettheVaccine
11	201498	This afternoon @GovBillLee is at the White House for a COVID-19 Vaccine Roundtable. He was just recognized by @realDonaldTrump, and appears to be one of just a handful of governors in the room.
12	105471	@DebraG_Robins No, but given the process usually takes 10 years plus and we have never produced a vaccine for a coronavirus, I think 2 years is optimistic.
13	106093	@Sheepdog_89 @yourclueless2 @GovMikeDeWine Are we breaking down into absurdities because me being rational was too hard for you? Colds have medicine. Flu has a vaccine. Coronavirus does not.
14	106353	@SportsnetPR It is wholly irresponsible for your broadcasters to be saying that people need to make their own decisions about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. They should either encourage everyone to get one when it‚Äôs their turn, or say nothing at all.
15	106520	@thebradfordfile @MsAvaArmstrong It's a distraxine. No vaccine has ever been approved for a coronavirus (35% of common cold viruses)We don't need one (99.9% nonlethal)The test is whether you have testes or not.
16	105928	"""I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science -- not politics or cronyism -- has to lead the way."" - Rick Bright, after he was abruptly dismissed from leading the coronavirus vaccine development team because he wasn't aligned with what the @POTUS wanted to do!"
17	107164	@JanssenUS I spent 5 months last year in the hospital and nursing facility didn't get COVID-19 my doctor told me never get that vaccine i don't like vaccines and never needed one
18	106343	The hoarders will see how a vaccine doesn't care what's in storage, and those countries where it is unavailable will continue to impact the vaccinated countries until Covid is eradicated. #VaccineApartheid
19	107657	"Coronaviruses are in every animal so if you've ever had a flu vaccine you were injected with #coronavirus"". Wonder if this is why #fluvaccine is being pushed so enthusiastically this year in the UK...2nd wave 'n all that..."
20	105921	@HummelTown @MattWalshBlog Do you get hepatitis, polio and measles after you have gotten the vaccine?   Can you still get COVID-19 after the ‚Äúvaccine??   Hello!!
21	106368	if this is true then 1) the vaccine doesn't work and 2) we were lied to and 3) do we really want to do the NEXT insane thing they try to make us do? I sure as heck don't!
22	106065	@urkagurka If some already had prior immunity, like my 89 year old mother had, It's lasting and we have nothing to worry aboutOnce encountered and recovered from any of this crop of Coronavirus variants we don't need a vaccine at allIt would not give benefitClear enough now
23	107026	@courtlynn30 - 2I'm actually think, maybe I go out and get Covid19, so they will FRICKIN' leave me alone when the Mandatory Vaccine comes....
24	106444	Um, did they need a placebo group because they didn't know the effects of Covid19 with no prophylactic treatment? If so, they are the wrong group to be putting together any vaccine I would be willing to try.
25	105835	@thehill Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
26	105421	First refugee in the world to receive a coronavirus vaccine was in Jordan, a country of very limited resources. What an inspiration King Abdullah is to the rest of the world.
27	201500	Got it today. First jab of Covid19 vaccination in PHC Bhagwati Nagar. Thankyou @narendramodi ji #IndianScientists #RakeHangloo ji and @BJP4India https://t.co/plCYsIoxlm
28	106726	At this point anyone still telling people not to get the Vaccine or not to take the #coronavirus seriously is just a platinum certified idiot and should be treated as such...the #media should stop treating them like folks with a different opinion.They are simply morons
29	106079	I love this. As soon as I can find an appt I should be able to get my #CovidVaccine too. It's been a week since I became eligible as a person who is immunosuppressed.
30	107078	Trending that 30 crore Indian's should get free #COVID19 vaccine  free of cost. Then rest 102 crores? Which system is it? Don't understand. We want vaccine for all Indian's. ‚ù§#VaccineForAll #Covid19India
31	107159	@angrypengu1n They are eluding to ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt force you to get it, but they can make continued employment conditional on getting the #Covid19 #vaccine‚Äù which I thought was essentially coercion.
32	105636	@SKyriakidesEU @AstraZeneca Those vaccines do not work on a new virus/strain. How many different/vaccines do you want to be injected?  Two or three or 5? If you do, then think of an pig experiment. Those coronavirus is a new beginning. The rest will be a real racing.
33	106712	"You can't keep locking us down until there's a vaccine, you imbecile. You have no idea when that will  be, or even if it will ever happen.  Personally, I feel as safe as I ever have, and I owe you nothing. There is no ""we""."
34	105565	If COVID-19 is so deadly why is it that the BAME who are refusing to take the vaccines and refuse to social distance aren‚Äôt all dropping deadü§î
35	105856	So, in other words, if you want your life back then vaccinations become mandatory?? @InstituteGC you actually want to take away people rights to do normal things if they don't have the vaccine?? This is insane!! What has this country come too...
36	105854	Wait a minute, how TF does this work?Is the goal here to help the vaccine recipient or the vaccine creators?  @PsychSavant
37	107368	Just wait until they start with the worst coronavirus yet when they blame it for everyone dying but it really was the jabbathehut
38	105597	@QuestionerMoney @Kean1S @allymaclusk @NicolaSturgeon Yes, I know flu has vaccines. Usually between 20% - 60% effective. My point being, even with a vaccine we haven't achieved elimination. There are reasons we've never developed a coronavirus vaccine other than not being able to. I don't doubt there could be a vaccine sometime.
39	105930	I‚Äôm certain this is going to be the only mishap in these vaccine rollouts. BUT GO GET ONE OR YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE YOUR HOUSE.
40	106510	The government‚Äôs policy on #COVID19 can be summed up as: ‚ÄúIf you survive, or don‚Äôt get long Covid, well done. If you do, it‚Äôs not our fault. We‚Äôre not going to do anything to mitigate infections; we‚Äôll keep our fingers crossed that the vaccines will save you‚Äô.Or: good luck
41	105400	@ellencarmichael People, including the government, need to stop waiting for a vaccine. It might never come. We've not been successful with finding good vaccines for coronavirus before. We need a different, realistic plan.
42	106071	Biden‚Äôs COVID-19 strategy for vaccine distribution and economy recovery is so normal that it is incredibly shocking to my system. That‚Äôs how bad it‚Äôs been. 100 million vaccines in 100 days is shocking to my system. That is all.

44	106982	"@DrKND @apropoofnothing Speaking of the phenomenon of ""virus interference"",Dr. Rick Kirschner wrote: ""It's like a one-two punch. Flu vax sets it up, coronavirus delivers the knock out blow."" Or perhaps the coronavirus vaccine sets you up to be vulnerable to the next virus coming down the pike."

46	107433	@AlanRMacLeod @venanalysis @CancilleriaVE @maduro_en @camilateleSUR 1) to be fair, this is the appropriations bill, in which the coronavirus relief bill was tacked on to..2) BUT... $33 million to meddle in Venezuela‚Äôs business when there are hospitals in our country with 0% ICU capacity in a pandemic + not enough vaccines for everyone. okay!
47	105645	As someone who has had two jabs, I support the international vaccine programmeBut why is there a misleading sticker on this?
48	105941	‚ÄúI am afraid ‚Äî and people don‚Äôt like to hear this, but I‚Äôm kind of constantly preaching it ‚Äî we have to prepare ourselves for the idea we do not have a very good vaccine. My guess is the first generation of vaccines may be mediocre.‚Äù
49	106357	@latimes I've some great examples too. I've a sister who keeps feeding my mom lies, and gets angry when my mom doesn't agree with her. She and her husband told my parents that Covid19 isn't real, that they shouldn't take the vaccine because it's a gov scam.
50	201580	so my external ovaries ARE supposed to swell from the Covid-19 Vaccine.. correct? Okay, good. Just making sure.
51	106673	The Vaccines to the Virus that Trump supporters think that is a hoaxThe Vaccines that Trump supporters will implant an microchip into their bodies..Honestly they are so insane that even though they think these things that they will applaud him for what he's said

53	107441	@Vscarp20 If you‚Äôre not angry about COVID-19 you should get angry. This is not ending soon. This is only the beginning. They estimate this may ebb and flow for YEARS until we develop substantial herd immunity (or a safe vaccine is created). Years. Not weeks. Not months. Years.

62	107427	@DonnyDonowitz10 @pmarkhemming Currently Covid19 vaccines are not included in the Government's vaccine damage compensation scheme. One has to wonder why.
63	107356	@bigpictureroxi I don't know if everyone realizes just how remarkable the human accomplishment of the Coronavirus vaccines truly is.
64	107053	So after vaccine, WHEN you get covid, you could have milder illness. But you‚Äôll still be infectious SO you can still carry and transmit the virus. How‚Äôs that going to control the spread since vaccinated people are allowed to move around etc?
65	105903	@daosouthwest @simondolan The Pfizer vaccine has upwards of 90% effectiveness.So if you take it you probably won't get Covid-19.If you don't have Covid-19 you can't give it to anyone else.Seems like a good idea to me.
66	106972	Wow. &amp; good. @DeptVetAffairs is now making COVID19 vaccines mandatory for all heath care personnel. I wonder if/when they will expand the mandate to everyone working in a medical center like they do for the flu shot?
67	105738	So if the letters in the word Corona add up to 666 doesn't that mean that the Coronavirus is evil and from the Devil? It wouldn't mean the vaccine would be evil. The vaccine would be the opposite.
68	105480	@roper_93 We don't need a vaccine because he has banished COVID19.  No one else has become sick or died since he banished it. Thank Jeebus for Copeland! And for those who are going to come at me, this is sarcasm.
69	105650	@MoshPunksNFT hehe, I don't really love the Metal Zone(even though it can sound good when everything is fully cranked). My tweet was about getting the Covid-19 vaccine.

74	106242	2 weeks ago my family made the incredibly difficult decision to move my father-in-law into a nursing home amidst such strange and challenging times. Today he received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and I am so very thankful.

Thank you to Dr. Shivani and the entire team for doing an amazing work at Cornell community centre. https://t.co/IGyxAvsCpS
77	106376	@CDCgov I will not get the vaccine. I will go where I please. I will not submit. I've already had covid-19 and am alive and well! I was neither treated with nor prescribed a z-pak, antibiotics, hydroxychloriqine, or antivirals. My own 51-year old immune system was and will be sufficient.
78	105326	Why are politicians not participating in this #COVID19 vaccine trial? If they're meant to be looking after us surely they should be the ones who test it out first.
79	106870	@reubing @SarahJRossiter2 Curious aren't the flu shots tainted with the flu would that mean the Coronavirus shot is also meaning that a vaccine already exists and why important people are getting the virus
80	106602	So from what I‚Äôve researched SARS, which is a coronavirus, just disappeared without a vaccine.Interesting.
81	106716	Black and Brown do not take a vaccine please be aware of it be notice My people May God protect and guide us
82	107499	Brazil has a very contagious variant. It's important that the US sends our best vaccines around the world to protect all peoples. Biden has made a commitment, but none will leave until end of June.
83	201682	The vaccine-induced reduction in my anxiety was starting to creep me out. Good thing I have good reason to feel so anxious again that my cortisol levels spike.
84	107523	I couldn‚Äôt articulate it exactly, but this is exactly what my complaint is right now with respect to the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù about boosters. The only questions they need to answer are: 1) is it safe? 2) will it help protect you?Then let people decide for themselves.
85	105279	as long as pi is everlasting there will be no effective and safe vaccine for coronavirus @LuciferDaily @federalreserve @ThelIluminatii
86	107525	@MelissaFloBix I actually meant what I said. I am ashamed to be a Finnish person and know that our government doesn‚Äôt supply Covid-19 vaccines to less privileged countries. Currently my country leaders hold the vaccines just in case they will someday give the booster shots.

88	105386	Good news! Biden is doing such a great job handling the coronavirus that we don't need to take the vaccine!
89	106752	@JainNirmal Yes Mr Nirmal. However this prolly is beacuse #china already has a vaccine for #COVID19 . But yes sooner this will get resolved.
90	106137	THIS is why I'm really not in a rush to get the vaccine. Or planning on doing anything this summer. Or this Christmas.
91	106732	@TheEliKlein @CT_Bergstrom If you were trying to shield people from a static danger, say a toxic spill, the fix for the spill would protect everyone.  But Coronavirus is alive and constantly changing, quickly mutating to a form the vaccine doesn't stop.  (cont)
92	106204	@Ismwatcher_up @Chimmy31 @StarAdvertiser Oh, and if anyone had ever invented a single shot Coronavirus vaccine, they would be billionaires, because they would save farmers TRILLIONS. Doesn't Bill Gates research chicken coronavirus, hmmmm, wonder why, oh to make more BILLIONS!
93	107191	Just because the mandate has been lifted doesn‚Äôt mean I personally have lifted it for myself. Yes I am vaccinated. I just want to make sure I am safe so I will be wearing my mask until Ohio has higher vaccine numbers. It is my decision üò∑
94	106564	@BriannaWu I don't agree with this second part. I had an adverse vaccine reaction due to autoimmune disease and the Covid-19 vaccine poses a risk to me, agreed by 3 doctors. That said, they wouldn't sign an exemption. There are a lot of us lost in this system.

108	106352	It's important to recognize that getting the COVID-19 vaccine is not safe because it was rapidly developed and tested.
109	106606	@DiscipleColin @wytewzrdz It's the reason we don't yet have a vaccine for HIV as ADE causes worse problems than the virus. It's also plagued every Coronavirus vaccine creation ever known, and yes 'they' knew the potential for ADE to be a prob with these new vaccines but went ahead anyway.
110	105300	@VMcIntyre13 @AddieCo76160156 @CMOH_Alberta Actually they are *incredibly* safe, even as vaccines go. Anti-vaxxer nonsense is not borne out by the millions of safely administered covid-19 vaccines administered so far.
111	107604	@kellieb926 @usual_suspect89 @AnaCabrera Is that what they do? Because I'm fairly sure we still have the flu, but there is a vaccine. It's meant to help protect you against dying or getting seriously ill, and to slow down the virus. It's unlikely that CoViD-19 will ever go away completely, but it can be controlled.
112	105966	Now that we know the risks, it's important those of us who've had the vaccine keep an eye out for any concerning symptoms. Please take note and share it around - the (VERY rare) clotting side effect is treatable if addressed promptly.

120	105761	@imtheaudioslave @willriley100 @bunny6munro @Danny_McDonald @TaylorMadeSM @HYPPSWins  Tory government so what could possibly go wrong The Oxford vaccine, called ChAdOx1nCoV-19, is made from a harmless chimpanzee virus that has been genetically engineered to carry part Coronavirus
121	106364	"@rant_rn Thanks RN Rant! More and more people need to KNOW that the entire ""vaccine mandate"" has nothing to do with covid-19 as the ""virus"" was never isolated! There is no dead virus (which is their excuse for it) in the ""vaccine"" (provides no immunity)... ie IT'S NOT ""SCIENCE""!"
122	106623	Just because they got an injection, it doesn't mean they were injected with the vaccine.#CovidVaccine
123	106334	Until a vaccine is developed and/or medications developed how is it going to be safe to mingle with others?Serious question for the experts.#coronavirus
124	201525	I got my first @pfizer vaccine today and I feel great! Get vaccinated when you can and when your time comes! #COVID19 https://t.co/8SA2UL9a3Y
125	106361	@lizcabrera55 If I'm convinced it's safe, and it likely is, I'll definitely get a vaccine.  I don't want to get coronavirus nor do I want to spread it.  I suspect that the risks from the vaccine are far less than the risks from contracting covid-19.
126	105720	We don't have any vaccine for Covid-19 in India. It is expected to come next year. So how negligent UGC can be for us@PMOIndia @ugc_india @DrRPNishank@HRDMinistry@31Petitioners#StudentsInSCForJustice#31studentsagainstugc

128	107584	@DrZweliMkhize I don't know much about vaccines hey...the polio vaccine seemed to work...so maybe the Covid-19 vaccine will work if developed around more or less the same principles. I don't trust the conspiracy theories about the vaccine. If it's found I'll go for it...that's just me.
129	106015	@realTuckFrumper @DebbieParkes3 If we can coordinate to fight #COVID19, then we can work together to fix this too. I have no medical training, but I was able to put my IT skills to use last year to help, get researchers what they needed to develop a vaccine. I'm sure I can do the same again.
130	106128	Was there really a ‚Äúreversal‚Äù? Or did DOH just stop counting in order for the order to be given to open up the economy. Is that when everyone started throwing away their masks? The cases are rising like gang busters now. DU30 wants to hand out free masks. Got vaccines???
131	106740	So has #tcnt !Pack those churches: Bill Gates is secretly putting microchips in to track you with the vaccine!Just kidding: That's beyond insane. Right Jon?
132	105368	@washingtonpost This is the BS articles before Biden takes office and then they give him credit for saving the nation from Coronavirus, even though President Trump did all the hard work to get us the vaccines approved and fast-tracked.
133	201521	I feel like wooden planks are attached to my neck.But I'm done editing from Kisumu, where more like me are finally taking their first Covid-19 jab.I also engaged hospital administration and the Governor on how Western Kenya is averting an infection crisis.All across BBC today. https://t.co/GUgOXUIKrc
134	105507	If only there were vaccines available. I'm in the high risk group and I'm still waiting for my first shot.We should be getting ready to start protesting, except it's not safe because we haven't had our vaccines yet.
135	105639	The vaccine really amped up my Gen X apathy levels. Haha j/kNo really, the vaccine allows me to focus all my anger &amp; rage at anti-vaxxers thru my eyes.#MyVaxxedSuperPower
136	107370	@SaltaoVladimir @EastOfEpworth @lnstigator_ @BallouxFrancois Sorry, but vaccine data do not support your optimistic assumptions about resuming ‚Äúnormality‚ÄùSorry, but there is no point for herd immunity for this virus but endemicity The faster we allow the virus recirculates among healthy people the better
137	106373	"Not because of ""that"" because of a tyrannical disgusting creature like draconian inhuman consciousness that does not belong on earth. We are not your slaves. Vaccine cards don't belong in the human race nor do humans deserve to be injected against their will."
138	106951	@ricksokugawa No reputable person has stated the vaccine prevents covid19 100% but that, if one does contract it, the chances of dying from it or being really sick are drastically reduced.
139	105623	@bodhibrian @SkyNews this early vaccine development project has been a hope stable for the current vaccine being developed. Prior to SARS-CoV-2, there was never a major threat by coronavirus as the one we‚Äôre seeing now. So the urgency to create a vaccine for them was more warranted.

144	201593	@BDUTT @DeShobhaa @tavleen_singh @DILIPtheCHERIAN For your information. We all senior citizens got vaccines, my daughter &amp; son in law of 45 and my granddaughter of 21 got vaccine in Gujarat. No queues, no hasstle. Thanks to our beloved PM @narendramodi

149	106835	@catturd2 Luv you Mr catturd... but Covid is NOT  real.... it is only vitamin d deficiency and radio/cell tower sickness.  There is no covid19 virus because there are no viruses.  What we perceive as viruses are merely cellular debris. Beware the killer vaccine.
150	105380	Lol: It's not a waste, vaccine are 95% effective meaning it doesn't work in all circumstances. But it's better than zero % protection of not taking one. Normally those who survived virus will have immune but it's not always the case... It's complicated. #Covid19SA
151	105568	Okay. I know I have asked for a lot and Japan gov‚Äôt has ignored it all, but please please PLEASE may they stop ignoring the pandemic and approve this vaccine for kids super fast here. PLEASE.
152	105997	@ThomasEWoods There has never been a vaccine developed for any variant of coronavirus. I believe this will be the same.
153	107374	@notawokelefty @sailorrooscout @SteveBakerHW The human immune system has literally no reference for novel coronavirus. It only develops one once you either get COVID or you get the vaccine. And natural immunity is temporary, while vaccine immunity will be a lot longer-lasting if not permanent.
154	107298	Honestly when this Covid19 died down and a vaccine is found, everyone would treat it like a normal everyday influenza. So no need to panic at all.
155	107212	"Why is Fauci hesitant about a drug that we already have and can work to cure Coronavirus? Fauci is friends with B. Gates.  Is he stalling to approve Hydochloroquine because his ""friend "" is working on a new vaccine? Yet, Gates wants population control...ü§î"

159	107044	@JohnLukeSam1 I got the #COVID19 vaccine. I also like living, don't want to infect others, and I want to do my part to ensure #COVID19 doesn't spread throughout the country (it still is but I can't stop the deniers)  FYI: The needle didn't hurt. My arm did but only for a day or so.
160	107569	Lower drugs yes. But not a vaccine that has the Covid-19 virus in it.Read Creature from Jykell Island and Deep State:50 years... These people wants the population thinned out. Taking the vaccine could kill you any way

162	105212	It's too late! Hard pressed GP surgeries are already having to plan priority group 6. Just like the PPE guidance, unpaid carers are an afterthought. #unpaidcarers #vaccine #valuemycare @carersworldlive
163	105904	This article is fearmongering about the vaccine, under the guise that they don‚Äôt want to give antivaxxers more ammo. I‚Äôm taking the first COVID vaccine that my doctor says is safe for me and costs me under $100 after insurance. Even if side effects put me in bed for 3 days.
164	201520	Soon as I got the jab in my left arm my friend sends me a link to Costco nearby that has Johnson &amp; Johnson in stock so I can do a one and done. Got the J&amp;J in the right arm. No Covid-19 for me and I can continue to work.

166	106683	@AaronBlake @RonBrownstein The flu does not go away with a vaccine its still there.The coronavirus will not go away with a vaccine either,the vaccine will hopefully protect us from getting the virus .
167	105298	After we find the Coronavirus vaccine, can we work on an anti-moron vaccine? Blonks in Fluffy's replies truly need it.#LALISA #LISA
168	201616	Just tried to book my first and second COVID jabs online.I could get my first jab 2 miles from my house but I would have to travel 32 miles for my second jab when I don't drive.How the fuck is that going to help people get the vaccine!? Absolute mess of a system. #COVID19
169	105838	@SuzieWB101 ÂÅáÁöÑNote: The above satire is fictional in that Mr.Gates has made no such speech and the Gates Foundation has not established any funds to compensate vaccine victims or to make available effective, inexpensive COVID-19 remedies. All the rest of the article is factual ‚Äì W.Gelles
170	106834	Ok everyone it's been 6 months, even my degen gamer lifestyle requires some instances of social interaction once in awhile. Hoping we can get a vaccine/stop spread and get back to normal soon :(
171	105270	So who did they made it for when they don't even take it? People should never think of taking this poisonous vaccine
172	107443	@JpStrand27 It means somebody‚Äôs getting paid. 99.985% survival rate, even with the vaccine I can catch it &amp; spread it, so the vaccine literally does not make you safer. All the vaccine does, theoretically, is lower the severity of coronavirus if you get it. Like it or not this is the science
173	106630	I do not think the average public understands what ICU triage is. This is a very BASIC explanation: When there is not enough resources, staff or space to support you in the ICU, someone will live and someone will die. Please get vaccinated #COVID19AB #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
174	105777	I'm sorry if this isn't really a good thing to say but I'm not 100% sure if I want the coronavirus vaccine yet. I've honestly been really stressed lately and I don't think it's a good idea put even more pressure onto myself just yet, even though I am eligible for it.
175	106958	@POTUS Everyone, regardless of immigration status, should get vaccinated when possible. The vaccine is free, and there will be no immigration consequences for seeking COVID-19 testing, treatment, or vaccination. There is hope, but we can only get through the pandemic together.
176	107537	The issue is the people against vaccines who get covid won‚Äôt take these. It‚Äôs a good try but they will pull the same shit
177	106555	?????????good for them i guess??It's presented as though we're supposed to get mad about this but I don't really see why we should.North Koreans getting the vaccine is good, actually.
178	105275	Some people are actually refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine and while explaining their reasons why, they actually think this makes them sound intelligent.
179	105711	Seriously,  they have been running around without masks! And most are antiscience- so why would they think a vaccine will work?
180	107183	Why are all the politicians getting the vaccine when they didn‚Äôt do shit for us for most of the pandemic? Give it to the real heroes, healthcare workers, first. Not to mention giving it to the people who downplayed it ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

183	106842	just a reminder that horseshoe crab blood is used in the Covid-19 vaccine, please try you‚Äôre best to help protect these beautiful creatures. if they weren‚Äôt as important to u before like they were to me they should be now ü¶Ä
184	106883	@Lopez4VA Giving vaccines to everybody is the only way we are going to get past #COVID19.Those who complain about immigrants forget how much our economy depends on the work they do to make America function &amp; survive.

185	105891	Official petition to make masks a thing after covid too.I really like how it hides my ugly face.#coronavirus #CoronaVaccine
186	107343	When our Immune System is 99.95% effective, according to the CDC, why in the world would anyone take a vaccine that changes their DNA, not to mention the fetuses used to culture them...#AbortionIsMurder #COVIDIOTS #Covid1984
187	106117	Is it weird to feel that the basics like having a job and paying the bills don't feel as peak adulting as going to get my COVID-19 vaccine alone...I've always had Mama in every single one of my doctor's appointments. GP, OB, psychiatrist, therapist - you name it, she's there.
188	105931	So they have bypassed years of tests for the #COVID19Vaccine and to top it all off the virus is mutating. You cannot make a vaccine for something that then changes. The vaccine is then not only unsafe but useless.
189	106704	THE European Union is on the brink of coronavirus chaos as an Irish politician has called for the vaccine task force to be mandated to give unused AstraZeneca vaccines in France and Germany to IrelandHAVE A NICE DAY
190	106317	Tweets slating people refusing the potential COVID19 vaccine. I myself, will carry out my own research and remain objective at all time, it‚Äôs my body and my life. Therefore, my choice If I want this vaccine. There‚Äôs so much about vaccines people don‚Äôt know. Educate yourselves pls
191	201786	Here‚Äôs the gear I have to wear in my medical office in order to safely see patients.

193	107462	@janetlcardin @CBSNews There are seven known coronavirus that can infect humans. Four common ones,  plus MERS, SARS, and now COVID19.

198	105877	@laurenboebert He‚Äôs probably got investments in the pharmaceutical company that is making the coronavirus vaccine. Now wants America to purchase enough for the world. But that stock just went way up
199	106315	Being from Bihar I think the politicisation of vaccine is Nonsense!!- Every Indian life matters- Free Covid vaccine must be given to every unprivileged citizen- If you give us Vote,we give it to you free. If not, then What?- Is Covid vaccine a commodity?#BiharElections2020
200	106304	@P_McCulloughMD After all there are 30 smthing different coronaviruses and flus that we fight w our developed adaptive immunity- Does covid vaccine replace adaptive response for all coronavirus / seasonal flu  infections we encounter going forward or do we get tht back at some point?
201	106540	@miramotamv @NPR I don't think you'll see the first one of any coronavirus vaccine until sometime late next year 2021. When they show trials, they give people hope that it will be soon but that's just not the case. They need a lot of testing, and then comes production and dissemination.
202	105495	@theRCN @HelenDon_RCN @buttynot @gallagher_rose @CNWLNHS Easy to get people to take the Flu jab this winter. Much more difficult to get them to take the Covid-19 vaccine next spring. To promote that poorly tested vaccine would be unethical, immoral and only legal because World Governments will change their laws to accommodate it.
203	105755	@RunJumpStefReid How would the vaccine be performance enhancing, compared with someone that is COVID-19 free?
204	107420	Gonna have to put my ass to sleep before they try and give me a vaccine ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm getting that.
205	106469	@realDonaldTrump you keep saying you're immune from COVID-19 since you have already had it. Why would you then need a vaccine? Either you're lying (you are) or you're stupid (this is true too)
206	105511	@_Mic_hael_ @JTyler36213241 @MMAFighting The research currently suggests that the antibodies will only last a couple of months. We don‚Äôt develop long term immunity to any coronavirus - this is why the flu vaccine is needed every year and we always gets cold - we don‚Äôt develop immunity.
207	106853	@MediaSequitur They certainly do not have our best intentions in mind. It is also illogical to make a vaccine against a zoonotic virus, one that T cell mediated memory immunity confers a strong response to across the Coronavirus family. SARS patients from 2003 have immunity to COVID19. This is
208	106482	I did post this on an anti vaccines thread as well as just posting it generally. Doesn‚Äôt seem like vaccine hesitancy is the big issue even if it is a small sample size
209	107424	Don't think I would. I was always against the flu vaccines but the corona vaccine would be no different. Don't trust 'em. They are 10x's more dangerous than a virus, in my opinion.
210	106921	How  do u know if   vaccines are effective?How can any1  predict if a person  can  get  infected or  not  in  the future ?BTW,  Covid RT PCR test kits  are  fraudulent and  they  were  made  way  back  in  2017  when Covid19 wasnt even  discovered

214	107585	@MaryLTrump Considering what a hoax the coronavirus is according to the GOP, it's unconscionable that they're lining up for the vaccine!
215	105727	@DailyCaller Surely no one should take this #COVID19 #vaccine. They will still have you in lock down and it will not even end the virus.
216	105790	Joseph R. Biden is calling for a total and complete shutdown of [J&amp;J vaccine] entering [our bodies] until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on [/figure out how to overcome the precautionary principle in simple cost-benefit analysis].
217	106139	There‚Äôs still a lot of testing to be done, but it‚Äôs some interesting stuff.  I got my flu vaccine because 1. I always do, and 2. if I actually got the flu anytime soon, I would be losing my shit until I was able to get a Covid test.
218	106496	@marketman52 @donnahot4Gaz Just curious... Did you get tested for Covid-19 or take the vaccine yet ??
219	105231	@LorimerPam I might be in the minority here, but I‚Äôm quite happy for my daughter to go back to school on 1st June. Coronavirus is here to stay. The risk level will be the same in September, and there‚Äôs no way a vaccine will be ready by then!
220	106045	My county is one of the red ones. All my neighbors now have COVID. They say they feel ‚Äúfine‚Äù and so none of the ones not sick yet won‚Äôt get vaccinated.

221	201646	@libshipwreck (nods)I imagine the implied assumption here is that the Covid-19 vaccine is Just Like The Flu.As in: You got to take your flu shot every year, so why not take this vaccine? After all, the Covid-19 vaccine is...Just Like the one for The Flu.üòíüò∑
222	105578	"Did you notice the Ukraine health minster resigned because of, wait for it, a bungled vaccine rollout...? Linda Reynolds would certainly think Ukraine has too much ""natural empathy."" Meanwhile, the Liberal party has negative empathy, no accountability and zero competence."
223	106260	@sa_vvy_ What is this? Please stop! Get the covid-19 vaccine. We're in a time lapse in history; the polio or hepatitis B vaccines were developed in a time like this, &amp; now, every child has to take one. They aren't considered mark of the beast.

225	105593	@rbrookbanks I still don‚Äôt understand why anyone thinks a vaccine is going to work against a coronavirus that mainly kills people aged 80+. Treatments will be the long term solution, not vaccines.
226	105807	@ConfusedTim @ansumDave @Quiggling @jonlansdell @Telegraph If. There is no guarantee nor has there ever been a vaccine for any of the 4 circulating coronavirus currently circulating.I hope it proves right but I have massive fear that it won‚Äôt be.
227	107166	My neighbors had people over again. They do it once, twice a week.I forgot to mention they live in the future, where there‚Äôs a vaccine for the coronavirus.
228	107255	If we don't get real about how dangerous Covid is, we will never get ahead of it. Viruses mutate. Constantly. Continuing research on vaccines &amp; continued mandatory masking protocols are going to be needed.
229	107036	@realDonaldTrump Is it 105b worth of coronavirus vaccine? Cuz that's what's preventing kids going to school. Republicans are holding us up on reducing cases, since they're hurt by a piece of cloth on their face.
230	106976	@Hricho151 @ThomasEvans1984 @alexblackmore67 I didn't say we wouldn't get hit again, as long as you maintain certain rules it will be manageable, masks, distancing, cleaning hands and so on.Herd immunity will save more in the long run because immune people can not be carriers and no Coronavirus vaccine has ever been made.
231	106254	There is a vaccine for the flu, but there are alot strains of flu. One vaccine doesnt cover them all.People still get the flu every year.If a Covid-19 vaccine is created, how long will it be good for? Will there be multiple strains a vaccine doesnt cover?

265	106954	there is a flu vaccine yet for 35 years I have had to watch out for the flu. I cant have a flu shot and I would assume that I also wont be able to have a Covid-19 shot. So unless you're going to mandate everyone healthy gets the vaccine it will change 0 for me.
266	105436	I wonder how this is going to get resolved. It's hard to imagine a scenario where 70 - 85% of Americans voluntarily get the vaccine.In this age of contrarianism, it's hard to imagine any matter where 70 - 85% of Americans would agree on the resolution.

279	105684	@Cyndula @TheJordanRachel Yes it is when the vaccinated are getting Covid-19 again. There are probably multiple strains already around. Hence the new variant.

350	106115	@EricTopol @ScienceMagazine @ScienceVisuals They've tried for years to develop an RSV vaccine with little success. Is coronavirus an easier target?

354	105238	"@WHO @mvankerkhove A vaccine for each potential strain is difficult. There is the issue with influenza, the new strains to predict for the vaccines in different countries with different ""flu seasons"". Coronavirus isn't any different. Find better solutions instead of digging your heels in the dirt."
355	105267	"I love how there is some scientist sweating the hell out of these details, and there will be thousands of other people safeguarding this vaccine before it can get to me ...And some YouTube idiot (or the Prez) is gonna be like, ""It's not safe"" and half the country won't take it."
356	201549	I had my second shot yesterday (of Pfizer) and was asked if i had ever had blood clots. I was not asked at the first jab!!
357	201681	Last week Saturday, I got the first of two doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. I made two videos to highlight how I felt 17 and 27 hours after the first shot (it wasn't bad at all!). In two weeks, I plan to make some more videos to talk about what it's like.
358	105356	@DaniloDusoswa Not in the least, if it keeps us all safe then long may it stay, I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones who hasn‚Äôt lost anyone to this disease, and until there‚Äôs a vaccine then we just all have to adapt to our new way of life COVID19
359	106229	This is still less effective than the vaccine and you only take it if you test positive for Covid. This isn‚Äôt a substitute for the vaccine.
360	105283	Getting the vaccine is like wearing a seatbelt, it doesn't stop and accident, but it protects you! Lets get #coronavirus #VaccinesWork behind us!
361	106913	Uh...yeah. This is why anyone who knows what they‚Äôre talking about has been saying there‚Äôs no vaccine coming ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. Rush into a vaccine and this is what happens.
362	106935	And don't use de-lousing shit either.Don't use bleach.And if you do, don't whine to the ER when you're dying.Get a vaccine if you're able to, and keep everyone safe.And no, VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM.If they did, Millenials would've had it only after their first MMR shot.
363	105235	Would you rather get COVID-19 or have a vaccine shot for COVID-19? #COVID19  #coronavirus #ChinaVirus #vaccine #COVID19Vaccine
364	106529	Please take the first vaccine available to you. Please do not socialize indoors. Please stay home if you are privileged enough to do so. Please mask and distance. Every individual, acting now, for the love of their community, can stop this from happening.
365	107266	I knew this would happen.Corruption is rampant.Tell me again how I need to rush out among a crowd of anti maskers &amp; expose myself to this virus, just so I can get a vaccine that has been deliberately ruined for political reasons.
366	106781	Once every adult who wants the COVID-19 vaccine has had an opportunity to get it, the restrictions should all be lifted. Right?
367	107059	"If the coronavirus is so bad, such a threat, then how did my 77-yr old, bed ridden mother who has COPD &amp; is on oxygen 24 hours a day just survive it? She hasn't had &amp; will not have a ""vaccine"". @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow @TuckerCarlson @dbongino @WatchChad"

369	106449	The vaccine does not stop you from getting the virus!!! It protects you from getting a severe form of the disease. How is this so difficult to understand?
370	105599	Twitter locked my account and made me remove my tweet for saying that I have c*vid rn and my baby is completely unaffected - even according to my doctor my baby is/will be fine. And I am fine. Injecting an experimental vaccine esp. while you are pregnant is disturbing.
371	106141	@alina_garner @gitoma1 @sajidjavid @IndependentSage @CMO_England I dont see why it wouldn't become endemic, though if it drifts enough like the flu virus (unlikely), it may require yearly vaccine as it may effect those at higher risk endemic perhaps, but how long?

376	107093	You go out on a thrive and all your brasse recieved their Covid-19 vaccines, you chose not to. Fast forward, everyone catches covid yet they don‚Äôt get seriously ill. You on other hand are hooked up to a ventilator coz you chose to ignore the science.

Never have we had such a tyranny. Where will the evidence be that it will work? We have the flu vaccine but still have flu. The common cold, a coronavirus, can't pretend to a vaccine. Will there be one for C19 because it was man-made in the first place?
378	106035	The COVID-19 vaccine should tested on @OfficialPDPNig members first . If they survive the vaccine is safe , if they don't NIGERIA  is safe.  Thank you all .
379	105583	This is fundamentally the outcome of the commentariat deciding to disparage foreign vaccine programmes when it looked as if they may beat Britain too it. Once you begin undermining reality the genie can‚Äôt be put back in the box
380	107147	@rogertansey As harsh as this might sound.. triage is needed. If the older people come in with covid19 that chose not to take the vaccine don't treat them. Treat only the children that were not taken care of. They are the future. Can't fix stupid. They get to own it. They chose it.
381	107131	@KatalinTischha1 @alfgrowler @MorphingReality @richard_xxxx @ClarkeMicah We have been studying the aids virus for 30 years. We still cannot formulate a vaccine. This coronavirus has been around 6 months. We are in the foothills of discovery on the long term effects. If sustained exposure causes serious long term damage we will not know for months/yrs.
382	107492	@CNBCnow I'm curious as to if this drug works like a flu vaccine where if someone who has the coronavirus take this drug not only gets better, but also developed antibodies to the disease
383	106544	they should have mandated vaccines from day 1, in NY we‚Äôre mandated to be vaccinated in order to attend school, why can‚Äôt they just add the covid-19 vaccine to that list, the honor system was never going to work lmfao

388	107055	The only way Trump makes these coronavirus press conferences a positive is if he blows up Fauci and Birx for the frauds that they are. Bring in 100 doctors and have a true discussion about the virus. And forget about your vaccine. Otherwise, we‚Äôre back to where we started.
389	201598	@gillianlant @9NewsMelb Awesome seeing the first person to get their 3rd jab. Good on Roman &amp; I wish one of the members of VIctorian government witness that, like Scott Morrison did with the first ever Covid19 vaccine recipient.

396	106818	@Henrik_Palmgren I wonder if Ms Wu has heard of antibody dependent enhancement, the downfall of previous coronavirus vaccine attempts (SARS/MERS)? Having a more severe immune reaction on 2nd exposure isn‚Äôt necessarily the herald of a successful vaccine.

400	106104	The irony that a vaccine trial can be completed more quickly in the United States, because the pandemic is out of control in this country.  Scientists can get vaccine testing data rapidly.
401	107594	$GRTS We can‚Äôt keep getting booster shots every few months when a new variant appears. Outdated thinking and is akin to pulling up to a gas pump in a Tesla. Gritstone solves this.

404	107248	@AudreyManaster2 This is how the new vaccine will be produced, I think with changes in the coronavirus DNA genomes and why in some trials now they've been halted due to test human subjects having serious reactions. Why a rushed vaccine could have devastating effects. My assumption from readings.

412	105654	Not sure when/if I am getting my flu jab this year. Usually eligible due to asthma. Nothing on my GP website and NHS Scot only taking bookings for health care workers (using same portal as COVID-19 vaccinations). It‚Äôs important I get it so I can look after my baby properly.
413	106708	@AndrewMarr9 why is it taking so long to get the Novavax Covid19 vaccine approved, this excellent vaccine could ensure ample vaccines are available. The government has pre-ordered this vaccine, what‚Äôs the hold up? Ps I‚Äôm on the Novavax trial!
414	106516	They say that as if we aren‚Äôt used as pawns to reel our people in. 3-4 of their COVID-19 vaccine test subjects have already been diagnosed with Bell‚Äôs Palsy. It‚Äôs a no for me. Idc if every black person in the entire world took this vaccine, I would be the only one who didn‚Äôt.

416	107161	Okay, someone educate me now because what I just typed out makes sense to me, so I'm trying to figure out if the amount of push to get the vaccine has legitimate backing, or if it's going to be a short-term fix to COVID19 but the cause of something else that cripples us.

425	105923	Covid-19 vaccine has the ability to change your DNA. Be careful don't take it. Besides covid-19 has very low mortality rate. You can survive without any medication.
426	106721	Whoop there it is. #TheWhitehouse will determine the efficacy of the #coronavirus Vaccine according to Brian Morgantsen Deputy Whitehouse Press Secretary. If it's not @FDA fuhgetaboutit, no American is taking this Vaccine.
427	105704	@tedcruz Same way it makes sense that COVID-19 denialists like Marco Rubio get a vaccine first.Gitmo has guards.  They would not want COVID-19 to spread as it has in other prisons.
428	107532	This could be like letting a stranger drive you across the country, if that stranger got a driver's license 40 years ago but never drove a car after passing the exam.It's because people won't get vaxxed and take precautions during a global pandemic. Incredible.
429	201575	"It baffles me every time I hear my peers say ""I don't know what's in the vaccine so I'm not taking it"" My reply-- We've taken well over 7 vaccines since birth without knowing the composition, Covid-19 vaccine isn't any different. Get vaccinated joor!!"

432	105372	@USATODAY Viruses mutate.  That is why they have to tweak the flu vaccine every year.  That is why there is no vaccine for the common cold.  The #coronavirus is a cousin to these.  The Pfizer CEO may know this, that is why he sold Pfizer stock when their vaccine was announced.
433	106977	THAT is terrific since a vaccine will be useless against what is tantamount to a common cold. The Flu shot is just as useless (it made my husband sick for 6 months).  Save our tax dollars.!.!

435	105722	@NTVNewsNL @KellyAnneNTV Yeah I think I will sit this one out for while... You know.. to see what happens to the people who do take a rushed vaccine for a coronavirus where they cut safety and testing measures at every corner...

442	106832	This is very important.  It looks like we should be deploying vaccines around the world rather than boosting, for many good reasons
443	106263	Free testing for the Coronavirus. At my job. Hell no I will never trust a system That find it OK to shoot me but then want to save me with a vaccine. Something is not right here if you can‚Äôt protect me legally through bullets and guns are you going to save me with a vaccine

445	106702	When it comes to taking that vaccine, I'm in no rush to get it. I have to give it time.The vaccine is not a cure to covid19. There are medication out there which can cure the covid and they are been overlooked. Why is it so?There is something fishy about this vaccine.
446	106239	So basically we don't have vaccine for virus which is killed by hand sanitizer....Ironic isn't it üòÇüòÇ,@COVIDNewsByMIB #COVID__19 #coronavirus
447	107306	This is a two America‚Äôs moment. I would never do any of the things in this video but I‚Äôll take the vaccine tho
448	106318	Is it too late to join the vaccine race? How far are we into this bubble. Is there still money to be made or is it nearly done? Asking for a friend...
449	106267	We had the same evaluation in Canada a month or so ago. Canada, I believe, now has 5 vaccines approved, all with 100% efficacy against hospitalization, meaning it reduces the severity of the infection if you do get infected. In 79%, it prevents symptoms completely. Great news.
450	105374	@CDCgov @FatEmperor I don‚Äôt remember getting this advice before I had the flu vaccine. Is it perhaps because the COVID-19 vaccines have been hurried through a typical approval process and they don‚Äôt have enough data yet on how effective they truly are.
451	106759	If some of the countries are out hacking into other countries data to steal a covid19 vaccine, that would mean the stealer does not have a vaccine and if they claim they do, it mustn't work
452	106198	Notice they specify the words ‚Äòfully vaxed‚Äô so when they are talking about ‚Äòunvaxed‚Äô they are also referring to those who may have only had one shot or failed to get a booster. Hence ‚Äòunvaxed‚Äô is a large pool...
453	201761	My body my choice &amp;  my choice is no.  It's an unproven, untested vaccine no matter who made it and I'll be goddamned if it's going into my body. You want it go ahead, your body your choice.
454	106886	Just don‚Äôt take one.  Why take a vaccine for a virus that has a .03% death rate and that will only make Bill Gates richer.  THINK PEEPS!
455	107350	@cosmicdust911 @CatherineLugg @ASlavitt The reason we don‚Äôt have a vaccine for colds is because there are so many strains of cold viruses. We do have vaccines against certain coronaviruses already. This is one strain of coronavirus which makes a single vaccine much easier.

459	106431	This article is poorly written. There was absolutely no reason to say that they‚Äôre the poorest nation (as if that‚Äôs their fault???) and if you‚Äôre writing an article on how there‚Äôs no vaccines then focus on that. Why are you mentioning the other struggles of the country?
460	201756	I talked to my parents on the phone today. My mom was worried that if there will be a vaccine for COVID-19 then I should not get it because I‚Äôll die or get a ‚Äúmicro chip‚Äù under my skin. Also, my mom refuses to wear a mask because it damages the respiratory system.
461	107196	"@Louise86958858 @KorbelRenoKia @stacyhrae Covid vaccine started being developed after the SARS epidemic (also a firm of Coronavirus) . That's why it seemed ""fast"". They had all the groundwork done over the last 15 years."

463	201638	This morning after 7 AM got the vaccine, it‚Äôs 9:21 PM now and I feel like shit, I had a fairly high temperature and everything hurts. But I'll be fine! ü•¥#IGotVaccined #Vaccined #COVID19Vaccine #COVID19 #JohnsonAndJohnson #Poland https://t.co/zZZ5hI8w1J
464	105505	@tigheklory @stgenerations There are thousands of flu strains, they try to predict a few of out that and end up with 40% or higher success. Not too bad, but CoVid19 is a mutation of the SARS-CoV virus. Very different from the flu virus. The work on this vaccine started with work on SARS-Cov.
465	107467	@FionaMattatall I actually believe this faith in vaccines is a bit dangerous. Yes, they are important and yes, they will help us get back to some sort of normal life, but they won't eradicate Covid-19 completely and we'll still need to be careful.
466	106760	2 residents died in my mom's LTC home in the past week. Because workers allowed to choose not to get vaccine- 2 floors on lockdown, no activities, all isolated to rooms. Visits outside over. No way to live  @celliottability @drkieranmoore @fordnation @epdevilla @CBCNews

471	106677	My son's elementary school is requiring each student to choose between attending in person full-time, or making a commitment to distance learning for the entire school year, even if there's a vaccine in let's say, October!  My concerns are (1) coronavirus (2) education (3) work.
472	106514	Yeah, and that's why they (i.e. not US, but THEM) are having such a hard time replicating an effective vaccine? --These hominid scientists must be socially incentivized to make highly illogical statements, or are otherwise not properly thinking through the planetwide phenomena.

474	106689	üëâThis quick survey is for people working in care homes or social care.Researchers want to know the number of staff getting their flu jabs, which is already thought to be low.Knowing this (and why) could help more staff get their vaccines and reduce pressure from #COVID19.

476	107330	I will continue to repeat this: Covid deniers should not be vaccinated until everyone else has received the vaccine, especially hypocrites like Rubio.

480	106041	@mickschimp @GovPritzker Vaccines are particularly helpful for herd immunity but they take years to develop. Because COVID-19 is so new there is no herd immunity, because there is no immunity. Being exposed to the virus can be deadly so therefore it is best not to risk it. Period.

482	105339	@DaniellaCarlisi I get flu shot every year‚Äîno problems.  Am hesitant to get COVID-19 shot when it becomes available because it sounds as though Trump is rushing it to market without proper testing.  Wish there were a way to get a Canadian vaccine.

488	106483	There are many people out there can't take the COVID19 VACCINE because of their present health conditions....if they get the COVID19 VIRUS chances are they may not survive.
489	106259	@RealCandaceO I‚Äôm confused. If the right person/group created a vaccine, you wouldn‚Äôt take it if Covid-19 kept coming back? Do you get your flu shot? Havent you been critical of anti-vaxers before this? I‚Äôm generally curious no disrespect
490	201754	"Saying ""God will blow in my lungs again"" is just arrogant. A reasonable person of faith would thank the Almighty for the assist, then get the vaccine. #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS"
491	106725	Yes Selena Gomez is getting the covid-19 vaccine because she saw Britney Spears got it I'm going to keep an eye on her and make sure she is okay it won't even matter if she die because she will be still alive in my fantasies until I die
492	105558	this is extremely sad but people forget that vaccines protect you only about 95% from getting covid. you can still get covid. but it does give u 100% protection from it being deadly. doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt have painful symptoms. just to put it all in perspective.

494	105493	A shockingly high statistic, please RT, blood cancer patients need to know how effective the COVID vaccine is for them
495	107335	@hdevreij But hwo do they beat they the virus if not with particular antibodies ? @who .. the question is therefore  also vice versa .. People with no flu vaccine beat the flu too #COVID19  #coronavirus

497	106973	@KhamisuArt So let me explain it like this- with vaccines being preventatives, not cures. In other words, the vaccine will protect a person who receives it by lowering their chances of getting COVID-19 if they encounter the coronavirus.
498	107307	Fear not. Prolly we aint gonna have a choice about whether we get the coronavirus vaccine or not-because we are gonna hafta have an official government vaccine certificate on our phones to enter buildings, fly, shop, drive, have a bank account, buy anything, go out, have a job.
499	107589	If you think about it if your body can‚Äôt make antibodies against Covid-19 once you‚Äôve had it like they say then how is the vaccine 90% effective ? Cos don‚Äôt vaccines work by ur body making antibodies to a weakened version of the virus for when you get it properly ü§î
500	105982	That coronavirus vaccine is definitely going to be a requirement for school districts and colleges/universities. I dont know why this is even a debate when they ALREADY mandate that students have certain shots/vaccines at enrollment.
501	105448	Still don‚Äôt understand why I need a vaccine that has lower efficacy than my own immune system. 99% vs. 94%. Vaccine does not prevent transmission, so what is the purpose?
502	105791	if the COVID-19 vaccine is available to you why wouldn‚Äôt you get it? please explain your reasoning i am really trying to understand
503	105211	should I get da coronavirus vaccine and spend my weekend feeling like pure shit or should I wait and possibly get the coof
504	107602	üá®üá¶I wonder if a extra faster booster shot is needed after shot 2? All Governments seem to lag behind the science in my opinion. But, there is a problem with having enough for poor countries to even get shot 1. So, this is not good news. üëá

507	106234	@elzi0n engineering the body to produce coronavirus spike proteins like a Frankenstein mutation. To magically coerce anti-bodies when anti-bodies provided no such protection before, and will only reduce symptoms. based on faulty PCR. Is not a vaccine. It's fraud.

509	106214	need i remind you that coronavirus HAS been around and they‚Äôve been developing a vaccine for years now. this is just a different strand, so no they didn‚Äôt pull a vaccine out of thin air in 6 months.
510	107570	I don‚Äôt understand either. It is a mystery. I am fully vaccinated with booster and so are my three young kids. I was so relieved when they were eligible to get the vaccine.

556	105965	@DrTomFrieden How about Inate or crossimmunity. Like how cowpox cured smallpox and vaccinia is used in the smallpox vaccine. Three different strains of pox virus. So other coronavirus exposure could provide cross immunity to the covid one.

565	106342	@Polkameister I could see saying until COVID-19 has a vaccine loosening this as yes some will abuse it but we want to ensure anyone sick isn't coming to work to avoid spread, but making this permanent is nuts.  I think 5 sick days and anything beyond requires a doctor's note.
566	106743	@RichieRTR @conorsen Also, the reason why the flu vaccine is 46% effective is not really relevant here. Flu vx is partially a guesswork game about which new mutations will be prevalent in the coming year. That is not the case with covid-19 as it has very little evolutionary pressure.

573	105662	@marklevinshow I'm confused. Isn't COVID-19 a hoax? Why go to all this trouble to develop a vaccine, besides selling it as snake oil and getting filthy rich?
574	105987	If he rushes the vaccine and it is later proven to be ineffective, or worse, more people may die. There is a scientific method in place for a reason. Just hope scientists remain steadfast in their ethics and integrity.
575	107531	I dont go around u goofballs anyway and I will continue to wear my N 95 mask and 3 yrs from now when they running those commercials saying if u took any of those covid19 vaccine get on this lawsuit.  Guess what the government made it so u cant sue them folks.  So good luck
576	105630	You‚Äôre telling me I went the entire COVID-19 pandemic without so much as a sniffle but a week after my second vaccine I immediately get a sore throat and runny nose
577	105878	@RobbieTheFire There are over 60 strains of coronavirus that are mutating always. A vaccine is good for one strain, until it mutates. A vax is not 100% immunity. By the way where did all the flu cases go?
578	106664	When the coronavirus vaccine 8s created, BE CAREFUL!!!!Bill Gates is planning to use the vaccine to implant MICROCHIPS into every person on EarthDont be FOOLED by the government and corporations!!!!
579	107163	@awakenotwoke17 @FOX2News coronavirus is common in animals it‚Äôs why we could never become immune even if everyone was vaxxed or isolated themselves forever. You can get it from your own pets, now that fauci has made it easier for humans to get through his gain of function lab in wuhan
580	106831	@riseupmelbourne @AnonymousSage1 They know that from wearing mask the last several months that most sheep immune systems are going to be weak for the flu season and more people will be getting sick. They going to say it‚Äôs the new COVID-19 and you will need a vaccine to get rid of it.
581	201736	Not quite sure how one takes a cute selfie w/ their vaccine sticker, but here are my outtakes lol. Happy to do my part to stop the spread of #COVID19 by getting my 2nd dose of the #PfizerVaccine from @StormontVail.

584	201622	I have had an injection today ..... I don't know what it was and I will not know for the next 12 months. Either some normal saline, or the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine. I am proud to be a vaccine study participant (phase III).
585	105734	No vaccine is 100% effective....With so many vaccines in the market, this will be over before we know it
586	105670	Media from the right and the left will keep barking and creating fear on this insane #covid19 virus, this little virus that doesn‚Äôt do anything, they lie about hospitalization, we are going to a second lockdown. Vaccine will become mandatory , I hope fauci will will take it first
587	107259	"@KimIversenShow A coronavirus is a cold. There has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus prior to COVID-19. Have you ever heard the saying ""You can't cure the common cold?"" It's a scientific fact. Spike proteins block symptoms from surfacing. They do nothing for immunity."
588	107274	Of course China is their model. They need an economic collapse to implement the agenda.#COVID19 is already in Africa but e.g. Senegal are using #Hydroxychloroquine (from malaria stockpiles) so it's not a problem. Bill Gates just wants to test his vaccines there.
589	105432	@Notapedophile9 @EricZonaAZ @MrBeast When you get the shot you still get sick, it‚Äôs just like the flu shot the Covid-19 is not a death rate like the swine flu the swine flu killed more people then Covid-19 has so it‚Äôs this person‚Äôs choice to get the vaccine
590	106327	"The 'Chinese vaccine', 'Coronavirus' has already sickened the entire world. Mr. Trump cannot make America great again. If he could he would say, ""President Xi Jinping; you and your Communist Party cannot be trusted until you dissolve and adopt democracy"" (""Tear down this wall"")."
591	105309	This is going to become the norm on college campuses&amp; before u antivax ppl get your panties in a bunch, it is totally legal.  If u don't want the vaccine, u can still get your education, but you'll have to commute to &amp; from campus. It's a CHOICE. Isn't that what you're all about?
592	107573	@nytimes NO VACCINE CAN STOP THE VIRUS! NOTHING WILL!Why don't people get it? The only way for humanity to survive the most dominant organism on Earth is to go into permanent isolation. Anything less means extinction! #coronavirus
593	107007	. In any event, there is growing evidence that having caught #Covid19 does not give strong immunity (like the common cold, another #coronavirus.It is thought that a vaccine based on a mutated, but different, virus will give much stronger immunity.
594	106459	comparing the covid vaccine to falcon punch is like saying the vaccine takes 2 weeks to become effective and a chance it will cause me to immediately die (the vaccine is incredibly punishable)
595	201800	Mom and dad are fully vaccinated and have waited the appropriate amount of time post shot which meant we finally got to see them!!

609	201621	I received the Modern vaccine at work today. I was one of the first groups in our hospital to get the vaccine. We have next week to vacinate our entire staff and perhaps the following week. #CovidVaccine #ModernaVacccine #GetVaccinated #Moderna #WearAMask #COVID19 #StaySafe
610	105486	I don't understand why 6 out of 7 million would cause a pause. It's such a low %. Won't things like this lead to skepticism in a vaccine?
611	106956	The vaccine is free to all those in eligible groups. The NHS would never ask anyone for their bank details. They will be in touch when it is your turn to be vaccinated.
612	107582	How can they be recommending anything when there‚Äôs issues with these vaccines, i‚Äôm not anti-VAX I‚Äôm just anti-experimental VAX.  Get it right and then will think about taking it

616	106182	m-m-m maybe just m-m-maybe if only they make access to vaccines equal for all, including third world countries... oh wait... they d-d-d don't...?
617	106240	@ChildrensHD @silvano_trotta Let us not forget that if the bidding for a hypothetical vaccine is so excessive, there will be no holds barred. We are witness to the worst human vileness. They will do everything to enlist the people in their project. They are more dangerous than Covid19.
618	107285	Why is everyone excited about a #covid19 vaccine? Don't you realize that in the US, the very rich will get it, the very poor will get it thru Medicaid, but if you fall in between these, it will be unavailable or so costly nobody can afford it? They're estimating $2000/shot
619	105940	@NYCGRIFF Get a grip!!! Lockdowns and vaccine mandates don't work! Vaccinated still getting Covid19 and omicron etc. They don't want to be vaccinated then they take the chance they may die. I am vaccinated and still got Covid19 so don't blame everything on Desantis!

624	106396	Please before testing the new vaccine in Africa, tell us the relationship between HIV and polio vaccine, and why vaccines have always to be forced to Africans while we know they are a test. This time round Africa does not need Covid 19 vaccine, malaria has been killing more.....
625	107551	@ccpastormike @GovMikeDeWine @LtGovHusted @OHdeptofhealth @DrAmyActon @realDonaldTrump And when they realize there will be no vaccine, they need to give up on that idea. There's never been a vaccine for any coronavirus.

629	106572	@KMPHFOX26 Well we'll see about this I'm holding my breath we have not had any one in my immediate family catch the delta or the original covid-19 we're all vaccinated boostered up I'm just wondering if we're going to escape this time around too
630	107006	I got my first shot of covid-19 vaccine this morning. So far still good, there's nothing to be worry, except now I'm feeling sleepy &amp; hungry üòÅ
631	201698	I never got a flu vaccine until I realized how much safer it was for my grandparents, my father-in-law, and babies in my circle. Yes, I might only be a carrier, but they could have severe symptoms and even die. Covid is the same. Minnesotans look out for each other. #VaccinesWork
632	105661	If the PCR tests work-Why the false positives?If the masks work-Why the 6 feet?If 6 feet works-Why the masks?If all three work-Why the lockdowns?If all four work-Why the vaccine?If the vaccine is safe-Why the no liability clause?If Covid-19 exists- it not been isolated?
633	106488	@SurvivalGirl1 @NYCAIeks @NYGovCuomo Considering that I already stated  that the Coronavirus  strain is known as COVID-19, I am not suprised.When they formulate this vaccine  it will save myriad lives  because people's bodies will be able to develop antibodies as a prophylactic measure to make them resistant.  üòÅüëç
634	107075	@sunethagampodi Hope you clearly know that this is false as a doctor.Almost all the child deaths were in unfortunate kids with chronic illnesses who had low immunity anyway.On the other hand unlike MMR vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines don't prevent infections, it only has a minor mortality benefit.
635	201503	Got my second COVID-19 vaccine earlier today, outside of a faint headache and a dull pain in my shoulder I'm feeling pretty okay so far. Will have to wait two more days for any side effects to come out, just hoping it'll go as smooth as my first vaccination did. https://t.co/XFehNH97HZ
636	106607	@GOPLeader Trump didn‚Äôt take responsibility for the spread of COVID-19 so he doesn't now get to take credit for a vaccine.

638	107201	@Armandozim @ToddCoo72170990 @LinaHidalgoTX Well actually the other end is not working.... Why do you think cdc is no longer tracking breakthrough covid-19 cases they don't want you to know the truth vaccine are not working
639	106518	So I‚Äôve been offered a job as a care assistant (my third dream job ü•≤) but also they‚Äôve said that they can‚Äôt promise me that I don‚Äôt lose that job in the future if I don‚Äôt get the vaccine. üòì I totally understand that and thanked them for the offer. Goodbye my dream job. #COVID19
640	105913	So my girlfriend got her #COVID19 vaccine #ShotNo1 she's kinda felt #FluLike for a couple days. I just have a headache and my arm is sore lol
641	107179	Family being sick is always sad. This girl doesn't believe in vaccines but will take mother with kidney cancer to hospital to get chemo therapy? I doubt this family would be pleased to be taken to a hospital where doctors #DoNotComply and let anyone go up and down and do whatever
642	106848	Here‚Äôs a contrast. Yesterday, spoke with someone in Arizona ‚Äúreluctant‚Äù to get her #COVID19 vaccine. Why? Conspiracy theories. Today, a friend in #India who desperately wants a vaccine for her son said they can‚Äôt get it. We don‚Äôt realize how privileged we are in the US. Shameful.
643	105840	JUST IN - U.S. Army: Soldiers who refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine will be immediately discharged, Reuters reports.
644	105403	I signed up for initial vaccine testing (wasn't chosen), but this is a responsible position. #ncpol #NCSenateDebate #ncsen
645	107508	Aren‚Äôt republicans needing help to feed their families? Don‚Äôt they want to receive the vaccine? Aren‚Äôt they Americans? So sad they are divided.
646	106258	No way!. Research the vaccines. Amazing how bad it is. Why take it? I don't trust government information!
647	107549	Even finding a covid-19 vaccine won‚Äôt be enough to end the pandemicLimited supplies could create coronavirus haves and have-nots around the globe once a vaccine is manufactured
648	107501	This is really just a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the disabled and immune compromised ppl like myself‚Ä¶I have my vaccine, I have my booster and I‚Äôm abt to get another‚Ä¶but without a plan in place getting COVID-19 is fatal for me and for many others.

650	105591	my dad is leading the research and development on a coronavirus vaccine and i just sat on a bong water wet spot on my computer chair and had a panic attack
651	106864	@PoliticsForAlI If @UKLabour oppose vaccine passports and they fail to get through parliament, and if they begin to actually oppose the Coronavirus legislation then I think many of us might even consider voting for them again, having ditched them years ago. @EssexPR?You reading, @Keir_Starmer?
652	106703	Trump's latest is to say every American will get coronavirus vaccine by April. Trump the scientist? Trump the drug manufacturer? We can't get enough paper towels or onion powder in our grocery stores! Flu vaccines run out every year even though the population no. is known.
653	106026	I want details-I have RA, I take methotrexate, and I‚Äôm still an ICU RN. But does this make sense without antibody testing, with unvaxxed coworkers, and so many places in the world without enough vaccines? Like I don‚Äôt even know what is fair or right.
654	107142	@crbarnes001 If someone's has had the so-called vaccine they will probably get a positive test result. But you will never really know the truth as to if she had a virus or not because post-mortem and coroners have been banned for anyone registered as a covid-19 death.
655	105571	So glad they accept the Docket App for the vaccine proof. Easy to use and has all the information needed
656	107672	@MinistryofTru16 @LibertyTre3 @TheFutureLover @McAuleyATL @kenklippenstein @EconCircus @KilldozerSZN Is the US not also producing the largest opioid crisis in history? Meanwhile the UK has provided key research for the coronavirus vaccine. Both are good systems, but to say the US is currently superior because of pure output isn‚Äôt something I agree with.
657	106453	What an idiot  this guy @prageru @DennisPrager . Where would we be in this country if horrible people like Prager had obstructed polio vaccine like they do #COVID ? Dead. Or crippled . That‚Äôs where
658	106161	"I listened, but I still can't actually believe what I heard..!The MINISTER FOR HEALTH says it's called ""COVID-19"" because there were 18 other coronaviruses before this one?And developing a vaccine will be difficult because they weren't successful with any of the previous 18?üôä"
659	106888	How is it possible that healthy people must be forced to isolate, not work, then not get paid cus they have come into contact with a likely vaccinated, testing, app loving , mask wearing person who can still pass it on and should be safe cus they are jabbed?

662	106136	Very stressful fews days helping to order in and set up the track and trace process for the Covid vaccine. Happy to see patients start to receive the vaccine, and proud to play a part in the first person in the world to receive it.
663	106443	@Lesliiiemarie so the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is made then what? i never took a flu shot before. so it‚Äôll be mandatory for everyone in the united states of america possibly the world to take the covid19 vaccine to be safe. ever wondered how many deaths a day from the flu?
664	107650	Kill me now. Waiting for a vaccine is pure idiocy and has zero scientific basis. There has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus, and it would be at best 30% effective, like a flu vaccine. It's a mutating virus. It's completely insane.
665	106282	@sunnydayrealaf @JamesonHook @KyleKulinski Actually, it‚Äôs something to do funds for a vaccine is why there is delay but with Covid-19 it‚Äôs impacted nearly everyone and the rich were or are losing money without workers to do their work. Funds has become available for Covid-19 because the economy was tanking
666	107468	This is why they are protesting,Why everyone else is not being denied American Covid-19 Vaccines &amp; these ppl in need, 90 miles away from Florida are not getting any aid?Wow...

668	105994	Coronavirus is FAKE NEWS because the government is pretending people are sick because they want to give everyone a vaccine that makes you sick because something something 5G Bill Gates another double vodka please Davy now that brings me to microchips...
669	105753	@252ALLMZ @deelightfulEP @Cleavon_MD @alaskarebel If you legitimately care to understand how the mRNA covid-19 vaccine safely works to build immunity without a killed virus, I‚Äôm happy to take the time to explain it all.  If you‚Äôre just an AV peddler of known lies, I hope no one ignorant to science or basic facts is exposed 2u.
670	105349	I love how this guy apparently has a knob somewhere he can just turn whenever he wants to give out more vaccine.If this number is so easily adjustable, cut the bullshit &amp; just send it all.A news article announcing the increase makes you look a like a douche who's holding out.
671	105202	W T F???  Lol.  Why would anyone want a vaccine with a 99.7% survival rate?  Not to mention you get a vaccine and still must follow the draconian, nonsensical mask nonsense.üôÑ.  Yeah I‚Äôll pass.
672	105476	YET AGAIN!!!! Force us home &amp; require everyone that isn‚Äôt allergic to the vaccine to get it before they can work. Cause this is just stupid.
673	106747	A 90% effective vaccine that will deal with 20 or so mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes the COVID-19 disease) is coming.  If offered, will you take it?
674	105618	@kman_blac @TheTNHoller @tnhousegop This is a novel coronavirus. Meaning they‚Äôve never seen a virus like it before. Science takes time. The polio vaccine took decades to get right. It is a series of 4 shots giving to infants. We are at three shots now, 4 in Israel. It‚Äôs proven to save lives. Why fight it? #Science
675	106949	@DonnellyStephen On Pat Kenny talking about a vaccine passport? How come we don‚Äôt need one for measles? If you‚Äôre vaccinated surely it doesn‚Äôt matter then if I am? You‚Äôre an idiot! #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #lockdown2021
676	105286	Here‚Äôs one for any virologists/immunologists out there: if this Indian #Covid variant can partially evade antibodies of vaccinated people, will this not be an immediate catalyst for mutations which make it *completely* immune to the vaccines? How does this ever end?#COVID19

689	105206	@dkdmac ‚ÄòMyth: The COVID-19 vaccines don't work because you can still get COVID after vaccination.Fact: COVID-19 vaccination will protect most people from getting sick with COVID-19, ranging from 66% to 100% effective.‚ÄôI think it‚Äôs clear that is not true. Everyone is still getting it.

692	105371	@superdupergrump @MollyJongFast Fwiw I'm not some anti vaxxer. I get all my Dr reccd vaccines. How CV19 evolves is an unknown at this point. It could very well end up being like other coronavirus that aren't so much as deadly, as they are just an annual nuisance.
693	106271	@HelenBranswell @mariojoze EPIC is a problematic format 4 vaccine information, since EPIC was 1st developed as a billing system. QR codes are an elitist tool - many hv no smartphones. Better example is California's Blue Shield and Kaiser Permanente partnership in the CA COVID-19 vaccine rollout this year.
694	106036	Nice this is going to be @JoeBiden, Rioting and Looting with no recourse, send the vaccine to Iran and China before we give it to our own vulnerable people.  @joeb is a National Disgrace #BidenCrimeFamilyExposed #BidenCrimeFamily
695	105551	Vaccine maniacs say, well you took medicine for cancer so why don‚Äôt you just take the vaccine? I did due diligence on specific treatments and my doctors gave me the choice, never a mandate. I chose integrative treatments, natural and pharma, but it was my choice. #COVID19

710	107281	They should first prove to us that this vaccine is actually going to be a vaccine.&amp;that it will be to help reduce the symptoms of Covid19. If they are able to prove these two points,then people should take it.Yet just an experiment with vaccine is likely to yield few good results
711	106030	I don't understand why this is being promoted.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  This is not optics.  It's not strategic. It's not even coherent given the spotligbt on HQ and UV light therapy.#novaccines

716	105465	@QuintonLucasKC Why are people even discussing this. The common cold is a coronavirus and there has never been a successful vaccine or cure or even treatment for it. Covid-19 is a much more complex cv so it will not happen. Accept it. And if they do get one the virus will mutate making it void

728	105629	ok idk anything about this but why is CV19 research not just open source? wouldn't we be finding a vaccine quicker and then be able to manufacture it quicker?
729	105622	Many unknowns with one constant: Herd Immunity seems to be the only answer against the #PandemicCovid19, but how we achieve it differs. Vaccine or enough people get infected.
730	105907	Bottom line...until they come out with a vaccine for COVID19 and it's free, I'm most likely not going back to any kind of regular job dealing with the public. Certain controlled circumstances with trusted people, maybe. But the job world is fucked up right now.
731	105867	He tested negative and still has to sit. It's an insanely dumb rule. But, getting the vaccine isn't a big deal and he could have avoided these stupid rules but decided to risk it.
732	105475	@Noahpinion @NoahCRothman IIRC Chinavax was made with A coronavirus, not THE covid-19 because they were trying to beat everyone to market for prestige.They did. But it's not a covid vaccine and it doesn't protect like one.

741	106184	I know everyone is a bit nervous about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. I got mine today at 1026. I did it for my mom, my family, my friends, and my patients. I was a bit sentimental and cried because of those patients we lost despite everything we did. This was especially for them.
742	106481	when/if they come out with a covid-19 vaccine, will you be getting it or are you skeptical about the motives/agenda and decline the vaccine? ü§î
743	106948	You think they will tell you if the vaccine is safe for you before you take it? What about me? Better yet what about my kids? Will they be forced to take something made to kill them? You think something is wrong with me now let something happen to one of my kids. Life changing.
744	105627	I just got another nutty email about my column from Friday.  One of his crazy conspiracy theories is that Bill Gates refused the Covid vaccine because he's in the know and feels it's too dangerous.I don't have the heart to send this back to the person.
745	105673	@JamesDesmond99 @KerryAnnSmith1 As I keep pluggingCovid19 has no loyalty to any Political Party or Person.It only understands the Absolute state of the art, latest most science driven solutions until a workable safe vaccine arrives.Period.
746	201640	@FrancyDias9 ‚úãyou bet i am wearing one in public. Plus vaccinated and a booster.  My sister died of covid19 before the vac. Came to the west coast.
747	105889	@leenorman54 The CMO said it is inevitable that everyone will get coronavirus over the next few years, just like the common cold that goes around and around. A vaccine may stop it, but that's a way off.
748	105381	So covid-19 antibodies may sometimes also respond to human proteins, causing autoimmune issues. The vaccines use the same protein to trigger the immune response, so may cause similar responses. This possibility is supported by an increased incidence of anaphylaxis
749	106670	@WhiteHouse @DeborahBirx How far away is a vaccine? Or information on why COVID-19 mutates so fast? Or what can slow it down once it enters lungs
750	201798	First it was take any shot you can get‚Ä¶so I took AZ‚Ä¶.then it evolved to take any shot you can get but not AZ so I took Moderna‚Ä¶.by the time I get to the booster will they be flat out giving only Pfizer?
751	106094	So Today, Moderna is leading the pack to develop a new vaccine for the SARS-coronavirus?  I guess it helps if you've been working on it a year before it happened.Such geniuses at Moderna!! How could they possibly know a SARS-coronavirus pandemic would come only 1 year later?
752	105240	This is how pharma companies make their money. It is not with a once a year vaccine it is the once-a-month, week, or day drug they push on you. The covid drug will become something you will need to take monthly, weekly, or even daily. Are you freakin awake yet!!!

755	105553	@philhowells @chrischirp The fact you have had two jabs and still got it is very revealing.My hunch is now, if you are ok and clear it, you will not catch it again this year and if you do next year, it will feel the same as a more common coronavirus cold.

762	105774	@zchagla It's a coronavirus. They can form part of the answer, but utter obsession in vaccinating the whole population with a vaccine that only has emergency use authorisation is downright odd. More so when in relation to those who are not vulnerable to the disease itself.

777	201685	@ryanfield The vaccine is just a money maker for Pfizer and it doesn't eradicate the virus and because it doesn't the shot will have to be updated and given at least four times of year. I get COVID-19 at this point it's like getting a cold because I've had 3 shots. I've had enough.
778	106370	A vaccine may never come.None came for HIV.We MAY die if we re-open for business, yes. But, we WILL die if we stay locked down too long. Living has risks. Which do you choose?

797	107121	I think it might not come such a time in my view. Once a pandemic it remains in circulation as long as transmission patterns don't change. We need WHO, CDC and all players to come up with vaccine as we adhere to containment measures given by MOH. Likewise, we commit it to God.

806	105316	Nope. My shelves are not empty like this ANY WHERE in my state. Are a few items low on stock? Sure because we have been dealing with an on-going pandemic where people stupid people are refusing to get vaxxed or wear masks.Did you talk abou that part?
807	201522	Got my vaccine today as part of the oxford COVID-19 vaccine trial. Don't know which one it was, quick, efficient and painless... #VaccinesWork #vaccines #VaccineTrials #vaccinessavelives #puttingmymoneywheremymouthis https://t.co/zkStnji5Ix

809	106545	Why get an experimental #vaccinated if we just have to mask up and isolate again??That‚Äôs stupid.#Democrats can‚Äôt have it both ways. They can‚Äôt beg us to get the #CovidVaccine and then act like the vaccine does no good.#LiberalHypocrisy #FearMongering #JoeBiden #COVID19
810	106471	@JoeBiden God save us, Binden wins. He is on the side of China and against America. China has the coronavirus vaccine, so it did not spread to other cities and no politician got sick.
811	106476	@Deus_Abscondis @JeanmarcBenoit @KoenSwinkels Hence why there's never been a vaccine for a coronavirus, or other highly mutations viruses like HIV.Mutations will never stop with a leaky vaccine.So what's the end game?
812	105751	@pandauxUK @westoneuler @brittany_broski @EmmaLangevinXO Youll never stop the spread of coronavirus. The only thing you can do is prevent the overwhelming of the hospital system. The flu has a vaccine and comes back every single year. Coronavirus will be apart of life forever now. We just have to find a way to get back to normal
813	105775	My 6yo grandson tested + and can‚Äôt visit so although I‚Äôm vaxxed but immune compromised it‚Äôs back to self isolation.  Thanks #DeathSantis
814	105852	@dfi_playah @OCASMv2 @M_Phatical @IcicleThieves @BretWeinstein You‚Äôre trying to tell me a a vaccine made for the original Covid-19 virus may not be as effective at preventing disease in the 5th variant to be reported as concerning that is highly mutated üò± who would‚Äôve thought. Why do you think they make a new flu vaccine each year?
815	105384	So it has come to my attention that in my clip from the movie @MedicatingNorm1 involving @kellybroganmd and it turns out this person is Anti-Vax. Make no mistake Vaccines save lives. Coronavirus is real and unfortunately I made a mistake by not doing a google search.
816	105785	And further.  I am tired of being treated and spoken to as if I am a disease, because I live in Toronto.  I do not live my life as if getting rid of Covid19/21 is my primary goal in life. Neither do I live my life waiting for some miraculous vaccine.  There is a life to live.
817	107213	I will not take the vaccine bc @BillGates is involved &amp; wants to put a micro nano-chip in the vaccine. The govt would have to guarantee they did not put anything in the vaccine.
818	105439	There will always be another variant. Fear controls; we proved it for them last year. Why are they pushing this one experimental vaccine when they never have before? So much so they are 'free'?#ImpeachBidenHarris#CovidFarce #FireFauci
819	106617	Hopefully, sooner, but we'll see, but wanted to apologize as this is the last thing I wanted today. The good news is, my arm is good, just my nose feels like my grandfather's trumpet once used. Stay safe and be careful everyone.#COVID19 #Booster #Allergies #TheBoxingTruth

918	107668	If you take this vaccine you are a total fool. Even Bill Gates said a Coronavirus vaccine will kill 700k+ each year taken. This is a cull. The biggest fear is we become herd immune to it. They are rushing the real killer this vaccine ASAP.
919	106455	@chridano @thejuraisout @DanHitchings @VancityReynolds @jessicamalaty Nope! Covid19 is a strain of coronavirus called SARS‚ÄëCoV‚Äë2. Researchers have been working on a generic vaccine for SARS viruses for years. They were able to build on that research. Because Covid is so infectious and has spread so quickly, they have been able to test widely.
920	106784	Sad to say, @AviBittMD, you did just miss out this whole time. I noticed it way back in Nov 2020. Bolt out of bright blue in my home country. Global scourge. But #ivermectin could work against it as #antisemites are loathsome creatures and also parasites. #COVID19 #vaccines
921	107480	@bennyjohnson @tedcruz China is weaponizing viruses and covid-19 has been a test.  It crashed the entire world economies so to then it's a success.  Oh and by the way, they now have a vaccine and my guess is the upper echelons of their government had it for months.
922	105969	With several companies rolling out their coronavirus vaccines what‚Äôs the difference between them? Our @MattGregoryNews has the answer #GetUpDC #Verify
923	106135	Even though I will am in one of the last groups to be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, I won't be trying to jump ahead.I do worry there won't be any by the time they get to my group, but am hopeful they will have figured out the manufacture &amp; distribution problems by then.
924	105359	There is no way to know that in two weeks. Also if it turns out to be 'no' just like with delta we can still expect the jab to be shoved down our throats. Calling it now, they will say only the 'boosted' are protected

931	107023	@likeitor_lumpit @realDonaldTrump We have a flu vaccine, yes people do die but the way it spreads is not as easily as the corona. We have never seen one person in a nursing care facility get the flu and the whole facility end up with it in a months time! And this is the facts of COVID19.
932	106962	@Pepe__J All that I can figure is they wanted to scoop up the rest of the BioNTech, Covid-19 vaccine.  Rumor has it there is a new FDA approved formula.
933	105496	When are nursing facilities going to stop this? WHEN? It's ridiculous. No vaccine, no job. How stupid can people be?

935	106023	@WVCatholicRadio @CatholicAwesome That's also how Saber looks when you don't get the Covid-19 vaccine because you believe lies and misinformation

942	106875	Did anyone point out to the idiot #PresidentTrump that #WarpSpeed is a pure fictional term. But then that dies fit what he wants to do, create a #vaccine in 6 months. Pure fiction, promise ANYTHING for sake of #November2020
943	106645	@realDonaldTrump You are saying the ful and Covid-19 are the same really. Their is a vaccine for the flu,where is the vaccine for Covid-19. There is no safe vaccine to use but they are still trying to find one. Thousands of people dying everyday and you come up with something stupid to say.
944	105269	@ASlavitt Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
945	107411	Close to home for us. Please vote in @nicolergalloway for Governor of Missouri.We are well past needing a statewide mask mandate.There will be nothing approaching normal until we first get this under control, then develop a safe and effective vaccine.We don't need a quick one.

947	105872	I got some good news for everyone, they have found a vaccine for coronavirus but they are doing some final checks on it apparently they should be giving it out at christmas for the vulnerable first, so fingers crossed 2021 will be back to normal üò¨üëç
948	107610	@Ms_Michelle_Roy @MarkFriesen08 It's not a vaccine. mRNA is a medical device. It makes you produce viral proteins for what is suspected to be Covid-19 as we do not have this virus isolated and cultured. If we did, we would have an actual vaccine for it. Not going to risk an autoimmune issue like Cytokine Storm.
949	201749	I‚Äôm over 50 and trying to make an appointment for my COVID-19 vaccine but the ACT booking line is overwhelmed and their online booking system won‚Äôt accept my Medicare number. At a later attempt told I was 96th in the queue on the phone. Not a lot of vaccine hesitancy here.
950	106828	So if the so called vaccine for covid19 fails or leads to more deaths do u think the rest of the world will find out about it? I know they didn't talk about the failed 1 in Brasil something to think about.
951	106292	What is it all about. I'm talking about the sudden spike in Coronavirus all round the world. Quite convenient don't you think. It's a good job we have a vaccine waiting to save the planet. If you are the one waiting for a vaccine   I wish you well, you may just need it...
952	105798	Why is Bill Gates so pro-vaccine? Is any other rich billionaire donating so many millions of dollars towards a vaccine!? ü§î
953	106278	Making a vaccine for Coronavirus is not as complicated as making one for AIDS or cancer. It is in the same family as the flu and other Covid viruses. They make a new flu shot every year to predict which strain will be most prominent. This is why the C19 vaccine was made so quick
954	106934	@DrTomFrieden How come none of those vaccines made it to market?  This is not like other coronavirus, just going to ignore that particular issue?
955	105440	@GOP keep promoting the anti-vaccine silliness. Is wearing you and your followers down slowly but surely. Blame Trump for downplaying the virus and running off to play golf, only to eventually get his shots, never to confirm it. No sympathy if you play with fire, and get burnt.
956	106421	Remember in May, when Trump said the coronavirus is ‚Äúgoing to go away without a vaccine ‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time‚Äù ?
957	105306	Before kids go back to SCHOOL THEY NEEDED VACCINES OR THEY would get FINDED So What's the difference you don't treated me LIKE trash and kill me and your own people
958	105555	Cuba has a large biotech sector and has to be self sufficient because of the U.S. trade embargo and sanctions.  Cuba üá®üá∫ developed its own vaccine and has a history of distributing it too other countries like Pakistan. #Covid19
959	105268	This is why the answer can‚Äôt be rushed. A vaccine will be developed but don‚Äôt rush and cut corners to try and get there.
960	105519	A career in my field, financial stability, my student loans paid off, and a vaccine for Covid-19 would be nice.
961	107282	@wane15 Nobody is applying is why.  This whole $15 minimum wage an hour mentality has destroyed the balance.  Also Covid-19 welfare checks too. I as many were making $900 plus a week setting home off work playing video games. It‚Äôs going to be much worse if vaccine mandates are imposed.
962	107354	Yes, I am going to get my mouse friend vaccinated but I‚Äôm certainly going to monitor little RatFace for a few weeks before I take take the Kamala vaccine.
963	105708	These vaccines are not worth the side effects that are happening I for one am not going to take that chance I've had Bell's Palsy I still do to an extent and it's bad people it's bad
964	201694	Well this is ironic.  Mum‚Äôs just had a letter offering her a #COVID19 jab because she‚Äôs my ‚Äòcarer‚Äô, but I haven‚Äôt received my letter.How odd.
965	106408	@JordanSchachtel If you're getting the annual flu shot, you're getting boosters for the ongoing Swine Flu, which is now endemic... as is COVID19.  If they'd just be up front about how COVID is acting like a normal flu... no.... no, we can't have that. No money in it. Not enough fear.

977	107509	80% (or as close as we can get) vaccine coverage and rolling booster shots (like we do with flu) and I'll accept we need to move on. Until then we're just accepting unnecessary death.  Restrictions can't last forever which is why we need to ramp up vaccines globally.
978	105679	Not convinced this is safe until we have a vaccine for Covid-19 as being stuck in a crowded train will spread the virus big time especially if someone doesn't wear a mask and has it even if they don't know they're infected
979	106801	See how when the vaccines started to roll out in March and April the spread went down üòÉNow see how there‚Äôs a big population that doesn‚Äôt like it and it‚Äôs all worse How does that logic work someone explain it to me how do you see it get better and say it‚Äôs bad

1036	107138	i‚Äôve made it so far without catching covid why can‚Äôt we just stay home until numbers are down and vaccines are out..
1037	107406	Don't vote for this punk !!!Vaccine passports pave the way to Chayna Social Credit SystemOnly PPC will oppose this

1039	106512	Absolutely TERRIFYING and EXACTLY why I will NEVER EVER get a Coronavirus vaccine--even if someone PAID ME!!!!
1040	107190	The roll out of the first approved #COVID19 vaccine today is remarkable. We owe every single person involved in this national effort a huge debt of gratitude.The work continues for our NHS - first in the world to start vaccinating - and for those in research and manufacturing.
1041	105336	I‚Äôve noticed that many don‚Äôt even know the Purpose of taking vaccine hence they are celebrating,cause President Cyril Ramaphosa has Covid-19 Advice,do abit of research about vaccine before you start dancing or celebrating ignorance üòÇSAD
1042	201669	On 5 th May, I got my first dose of Covid-19 vaccination at Capital Hospital Bhubaneswar. And, i would like to thank our @bmc_bbsr for smooth execution of the vaccine drive. Also,I truly appreciate the @CMO_Odisha
1043	107648	I think the whole world needs to come together on this and share information, instead of just trying to make money off a vaccine. But what do I know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è?
1044	201571	If I beat covid why‚Äôd I get the vaccine my immune system strong asf if the virus so deadly. My immune system like Jordan n the fourth of game 7 n a nba finals a beast! #FUKTHEVACCINE
1045	107530	Just scheduled my vaccine appointment... considering every conceivable facet of my life improved during the COVID-19 pandemic but a Job-like litany of horrors has begun accumulating the past three weeks I fear I have signed my death warrant
1046	106268	I think these seems like a good idea. US is in a bad shape right now with coronavirus and if a vaccine produces 95% success rate, it wouldn't be a bad idea to start testing it in America.
1047	106756	@Dr_Ellie @nadhimzahawi @NHSuk @PHE_uk @KnightAyton @BarneyCalman @EveSimmns @DrNeilStone @BBCBreakfast @thismorning @TomSwarbrick1 Not getting a sticker was the biggest (and only) disappointment when I got both of my COVID-19 vaccines. I only hope my borough rectify this injustice before I get my booster jab üòÇ
1048	201501	Odd, i do all of those things without having had the covid vaccine. I guess Ill still have to wait for someone to give me a good reason to take this vaccine ü§î
1049	201530	üò±Buckle up people. I have a feeling covid-19 was just flexing it's muscles in 2020. Makes me wonder, will the vaccine still work?
1050	106946	@hilaryluros We SO need a Vaccine for: #GaslitTrumpersPerhaps our heroic worldwide scientists can get that out as soon as they have one for the:#CoronaVirus üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº
1051	105700	@ShapersJaipur @UNICEFIndia @YuWaahIndia @RajCMO @RajGovOfficial One of the most heard misconception is that coronavirus vaccine is dangerous because it will inject the virus into our bodies, and that is the main reason why so many people are getting affected from it.#covidsupportrajasthan #RajYouthFightCOVID @UNICEF @UNICEFIndia
1052	105348	@NYGovCuomo When can we call for to RESIGN!!!! You had months to prepare for the Covid-19 Vaccine, but kept saying there was NO WAY President Trump was going to get it done &amp; if he did you would not accept it!!! Stop double talking the public.
1053	105303	@AlisonWordsmith I hope you‚Äôre right, but since there has never been an efficacious and safe coronavirus vaccine for humans, I‚Äôm very doubtful. I think herd immunity is going to have to come from infection, and hopefully mutations make it less dangerous over time. I hope to be wrong
1054	106031	"@Duke_Libertas @JLR59749237 @amlivemon Who is they? And moving what goalposts? A coronavirus vaccine was never gonna be 100% effective like a measles vaccine is. First generation vaccines rarely are.The point of a vaccine is to get enough immunity to ""flatten the curve"" w/less social distancing. That's it."
1055	105552	Getting pretty bored üòê nothing to do but to watch television and also sometimes go to the store like Walmart or Bi-Mart really good to get out and instead of being stuck in the house or apartment I just hope that this coronavirus will be over and when a vaccine be available
1056	105481	@harrylitman What an idiot!! The vaccine does not prevent you from getting COVID-19 and it didn't stop you giving it to somebody else. Why on earth would you want to force people to take the vaccine?
1057	106755	can you believe because of Trump/GOP (same anti-maskers pushing others out of the way to get the vaccine even though they have the CHOICE to socially distance + Mask) the US is going retrograde to 1918 ????
1058	106658	#COVID19 So if the first #vaccines are free then in 8 months are they charging ? If you want to stay covid free how much will it cost for a lifetime?
1059	107115	There is no vaccine yet for COVID19, I don‚Äôt understand what exactly people think will be different ‚ÄúWe waited long enough‚Äù ‚Äîdo you think that time just magically makes this go away? Like it‚Äôll just stop being super contagious because enough time passed? It‚Äôs still circulating.
1060	106442	CALLED IT!!Now.  Taking odds that if Biden wins wonderfully magical the vaccine will be so good for we will lace it in food.
1061	105532	@BCook1978 @chuckwooten @Gangsta_Gumby @GovMikeDeWine Apples to Oranges? Tell me when FLU vaccine has been taken and the person has not got the FLU. Literally everyone I personally know that takes that vaccine every year still gets the flu. So no, it is not apples to oranges. Do you research. Covid-19 vaccine was patented years ago
1062	106859	There are costs incurred with our without a vaccine registry.    The more accurate question is if the cost is greater when we don't keep track. This has been a long-pursued goal of public health for decades.  #COVID19 represents the current pressing need.  There will be others.
1063	107621	Covid-19 is in every corner of this world, we need to work together to get rid of this pandemic. Mask up, sanitize and if you get a chance to a vaccine, take one.
1064	107110	My black ass has hereditary PTSD from that time our government pulled that Tuskegee bullshit. I‚Äôm going to pass on the vaccine in the beginning and see how it pans out. Am I being dramatic? Maybe. Better safe than sorry. #COVID19 #vaccine #tuskagee #BidenHarris2020
1065	201720	Thankfully I didn‚Äôt get COVID-19 during this pandemic. But I‚Äôm 90% sure my job is going to require the vaccine by the fall. It literally makes my job easier with the travel aspects üôÑüôÉüòí
1066	105767	Going back to school tomorrow with an N95 mask on my face. I already know of three colleagues who won‚Äôt be there because they have symptomatic Covid despite boosters. May the odds be ever in your favor my friends. #teachers #covid19
1067	105925	@GoFlyers73 @Genoxy_Official @AurelionBro @iiiTsJoeTime @POTUS Is there any step skipped in coronavirus vaccine development compared to a traditional vaccine?
1068	105402	"@NateSilver538 ""Vaccine EQUITY?"" Smh, let me guess, not only is coronavirus racist, but now the vaccine is too?"
1069	105248	@ReopenNZProtest Don‚Äôt worry. There is NO risk from Covid19 vaccinations :)  - Covid19 is so dangerous, China just tested every single person in Wuhan, millions of tests in 10 days. They are going for eradication. China has the most experience with Covid19. I don‚Äôt think there will be a vaccine..
1070	106681	If you are thinking that once a vaccine is developed this will all go away, consider testing:A test was developed in January. In March Trump promised on-demand testing, including an app for easy implementation.In Sept Herbert promised on-demand testing for Utahns. Today:
1071	105803	@Coronavirusgoo1 @Bringon2021Kona @DanielB220201 I think the Oxford one will eventually end up being our prime one.. they were streets ahead of everyone else developing a vaccine in the first place having already partially had one in production for a similar Coronavirus meant to tackle another strain in Africa.
1072	201562	Walked in to @cvspharmacy for my second Moderns shot yesterday. Didn't make an appt, bring my insurance card, or bring my #COVID19 vaccine card, and they still got me the shot. #NoExcuses
1073	106561	But they‚Äôre not getting the real vaccine! This is the biggest lie that will befall on the American people! Do not trust the Deep State!
1074	106403	Fact: No, COVID-19 vaccines have not been linked to infertility after COVID-19 infection. There is no vaccine microchip, and the vaccine will it affect the vaccine?

1077	107073	@SDoughtyMP can you help get some sense on why my GP surgery won't update the WIZ so I can't get my vaccine that all others with Coeliac are getting?
1078	105859	JUST FUCKING TAKE THE COVID-19 VACCINE.I know you will still get the virus, but it prevents you from reuniting with the creator.
1079	107102	@resisterunited @RepThomasMassie What you‚Äôre wanting to do is perpetually be inoculated for a strain that doesn‚Äôt exist because you‚Äôll never be able to make a vaccine quick enough. This is why coronavirus vaccines don‚Äôt make any sense, let alone use tech that doesn‚Äôt have lasting effects.
1080	105765	@TheEconomist Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
1081	106876	@starsandstripes Can I ask why??? If getting the shot doesn‚Äôt help not get Covid-19 and only helps you fight it IF you catch it. So why the fuss if the shot doesn‚Äôt help not catch Covid-19? I could understand if it defeated Covid out right but the vaccine doesn‚Äôt do this.
1082	201655	In early 2020 my Rottweiler jumped on my back and landed just the right way to break one of my vertebrae. In December 2021 I contracted COVID-19 despite being fully vaxxed and fully masked. The possibility of slipping and falling on ice no longer scares me.

1087	105315	Fraud Alert: Scammers are calling requesting payment information for the COVID-19 vaccine, stating if not provided you will be removed from the list for the COVID-19 vaccine shot. THIS IS A SCAM. No one should call you requesting this information.
1088	106143	So what!The vulnerable are vaccinated.  Everyone who wants a vaccine have it.  The death rate has fallen even while PCR positives are up. It's now the flu.
1089	106108	@Liz_Wheeler No, no he isn't. There's a high likelihood (though not yet conclusively proven) that we can protect vaccine-intolerant people from contracting COVID-19 if enough of us receive the vaccine, including our healthy kids. Herd immunity is basic vaccine science.

1158	106659	Dr. Fauci is evil. If you or a loved one ever had a vaccine and really how many of us have not, you will be shocked if this is true. Quick 7 min video and you may refuse ever to take a vaccine again! If true this is really scary! ü§îüòØ

1185	105616	I think there is still much uncertainty regards everything to do with this virus Covid19 that only time will tell? How can you know about immunity when the virus is only 5-6 months old? Even the efficacy of vaccine can't be hundred percent correct until trials confirm success.
1186	107296	No! What we will be remembering is how the UK failed so badly in dealing with COVID-19 and how it tried to claim credit for a vaccine developed in Germany, led by German-Turkish scientists and manufactured in Belgium !!

1215	106225	In terms of preventing infection, I have to say that vaccines are pretty much similar. There's a chance, even if it's 5% or 50%. However a vaccine's main job is to train your immune system to make the right antibodies. If it can do that, then it's effective.

I don‚Äôt like Pfizers vaccine, it sounds like they cut &amp; sliced DNA.
1264	106172	oh btw guys a US pharma company is in the court to prevent china getting COVID19 vaccine because they gon sell it for 50-100$ per person and China after getting the vaccine planning to distribute it for free.
1265	105631	We will continue to get vaccines in the arms of folks like Mr Pillord below @The_BMC and elsewhere, whilst we root for manufacturers and supply chains to get them to our sites ASAP. We are rooting for everyone to get this to work. #CiaoCovid.

1278	106053	How are we going to do that without a vaccine? No vaccine no heard immunity. The Antibodies are lasting weeks or less.
1279	107403	@SHarris518 @POTUS No coronavirus has ever had a vaccine developed. Even if we get 1 it will likely b less than 50% effective, which means a larger number of people likely won't get one, adding. I agree therapeutics is the way to go. The rest I believe is futile.

1282	105739	I really hope it comes to that! The new variant (plus this variant's variant now) is so terrifying, esp. bc the vaccine will be less effective. This applies to the B1351 as well. HQ is not adequate!

1291	106122	@sandwichtable69 @TwTankersley @PaulStanleyLive Influenza vaccine is around 70% effective, so in no way would any virologists expect to see a Covid19 vaccine offer complete protection.

Natural immunity will squash it
1293	106776	I can still get it! If I contract it in the next 14 days the vaccine would've been for nothing but I'd also have some immunity for an unknown amount of time.If I get covid after the 14 days, I'm a lot more likely to be asymptomatic then before the vaccine. üíúü¶Ü

1297	201739	I knew about this but it‚Äôs still pretty amazing how a system can be so ridiculous. My grandparents needed to travel 400 km from their home to get COVID-19 vaccinations, as it was the only place with free spots for vaccine.#COVID19Vaccination #Polska

1325	105573	It‚Äôs the year 2025 and we‚Äôre just going into our 16th national lockdown, which they say will definitely see the beginning of the end of this coronavirus. The promised vaccine is just weeks away, again. #Lockdown2 #Covid19UK

And create tons of masks for doctors and stockpile them for when these things happen because we've got a mass shortage.
1378	105214	"Oh nooo. Is canada just going to wait for #pandemic to spread? Until the ""magic"" vaccine that will take months? #cdnpoli"
1379	106806	@MadFckingWitch @davidsmosspiggy Article pulls a few negative quotes from several researchers to paint a gloomy picture. The reality is 1) The odds of a viable vaccine are good, 2) No coronavirus until this one has been able to infect the lower lungs, so comparing to prev. CVs is unhelpful.
1380	107534	But when it comes to vaccine distribution it is still unclear on equal distribution once health care workers done.  Make these in Usa in bulk and distribute as immunity only last less than 6 months @vivek_murthy
1381	106619	It would be a real shame if all these political leaders and celebrities that are getting recorded taking the vaccine are actually getting an empty syringe to trick the masses....
1382	106598	@coldo71369284 @HagemasterBeth @realDonaldTrump Same goes for the coronavirus; why do you think so many politicians that said the virus is a hoax but yet they are first in line to get the vaccine?  And why are so many non-believers wearing masks (most improperly or never cleaning it)...
1383	106779	@glenzee79 @CNN @StCollinson (The first coronavirus vaccine in history, the vaccine being rolled out, is because of Trump admin, and was completed in 6 months)Orange man bad
1384	105223	@aldatweets @ohdannyboy12 the vaccine does not prevent people from getting coronavirus or spreading it. (it does other things.) every single person being vaccinated (which I am btw) would not 100% wipe out coronavirus. these tweets are tiresome.
1385	106603	Can someone explain why we keep calling it a #COVID19 #vaccine?? Vaccines provide IMMUNITY to a virus. These are shots to BOOST our immune system,  they do NOT make you immune!! I still think we should all get the shots, but I think we should be honest in what it does!
1386	107087	I don‚Äôt know what they put In vaccines , but I thought they put the virus in them Coronavirus is common, it‚Äôs just the strain we look at , correct?Do the ppl that are being tested and have had a positive result also have had  the flu vaccine?
1387	107505	@KurtBusch just heard it suggested on MSNBC that NASCAR drivers (and other athletes) get the Coronavirus vaccine to ramp up the trust of the skeptics in the country. Sounds good to me! Hope you are getting yours soon!!  ‚ù§Ô∏èü¶ã‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üèÅ
1388	107214	How have they been testing the new coronavirus vaccines? Has anyone who has gotten the vaccine been exposed to the live virus or is the effectiveness all hypothetical?
1389	106265	Every day of my life, senior citizens call me desperate to get the vaccine. I‚Äôve even had veterans call me. Seems to me that you would give these 40 shots to an American who actually loves our country not a terrorist. #comeonman

The only people interested in continuing this are the politicians the government and big Pharma. As with SARS 2 no vaccine is needed.
1393	105501	Now you have my attention üòèSeriously though, if I was going to get a shot that would do nothing for me, there are much worse reasons than free beer.  I got 6 rounds of Anthrax vaccine in the Marines and usually had to come up with my own beer and entertainment...
1394	107227	@CornerRadish @therealmissjo @jon_mumford1982 You give no reason, that's unhelpful.There is no cure for coronavirus-19, until a vaccine is developed.An apparently healthy can carry the virus for upto 27 days before symptoms show.During that incubation period an infected person infects others.Isolation is the only defense

1396	105322	@jitterbug212 I'm sorry. I'm at work. Trying to say that even the common cold (which is a coronavirus) has no vaccine. And testing would be an endless cycle.

1399	106107	@catturd2 Have they put these variants into the coronavirus vaccine? To keep it going around the world?
1400	106644	@MeghanMcCain People just don‚Äôt understand how serious the coronavirus is until it hits their family. The question is why are we getting the vaccine? Trump created some of the problems. He didn‚Äôt wear a mask  for a long time. People need to stop criticizing you and do some research.
1401	105419	"@Feldegast1 Flu is not caused by coronavirus famiy but influenza virus family.Other coronavirus can cause ""cold"" symptoms that are mild and therefore no need for vaccine.Each virus-vaccine dynamic is different depending on many factors. Many work great (polio/hepatitis) others not."

1408	106773	@MontgomeryCoMD Here's the #COVID19 vaccine update for MoCo: There isn't any vaccine for you.  And because we're going to vaccinate people who work here, even if they don't live here, you might never get vaccinated.  LOL.
1409	105952	exactly. what y‚Äôall gotta say now? it‚Äôs YOUR CHOICE but i HIGHLY recommend getting the vaccine not only to protect you but someone you love as well. be smart.
1410	107536	Now everyone with the vaccine is a carrier.  Good job, libs, while Pelosi holds huge conference with no masks or distancing.  Hypocrites all the way!!!
1411	105677	The vaccine doesn't work but the most important thing is that there is no virus cause it's never been isolated so no vaccine needed at all
1412	106290	Instead of forcing people to get a random shot, how about we realize how corrupt our govt is that they would release a virus on the world simply because they hate Trump and love power. #coronavirus #CovidVaccine #chinavirus #DoNotComply #democraps #NotMyPresident #Trump2024
1413	106843	I‚Äôve decided not to get my hair did or my nails done. I‚Äôm not dining out until #Colorado is where scientists tells us we need to be with testing (152/100K), tracing etc. A vaccine is at least 1 year away. Please #StayHome #DoYourPartCo #COVID19 @GovofCO
1414	106521	@VinGuptaMD I'd like to know (esp in respect to the immune system), approx number of those who died of covid19 had not had a flu shot in the autumn. Pneumonia vaccines, esp for the elderly? Flu shots come out in September now, and even w/out Covid in them, they help me resist flu
1415	105473	Totally agreed. Testing is the only way out! The WHO has said that even previous infection wont protect you from reinfection, which means even if a vaccine comes, it may only prevent serious infections and not an infection itself.
1416	105816	If the #Government has such faith in these vaccines, why don't they take it first?  #askingforafriend #covid #vaccine #Pfizer #lawthelpus
1417	107210	@AliciaVPP @richardzussman The ONLY oeople in BC who can not get the COVID19 vaccine are;Children under 5 years old.  And that may change very soon, sndPeople who have VALID MEDICAL reasons.Otherwise, there is not a person in this province, or Canada who wants a vaccine who can not access the vaccine
1418	107280	There was always going to be a Christmas lockdown, if you didn't see it coming then bleh. Governments still working on case numbers not deaths. This will continue until you realise what is actually happening. If vaccines don't stop lockdowns what will ? #Covid_19 #COVID19
1419	106180	Anti-Vaxxers think a Flu Shot will give your child Autism... but are lining up right now to give their whole family the COVID-19 vaccine if Trump endorses it.I'm starting to think their thought process isn't based on science... or research... or sense.

1422	105784	Who‚Äôs actually gonna have the coronavirus vaccine if they ever find one? I‚Äôd be very worried about what they‚Äôre actually putting in that shit
1423	107052	What is really in the jab that we all must have it even though we don't need it? Is it sterilisation, a cull, or just a psyop to bring in digital ID cards and social credit?
1424	107510	@MattHancock the whole country is laughing at you. Most don't believe your virus lies, the rest just think you are incompetent. And we have news for you... nobody is going to abide by any restrictions currently or upcoming and we are certainly not being vaxxed #SackMattHancock
1425	106494	@First_class18 @CAgovernor @GavinNewsom @CAPublicHealth @CHHSAgency @Cal_OES @CAStateParks @CalVolunteers @ListosCA COVID-19 mutates rapidly, if there is a vaccine, it only works for short terms. COVID19 isn't going away easily but changes in our behavior can prevent it or manage it if we have it. Other countries can do it...why not the US, too much freedom, opinion, laziness or stupidity?
1426	105657	@Spacedementia87 @davidwhitaker40 @mountainecology @10DowningStreet 1) Do you genuinely believe 100,000 people signed up as volunteers? 2) it usually takes 12-15 years minimum to get a vaccine approved?3) no institute has found a coronavirus vaccine in 20/25 years yet we do in 6 months? Sorry it‚Äôs 98.54% in the U.K. think that‚Äôs high enough
1427	106383	How did healthy, under-65, non-healthcare-workers family got COVID-19 vaccine so soon? They got a tip and used it. Didn't contact any compromised or elderly people or healthcare workers in their family, friend group, neighborhood, kids school.
1428	107071	@NBCLX My great grandma in Newburgh NY got the vaccine, fell broke her hip, and contracted coronavirus/ COVID19 at the physical therapy clinic. YOU TELL ME HOW EFFECTIVE THIS VACCINE IS WHEN THE POEPLE AROUND ME ARE STILL GETTING BADLY SICK üíî
1429	105464	What q shame this this, meanwhile countries around the world have noneThis reminds me like the gun issue, when there is a mass shooting like at a school, outrage abound and after a month everyone forgets and carry on, vaccines are like a news cycle, human behaviour is weird
1430	107117	Has there been any forgery of the COVID-19 vaccine cards? Or is that not an issue yet as they're not yet widely the permission slip back into normal activities?
1431	105665	All those who died of Covid got the flu vaccine this year. Is it because they had compromised immune systems?Or is it something more sinister? All nursing home patients get vaccinated. Why did 5 Dem govs keep Covid patients in nursing homes? ü§î#Plandemic #ArrestBillGates

They‚Äôll have a hand in a vaccine that everyone will willfully take to be rid of coronavirus fears, but it will secretly microchip them, allowing Gates and Co. to track everyone.
1435	107349	Over the last few months, if asked whether I would receive a coronavirus vaccine, my reaction has been yes. But then, I've thought...well, that depends. It depends on what we hear about this vaccine, the approval process, etc. News like this is good to see.
1436	106423	@XylariaVG purposefully inject this man with coronavirus, and tell him he can only get the vaccine if he delivers on these promises
1437	107414	"@thehill ""...the Democrats don't want a vaccine either! They want Americans to die from the Coronavirus!! Not like me, when I ignored it for months, and called it a Democra... oh shit, forget that!"""
1438	201625	All well-informed people know that this is possible - significant protection only *starts* 12 days after the first vaccine dose. The well-known 95% effective rate is only some time after the *second* dose. My reaction to this and news of a few allergic reactions: who cares?
1439	106307	My only regret about getting 2nd COVID-19 vaccine shot is I went there a lil early, so instead of having an excuse to get a nice sandwich for lunch at a place I like near there, I got a dynamite omelet earlier instead.Also I‚Äôm not yet functioning very well as a 5G cell tower.
1440	107132	If the vaccine works then those the want to be protect it OK and my refusal should not matter because those that worried are safe. does this answer your question
1441	105435	So only two outcomes from #COVID19 1Vaccine 2You're antibody test proves your body can fight the virus. Going out is a risk we cant gamble with, the vaccine is risk I will not be so comfortable with accepting. Question everything. #coronavirus
1442	201636	@shiftms Rest,rest and more rest!!! My fatigue has been pretty extreme the last couple of days! And if I didn‚Äôt have to get my 1st Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow, I would stay in bed all day! But I am so fortunate to be able to get this vaccine I will crawl to the Doctors office to get it!
1443	106884	@steveubl When you actually come up with a vaccine for the common cold (which is a coronavirus) maybe I'll possibly slightly remotely consider getting a cv-19 vaccine

1446	105787	@AaronBosterMD @YouTube Thank you for posting. I will be telling my doctors when I get vaccinated, but are there projects ongoing to track MS patients and COVID-19 or vaccines? I'm signed up with Narcoms study, will have my 2nd yearly follow up in 3 months. Any others we should look for?
1447	105886	So, basically, the jab might not actually do much except protect people who don't need protecting and Covid is mainly affecting people with preexisting conditions, like we've known for 18 months now. If this is true then many people are going to jail for a ¬£1 trillion fraud
1448	105265	Not surprising. He's in with Gates' NWO POPULATION CONTROL VACCINE SCAM. Killing people like the elderly in the Nursing homes is  in their wheelhouse
1449	106766	What will parents do if the government mandates the COVID-19 vaccine for children returning to school.  I bet it would create the biggest uproar in history.  Nearly 5000 people have DIED after taking this vaccine.  One kid does and it is game over.
1450	107409	@larssivertsen And he‚Äôs been getting into anti-vaccine David Icke, 5g coronavirus conspiracy nonsense recently, so he‚Äôs seemingly only getting less intelligent

1452	107550	people would probably take a vaccine for the wuhan virus yet not for the flu. People are so so strange
1453	105881	@oOoMzPiinkoOo @VLEXXXGALINDO That‚Äôs a very wrong and dangerous mentality. The coronavirus, yes has been around for awhile but the particular strain HAS NOT. Hence why there is no vaccine or cure for it, therefore we MUST take precautions and STAY home to prevent further spread. Stop underestimating it.

1456	107272	@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Somebody needs to tell Rand Paul to take a flying leap.  He isn't a doctor, he isn't a scientist so he has no business telling people not wear masks if they've had Covid-19 or if you had the vaccine.  Let the doctors and scientist do their job. They don't try and do yours
1457	107661	2 weeks after the election, Moderna announces their vaccine is 95% effective. How long did they know? How long did they delay the announcement to hurt @realDonaldTrump just like Pfizer? I bet Tony Fauci knows. These are his pals. Proof that Big Pharma doesn't care about YOU.

1460	105868	@discipleheart1 It's not what I think it's what I know. This is not a fully approved vaccine, we are going through phase 2 and 3 using the American population. As they push the 'safe' vaccine relentlessly on doctor radio in the same breath they tell us they know very little about covid19
1461	106014	#Unvaccinated #vaccine #vaccinated #VaccinePassports #Covid_19 #coronavirus #VaccineMandate This is why- because the 2 shot vaccine did its job- (people can't think for themselves- they will do what they are told) this is a side effect from the vaccine #VaccineSideEffects
1462	105584	@AdamBode4 @MsMelChen @PeterDrew There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine in 50+ years of research specifically because they mutate so much--using non-sterilizing treatments in mass only drives mutants thru selective pressure and will lead to immune escape.  Vax the elderly/immune compromised.

1465	107432	@RichmondWahoo @diogeron @NewsHour James covid-19 IS SARS-COV-2. It was called that bc it is similar (not the same) to SARS-COV. It's a new virus that belongs to the coronavirus fam. The vaccines work so well bc they were created using existing techniques for covid-19. You take YOUR misinformation out of here.
1466	106333	absolutely blows my mind that there are people in my family who are proud about deciding not to get the covid-19 vaccine

1494	105469	@LifeWithJohn You said you were getting a coronavirus vaccine last time, did you get it? How did you feel after you got hit?
1495	106614	@anandmahindra Good news sir, Oxford vaccine strengthen white blood cell and immune system so protection not only from coronavirus but other viruses bacteria attack.
1496	106783	@JCavallo972 @fcraska30 @HotlineJosh Real question for you. If he already had COVID19 why get the shot? And not just a booster later on like we may need? What am I missing about how vaccines work? Vaccines give you a controlled amount to create an immune response for your body to create antibodies.

1500	106556	@mamasimmerplays @SimplyUniqueYT Wheras influenza viruses mutate so quickly they are sometimes called swarms instead of linear strains. Its truly terrifying to think about when they go epidemic. Im so grateful were dealing with a coronavirus and not influenza virus! Much better chances of vaccine efficacy.
1501	107366	@kallman_tom How many people who've tested positive for Covid-19 with no symptoms. Got a bad test, and are really negative? Then needed more tests? My God the number could be astronomical! Keeping us locked down for nothing. So now, I ask... how in the hell can they make a vaccine? #Lies4U
1502	107104	@Teensthack Indian vaccine is completely safe and above 80% efficacy. We don't need other countries vaccine. E.U trying hard to sell their vaccine. Hence stoping indian vaccine. Everything business. US China's big top companies and vaccine sellers both are behind this covid19 spread.
1503	106206	@commonsnspoli @CNN Covid 19, like any other coronavirus can never go away until herd immunity achieved. Period. That‚Äôs it. Please educate yourself. No deadly virus has ever gone away without herd immunity and/or a vaccine, or drastic mutation to bring less deadly.
1504	105207	Vaccines are helping us all get our lives back, but I've seen all sorts of misinformation since they've become available. Confronting fear with facts is how we overcome vaccine hesitancy. Dr. Walensky has the answers to your questions about the COVID vaccine ‚¨á
1505	105849	Hope scientists come up with the vaccine for COVID-19 asap. Perhaps now scientists would get more grants and funds for R&amp;D.

1507	107673	@PhilLatham @PaulWoldfarm In the last 12 weeks life's changed immeasurably the grim reality is that coronavirus is here with us for the foreseeable future. Even with herd immunity I think it will remain a deadly threat to the vulnerable until an effective vaccine is developed and widely available.

1515	106324	@taradublinrocks Anyone else like me, have a needle-in-arm phobia? Good news! Get a doctor's note to take the COVID-19 vaccine in your upper thigh. I did. It's painless. Seriously. Take a couple of Tyenol gel caps immediately afterward to stave off residual soreness. #IGotTheJab

1524	107152	@poiThePoi @jonst0kes Sure. Long odds, probably. Though I worry that this is the first time we tried a coronavirus vaccine - and we did it in a rush. Why was there no vaccine after SARS or MERS?
1525	201643	DONE with my pneumonia vaccine today. And THANK YOU so much to my hub for the generousity. I only have 3 tablets (Isoniazid) left and can't dropby sa pharmacy.

1530	106224	Pretty much this. Considering recent finds, I'm pretty optimistic on a coronavirus vaccine. That said, I don't think it'll be very effective, we'll probably need multiple doses, and I'm not sure everyone will be able to get one (children or the old may have immune issues).
1531	201709	I don‚Äôt feel well, my upper arm is very sore and hot. I have a neck-ache and headache, taken some paracetamol. #covid19 #vaccine

1533	105918	@DaniBat Oh just the fact that the hemp plants / marijuana were studied long before the COVID-19 vaccines were ever thought of. Then again, I get how you may not know that when you‚Äôre a delusional leftist who doesn‚Äôt live in reality. #1984
1534	107020	@WayneDupreeShow Hell no. If we can get a coronavirus vaccine in a year why isn't there one for SARS or MERS yet?
1535	106021	Not unless there is a variant that both enjoys heat and is impervious to the vaccine.Are we still listenng to Imperial? And what figure did they quote?
1536	105595	Kind of figured that the project would be delayed. They're still using the old Macy's as a central vaccine/testing site in the city. Nothing's going to happen until they get a new, permanent solution to those needs.

1538	107211	@Dan_GT2 They would soon get the shot. I think after all of this everyone who wants to experience things need to have a vaccination card for Covid-19 to do things. No vaccine your going to have a rough time like let's say flying, getting into certain places where crowds are big and close.

Can you explain??? Why is Hopkins article on Covid19 vaccine safety not valid?? Don't assume. Provide evidence!
1541	105323	I'm going to get the Covid19 jab because of the intent if the budget allows it to take a product interstate and possibly overseas to then market.Otherwise I would not consider the Jab because how I feel. I can hide how I feel, but I can't nessicary control how I feel.
1542	107469	So this is why Xeno_ offered to buy @grehpo a beer, while simultaneously trying to put a cone around my head.Trying to trick me into getting the vaccine, eh?
1543	106950	Considering these vaccines will have very unpleasant side effects, I think this is an excellent idea.
1544	107070	@Aflame4Truth So just let the elderly die if COVID-19 than risk a probably safe vaccine. You apparently don‚Äôt have an over 70 loved one.  In the over 5% mortality crowd the benefits far outweigh any known risks. Decisions out of fear rarely work out well. Don‚Äôt give it to under 40 crowd.
1545	107351	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19 and the May 4 pledging conference must be a success. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
1546	106420	As someone in a vulnerable population who‚Äôs trying to self-isolate until there‚Äôs a vaccine, let me just say you couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to get this one.

1551	107230	@davidicke Simple, because people get infected by flu again and again year after year and flu vaccine has to be taken every year then any #coronavirus vaccine will not be a once in a life time vaccine but a yearly vaccine just as the case with flu.

1556	106243	@cafe_health I predicted politicians such as Governors would start trying to prove that the coronavirus vaccine is safe by having saline injected. There's no way in hell they are really getting a vaccine
1557	105254	@DrOtterman Flu is 40-60% and typhoid for another eg is 72%However there is precedent with other vaccines, such as Polio, Smallpox (eliminated) Measles, Mumps, Rubella (97% effective)We know this Coronavirus is different from one which causes flu so that could be why it's more effective
1558	106612	@toxdom I can't think of any coronavirus vaccines, but there may be some. However, an antibody is super specific. If you tested another coronavirus vaccine against CV-19, it would not be able to help show efficacy. It's like having 2 gold keys, each will only fit the lock it belongs to.

1602	105426	There have been many attempts to make viral vaccines in the past that ended in utter failure, which is why we did not have a coronavirus vaccine in 2020.  In the 1960's, scientists attempted to make an RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) vaccine for infants.

1607	106092	@EmeraldRobinson whats it like lying about a Virus (COVID19) that has killed 700k Americans, and Lying about the Vaccine,, JUST SO YOU GET A PAY CHECK&lt; whats it like to be the FACE in the Dictionary next to the word Deplorable
1608	106789	@newscomauHQ @mikepompeo How does a virus get from a #WuhanLab to being inside a human? #vaccines. The people of #china were given mandatory vaccines JUST before this all broke out. Then #5G was rolled out adding further #stress to the body and #coronavirus took over. #cellpoisoningüíâ‚ö°Ô∏è#billgates #WHO
1609	201528	40 mins away from having my covid vaccine .... üí™üèº so scared of needles üò©üò© #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #letsdothis
1610	105821	No really, I give up. I have been fighting to get the world to buy Prevnar and Pneumovax and HPV shots for a decade, and no one in #cdnpoli knew who the F Gavi or @ShotAtLife wasNow suddenly #covid19 comes along and you all know how vaccines get made, ordered and bought
1611	201635	Back from my first Saturday evening out in ages. OK, I took Dad to the health centre for his first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, but it still counts.....
1612	105390	Just because we've got a really good vaccine against polio doesn't mean the same thing will work with coronavirus, because it's so different.
1613	106730	the vaccine against coronavirus is a fraud humanity will have to live with this virus what humanity needs and treatment to not die because with vaccine or without vaccine humanity is dying.
1614	106963	The problem is people come around to wanting the vaccine only AFTER they get sick! Be smart, people! Get it now!!
1615	105289	Morning after #COVID19  vaccine update:- My arm is hecka sore. Much like after the flu shot, I won't be lifting my arm up today.- My brain is foggy and I'm pretty tired. Going up the stairs is tiring and talking extensively is too.
1616	105253	@99freemind @HRHospital There has never been a coronavirus vaccine that ever worked.  Suddenly we are sold two vaccines will save the world.
1617	106043	I actually find nothing wrong with this. Dia cuma utamakan je, like they utamakan front liner. Kita punya turn dpt vaccine memang lambat lagi pun üòÇIn fact, these people helped SO SO SO many lives before. Dont you think they deserve it?
1618	107361	@msnbc has made it abundantly clear. They do not care at all about people who die from taking the vaccine. @msnbc doesn't employ a single person who values human life.  What terrible human beings.
1619	106861	@KobieThatcher @ShazzaCook @deanandy477 @NSWHealth ... and for the Nay sayer, coronavirus Arte known for not having a vaccine because we never found one against the common cold, however, why not now, why not since our research are becoming worldwide, why not now since it is our primarily focus?
1620	107568	This whole thing, all of it, COVID, Vaccines, Republicans, Election, it is all one big cluster f‚Äôck. I‚Äôm going to my corner of the world, done with it all, won‚Äôt watch news, I‚Äôm going to be one of those people who don‚Äôt know shit and are happy as can be. Republicans r a waste....
1621	201526	The jab for #COVID19 is amazing but I‚Äôve had this 24 hour sickness bug for the last 18 hours and don‚Äôt understand why we don‚Äôt have a jab for this! I feel awful!
1622	107344	Random Saturday thought-it‚Äôs amazing to think we got a Covid19 vaccine developed, trialled and partially deployed quicker than the time it took Apple to figure out how to adapt Face ID so that we could unlock our phones whilst masked up ü§îü§îü§î#GetVaccinated
1623	105705	COVID-19 is realMost will develop mild to no symptoms.However, those it does kill, it kills rather quicklyBeing obese is high risk for hospitalization and/or death.The vaccine is probably a good idea for such folks.
1624	106905	@RitaLisaPatton @56Symons @JustinTrudeau @jacindaardern You are either a bot or a very stupid person.  There has never been a vaccine for a.coronavirus ever!  This is a flu bug with a 99.6% recovery rate.  Never a vaccine for SARS or H1N1, and we survived.  You take this vaccine and you will be in a graveyard.
1625	107394	JKL the Kagwe Dilemma. @KoinangeJeff  @citizentvkenya  , In his own words, 'how is the Kenyan vaccine going to work? and how did they know that am going to get covid19? Ama unapewa vaccine na unatumwa penye corona iko?' Just asking.
1626	107369	Feel like a train wreck after receiving my first Pfizer vaccine yesterday. Hopefully, these symptoms will subside quickly and won't be as bad the second time around! Just made me realise how much worse it may be actually contracting Covid19! #happilyvaccinated
1627	106432	Just tell them the vaccine is weak ... Because I took the shot and the vaccine is weak .... You know how hArd it's to work now after COVID-19 ... My body feels like it's 50 I'm 27...I need a booster shot or new shots treatment .. cause it  weak ..it slow your thoughts down dat it
1628	106163	Yeah but will those children be sterile or get cancer  autism, schizophrenia or autoimmune disease? This is a clinical trial on humans and now their offspring. There is no liability for the pharmaceutical companies and the vaccines aren't FDA approved. Still labeled experimental
1629	105653	@IMHOjustsaying @SysOptSpeMike @BrianAckerman80 @POTUS Flu vaccines are required around the world? You may say why choose the flu vaccine, well that is because it is a yearly shot because the virus mutates, the same as the SARSCoV2 virus which is just a coronavirus.
1630	201767	Super excited and relieved to be getting my first COVID-19 vaccine today. One down one more to go in three weeks. üíâ https://t.co/C7cvd0oOTX
1631	105263	@theheraldsun Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
1632	105232	Bottom line is, just get the fucking vaccine already so we can get this shit over with.  The QUICKER we can get back to NORMAL, the BETTER!This is honestly QUITE tiresome... üò†#COVID19 #Delta
1633	107548	Plus I bet that when we do get a vaccine for Covid-19 the Anti-Vaxxers will be fighting the school districts if it‚Äôs required.
1634	105855	@DeAndreHopkins @jalenramsey @MatthewJudon @_fournette @NFL @WFAN660 @7BOOMERESIASON @craigcartonlive Either incredibly STUPID or incredibly SELFISH or just an ahole. Get the vaccine! #PandemicOfTheUnvaccinated #COVIDIOTS #NFL #Covid_19 #CovidVaccine
1635	107560	what did y‚Äôall think would happen with the vaccine? it‚Äôs the same as a flu vaccine, you‚Äôll still catch the virus, it just won‚Äôt affect you as bad as it would without it.
1636	201551	The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine earlier today. https://t.co/Fh102k4hHQ
1637	106211	"@MorningLiveSABC @LeanneManas @SakinaKamwendo Morning Leanne &amp; S.K,YES very hesitant because how does a vaccine get developed so fast so many are losing their lives due to it ,no ""ingredients"" huh ?really?why ?how come?,are we like Guinea pigs??show us what is the covid19?"
1638	107477	#COVID„Éº19 Anyone with half-a-brain - and any slither of regard for fellow citizens, who may be in high-risk groups and especially vulnerable to the virus - should stop moaning about having to wear face masks etc, and GROW UP, ffs!An effective vaccine is the ONLY way forward
1639	105990	@BBCWorld I don't see much point in testing because there is no vaccine. This looks like a #conspiracy to me #coronavirus
1640	106312	@realTuckFrumper I don't believe #IvapidIvanka @IvankaTrump will ACTUALLY get the Coronavirus vaccine.  Don't believe those LIARS about ANYTHING.  I'd bet $$$ it will be sterile saline she gets injected with - DON'T BUY their BS!
1641	105694	#lockdown Eventually, this bug will likely become endemic in the population and be a scourge for years until we develop a vaccine and eliminate it. This, of course, is if the anti-vaxers cooperate like they have NOT with measles. #COVID19
1642	201664	All this waiting.....waiting.......just let me make that vaccine! Here, hold my beer.#CoronavirusPandemic
1643	105642	Excellent news, just a matter if time before Moderna gets approved too. Hope this is enough to convince the ‚Äùvaccines haven‚Äôt been tested enough‚Äù - crowd to get the jabs.

1647	105197	Oh, for Christ sake @CovidData2 #fact : Vaccines against pneumonia do not provide protection against the new coronavirus. #coronavirus #moronavirus
1648	105742	@MickyArison Are you considering that people who already had covid get the vaccine too ? Are you aware the damage it does to the heart if you were already infected with Coronavirus  ?Or are you just droning the chant ?
1649	106300	@UPP_Polls I'm worried that the normal flu vaccine is going to be targeted by antivaxxers when fall comes around, probably with claims that the coronavirus is in it or something.It's only going to get worse when the actual COVID-19 vaccines becomes viable.
1650	106054	Bill gates has a patent on coronavirus. So all the research being done and any vaccine created, he will get royalty payments on. @RoninSamTripoli @luisjgomez @lexfridman @NickHintonn @HighersideChats @tconspiracyguys @daylyt30 @joerogan @TimJDillon
1651	106553	Will the vaccine give you any protection? If you look at the data you would have to say yes. If you then ask will the vaccine keep you from getting the coronavirus? Well you would have to say no.
1652	107527	@mjean2 An effective vaccine will protect someone who receives it by lowering the chance of getting COVID-19 if the person encounters the coronavirus. More important is whether the vaccine prevents serious illness, hospitalization and death.
1653	201518	WELL, I am microchipped jk lol but today I was fortunate enough to get the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 vaccineI believe and trust science. In the spirit of full transparency and honesty I will happily answer questions and post if I develop any side effects etc https://t.co/cVc2tnRZsT
1654	107275	"So are we just assuming the Delta variant ceased to exist and those hospitalizations dont matter? This is easily the most aggressive vaccine ad campaign in history. Imagine if the Govt canceled aids treatment because it distributed condoms for Trojan. ""WRAP IT UP OR DIE"" -potus"
1655	201630	@TomTSEC Just like the @CPofCN hoarding the #COVID19bioweapon vaccine from üá®üá¶ even though we collaborated with üá®üá≥ on it, China protects itself first.Funny the CCP ARMY been enjoying the vaccine for 2 months now while India's soliders are fighting #COVID19 and üá®üá≥ at the same time.
1656	106168	This is actually investing advice now. So um... Even though the #SARSCoV2 vaccines from all these vaccine companies and shitty, you should invest in all these vaccine companies in the long term.COVID-19 causes immune amnesia.
1657	106590	Better to go an vaccinated them. They will never maintain Covid appropriate behavior. My domestic help just took a Covid vaccine after so much of persuading. All her slum walas said you will die if you take vaccine.
1658	106321	I will never get over how people are in public not wearing masks and planning parties and going to bars when coronavirus is still a thing and there is no vaccine and not enough testing.
1659	107434	What's the point of the vaccine then if masks are needed? If symptoms show then the vaccine has failed.
1660	106785	@thereds8 I'm a BIG vax supporter but, there is no vaccine ever going to be available for a 'coronavirus'. Our immune system will only build antibodies against it, for, on average, 6 mths.
1661	106332	@SoCalValleyGal @ChytilTonia @charliekirk11 False equivalency when there is testing, vaccine, and an immunity pool to the flu. Look at another Coronavirus mutation like MERS or SARS.
1662	105689	@bridgebum826 @sarahbeth345 I think there actually is a coronavirus vaccine for pets. My dogs haven't received it. They also didn't catch COVID from us when we had it.
1663	105293	@Neoavatara Human beings just do not develop long term immunity to coronaviruses.  No mammals do.  Even canine coronavirus vaccine must be given every year.
1664	107017	Good for Dr. Tedros! #Africa will not be a testing ground for #COVID19 vaccine. Human beings will be treated like human beings, wherever they are. üëèüëèüëè
1665	106745	@stefaniangelise Yeah no I agree I don‚Äôt get it either, all those vaccines aren‚Äôt permanent either. The coronavirus has been around for a long time. There are different versions of it and this one is just the easiest spreading. I never got them until the army forced me on deployment to get them
1666	106157	@UgimaKenya Maghufuli is right, it will be a long time before a valid vaccine is found. This means that herd immunity is the way to go presently. Western world covid19 template cant work in African economies. Something is wrong and we are stupid not to call out our inept president
1667	201610	@LadyVelvet_HFQ I'm fully #vaccinated! on 17th Sep '21. 2nd Dose with #COVISHIELD #AstraZeneca Successfully completed the schedule of all doses of COVID-19 vaccine.
1668	105870	@patton6966 Hello Mark, I was given the COVID-19 Vaccine. After a few day, I noticed my joint creaking, then my skin became metallic! I am now a robot and am typing this with my mind. How do I tell the world my story Mike? Beep Boop
1669	106777	Why do some ppl expect a NEW vaccine for a NOVEL (uh, new - never been seen before, figuring out how to treat as we go) Coronavirus to be 100% effective on 1st release?  95% efficacy is pretty damn good. This is a HR and ppl are throwing the ball back on the field. *smh* ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§î
1670	201648	I was able to get a COVID-19 vaccine appointment for my dad after waiting TWO hours for the confirmation email, because the site was so overwhelmed. My mom, also a 65+ high-risk stroke/diabetes patient, won her vaccine appointment through a LOTTERY. It shouldn't be this way.
1671	106236	@POTUS don't force all Americans to get vaccine when available.  My body my choice I WILL NOT GET CV IMMUNIZATION.
1672	105766	@davestwittylife They will keep moving the goalposts until November 5. If there is a Covid-19 vaccine in the meantime (very unlikely in my non-medically trained opinion), it will only be 50% effective at best, and will have very troublesome side effects, which they might not tell you about.
1673	107099	And they can‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt take the shot,Vaccines don‚Äôt do what their telling us it does, stop trying to kill us
1674	201770	I had the vaccine for #COVID19 today.  I had the JJ.  I still feel nervous.  Like waking up from a nightmare.  I am glad it is over but still stress for having it.
1675	106203	@nick_ramsey Because the big wave is going to hit in 3 4 5 and 6 weeks and the coronavirus will come back next year cyclically by November 20/20 we need a coronavirus vaccine
1676	201558	No hesitation booking my COVID-19 booster vaccine after the booking went live today, thanks to @Leic_hospital #GetVaccinated
1677	106319	@globalnews Definitely not. However, I do hope all the blind conformists and unthinking sheeple will do so in order to give them a false sense of safety and security, so the rest of us can get our lives back. #Covid_19 #COVID19 #EndTheLockdowns #vaccine
1678	106142	@AndreiManko It‚Äôs been warned about since day one. Hasn‚Äôt anyone stopped to even consider for a second why we haven‚Äôt ever had a coronavirus vaccine? Like, ever? There has always clearly been a market for one.
1679	106978	@CDCgov Does the old COVID-19 vaccine work on new virus? Does it stop the spread or just lesson the symptoms? (Asking for a friend, please don‚Äôt ban me)
1680	105242	@Gekotweets @Ayaanle_bdi Are you implying Coronavirus is god's revenge on the French for banning Hijab?
1681	106909	@realDonaldTrump @GavinNewsom Perhaps in a year to 18 months there may be a vaccine to stop the spread.  One for the coronavirus as well.
1682	106892	Coronavirus vaccines are free of charge. The NHS will never ask for payment or for your bank details. Be alert to vaccine fraud. #coronavirusfrauds
1683	107244	I believe she has done a great job,her plan was to delay an all at once rush to avoid overloading the health care system which sheaccomplished but Sorry folks the reality is there are limits. Ex. what if there is no vaccine? Do we stay inside forever? never have surgeries?
1684	106550	I wasn‚Äôt too sure about getting the vaccine, then Boris Johnson said he is getting it. He‚Äôs so trustworthy and has done a great job since becoming PM, that‚Äôs my mind made up, I will definitely be getting it too. Said nobody ever.
1685	106177	Tested positive for COVID-19 , my symptoms are non existent. I was sick for a day or two. I think the fact that I took the vaccine has an influence in how I currently feel. I'm actually shocked.
1686	106936	bullshit. the vaccine is a preventative measure, not something that is going to kill a child. before saying that kids shouldn‚Äôt get the vaccine, have you asked them about it? it‚Äôs their life, their choice. ones who want to get it, can get it. let them live their lives in peace
1687	106083	You hear that @GOP, @GOPChairwoman McDaniel, and @realDonaldTrump the #CODVID19 will not disappear like magic. Unless we have a vaccine available so this virus is going to be around for awhile.
1688	106215	For those of you who don't know. Covid 19 is being labeled a strain of the Coronavirus. Coronavirus is the common cold. Covid 19 has NEVER been isolated as a new strain. How can you make a vaccine for a virus that has NEVER been Isolated? You can't. Get It yet?
1689	106724	@Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump Vaccine progress is good news.  However it is not useful information for how Covid-19 is being managed nationally as of today, or as of the previous 180 days , or as of the next 180days.  153k in death climbing to 300k more before the year is out.  ‚ÄúGREAT JOB NOT‚Äù Mr Puppet.

1692	105250	Actually, flu vaccine upgraded annually.  Already Coronavirus vaccines on the market for pets and has been for DECADES.  Different strain just like influenza.  Flu vaccine comes out ahead of the season every single year. How are experts now saying January rollout not possible?
1693	105813	And just so everybody is clear, getting the vaccine DOES NOT make you immune to getting Covid. What it does do is vastly decrease your chances of dying if you do contract the virus.
1694	107419	There is no proof that this is even slowing Covid. It may be speeding it up. If the vaccine helps then why were the most covid-19 deaths in children, recorded over the last five weeks? If the vaccine is a vaccine then why are more children infected? Kids did not get sick in 2020.
1695	105237	It‚Äôs easy. All those sitting around complaining they can‚Äôt get vaccinated are just being lazy. Don‚Äôt be lazy, go, get vaccine and save your own life.
1696	105418	@BishopJakes This humans would have to test negative for covid-19 first, if not my house is just perfectly fine, we'll most likely get together when there is a vaccine. #Social_Distancing #StayHome
1697	107410	@NoblePhares Covid-19 isn‚Äôt unknown, and there is actually a vaccine for it, and it‚Äôs free, and it works.. just take the damn vaccine
1698	106577	Wow, just like Trump called it... the Wuhan, China Virus. It‚Äôs called covid19 because they already had a name planned for its purpose- the vaccine!
1699	105797	To say I'm scared is an understatement. I'm still waiting for my vaccination schedule together with my fellow doctors &amp; nurses in Makati. Waiting for DOH to release how much vaccine will be allocated. So waiting game right now esp if private sector frontliners non hospital based

1703	105274	You are absolutely 100% correct because when you get Covid you have more antibodies then when you get the vaccine. You are so right!!!
1704	201701	Glad to have had my Covid19 vaccine today @CUH_NHS. Felt a bit sick for a few mins after the vaccine, but well worth having. https://t.co/Rvypg0yAcl
1705	107050	@KalopaMom @RobertKennedyJr There is one sentence in this article that will prove they are lying... ‚ÄúWhile there are currently no known risks of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine while pregnant, scientists are in the process of gathering additional data to learn more.‚Äù  If you think there are NONE ur an idiot.
1706	105226	I am vegan.  COVID19 vaccines are not vegan or cruelty free.  I don't want to have the vaccine for this reason. #TheOnlyWayIsVegan
1707	106195	This is my story guys. Feel free to share yours. Maybe, just maybe, someone who is reluctant to vaxx will read it and decide they dont wanna go through what you went through and go get jabbed
1708	106377	@dwallacewells I am triple vaxxed, but don't get why we don't lock down unless and until we reach a larger vaxxed percentage. Japan has 90% and pretty much no coronavirus deaths. We still have 1200+/day. If the endemic strategy is to succeed, we need more vaccinated ppl.
1709	107088	@CBCAlerts ‚ÄúDoctors are worried that coronavirus may end up being like influenza, which requires a new vaccine every year both because the circulating strains mutate fast and because immunity from the vaccine wears off quickly.‚Äù
1710	106595	@dspondike @BretWeinstein The question is how well those so-called ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù actually work. Because they do not deliver ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù, the definition of ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù was recently revised to a risk/benefit ratio‚Äîwithout acknowledging COVID-19 ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù-related injury and death.
1711	105472	I'm so going to enjoy rubbing this in the face of these Nigerian liberals. They called us all sorts for questioning the safety of their precious vaccines. Oya see am nau.And this will likely be the very tip of the iceberg.Mandating experimental drugs is stupid.

1717	106427	It's getting worse not better. But hope may be on the way in the form of a vaccine and administration that actually TRIES to stop the virus
1718	105728	@TradeEuropa Panic it's bad but we should preper to situation like in Wuhan it's now. Just to time vaccine in hospitals. China made this panic bcz ppl send so many movies with dead bodys, u can count this deadth cases &amp; thers numbers are bigger then China they give us in information.
1719	105962	@Maselli_Andrea @Forbes Yea, just showing how stupid all of this is! People are wishing death on the other people who don't want to get this COVID-19 vaccine. And we never had people acting like this back in the day when other people didn't want to get any of those other vaccines we have out there.
1720	106017	While I do not wish COVID-19 on any one or their loved ones but (you knew this was coming) if more are to get sick or die it would be ok with me because those without masks and vaccines provide those openings for the virus!
1721	105953	@Forbes So the vaccines don't work?Wouldn't it be a better outcome to get and get over covid-19 if a person is young and healthy?
1722	107481	‚Äúthe covid-19 vaccine is like the PS5: everybody wants it, nobody can get it, and if you‚Äôre rich you already got it like a month ago‚Äù sometimes snl has good jokes

1724	105667	@olives4fun @stltoday No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved, it doesn‚Äôt operate like a vaccine, it‚Äôs experimental and not fully tested. Every attempt at a vaccine against any coronavirus has made subsequent infection worse. There are effective treatments available.

1726	105950	@GBNEWS Do you think it's weird how no world leaders not even the @WHO came out 2 years ago at the start of the pandemic and said take Vitamin D, take Vitamin C and take Zinc, do exercise and get sunshine? They never told us how to prevent getting #COVID19 they just said #vaccineswork
1727	106983	@susan46775136 @kissandmakeupuk @dwilliam9940 It's not a vaccines, it's actually gene editing,permanently changing human DNA. New human species is the result. This has killed all tests animals it was tested on within 12 months after contact with a wild coronavirus. Time bomb ticking in jabbed population.
1728	107418	Let‚Äôs get this clear, just because you get a flu jab does not make you completely immune to flu. So think, a half #coronavirus immune jab will not prevent getting it, so please have a brain, wear a mask&amp;wash your hands. Stay within your bubble &amp;home. @BorisJohnson @MattHancock
1729	107042	if you haven't, please get vaccinated so we can go back to normal and all these people (including) won't be dying of a disease we already have the MF'ing vaccine for Just do it, you're wasting all of our lives now. Are we gonna spread this out another decade?
1730	107238	If this is the case then why will I need to declare my vaccine status (with a piece of paper or app) to get into a pub? What next?  I had my hemarroids done before I can sit down anywhere?
1731	107074	They vaccine will have aborted fetus cells in it, ipso facto, religious exception should be honored.  We are Americans not cattle
1732	107583	@BBCBreaking I don‚Äôt get how they can say the so called vaccine will defeat this virus because coronavirus can‚Äôt be cured and will always mutate, also what about the Brazilian and South African strain, the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work with them.
1733	107081	"Dr. Chaitra Ujjani: ""A lot of our patients have suffered in isolation and fear, and they're not sure they're going to get back to a normal life,"" ""So every oncologist is interested to see how their patients will respond to the vaccine.""@SeattleCCA"
1734	105984	The üá¨üáß fully supports @antonioguterres and the vital @UN work fighting #coronavirus. Today we discussed the need for a coordinated global response to reinforce the most vulnerable countries, accelerating the search for a vaccine &amp; bringing countries together to defeat this virus.
1735	105863	A vaccine for coronavirus is coming.  But will it be ready, or not?  Trump has become obsessed with launching a vaccine, thinking it‚Äôs his best hope for reelection.  New polling shows voters seriously skeptical of the  remedy and the rush.
1736	106131	‚ñ∂Ô∏èFull lockdown until we have a vaccine...OK‚ñ∂Ô∏èLive under authoritarian rule (but not full lockdown)       until we have a vaccine...OK‚ñ∂Ô∏èVaccine may only be 70% effective...OK‚ñ∂Ô∏èVaccine may only be 50% effective...WTF?!Do you not see what is happening?????????????
1737	107279	@AyinAzirinee Depends how it‚Äôs ‚Äòpinched‚Äô. The needle (for COVID-19 vaccines) should go into the muscle, so some pinching is ok but not till the needle only enters the fat layer. Usually pinching is not needed for intramuscular injections. Other vaccines might be different
1738	106193	BUT, BLM/Antifa anarchy ‚Äògatherings‚Äô are acceptable. Wake up America!They don‚Äôt wear masks because they know something they are not sharing with us? Fear is used to control, like demand you wear masks and stay inside.Bull!The only way forward is herd immunity,not deadly vaccines!
1739	107479	@Browney86195309 As per the NHS website, having the vaccine gives you long lasting protection again Covid -19.  There is however still a small chance you can get or spread coronavirus, even if you have the vaccine.  P&amp;O Cruises are determined to protect the health of all guests and crew on board.
1740	201572	@calico_heart_ My heart is failing and I have Stage 4 prostate cancer. No one wants to tell me how long I will be here. Got my two Covid-19 vaccine shots, though!
1741	106435	Shit like this is why I stay home. And will be as much as possible even when they find a vaccine for the virus because unfortunately, there is no vaccine for this kind of stupid shit.
1742	106792	Took my aunt @passionate4ever to get her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at @meijer. Lots of people waiting, but very efficient and easy process getting in and out.
1743	105617	So true. Vaccine in NZ pathetically slow. Not good enough to b smugly sipping flat whites and feeling sorry 4 the rest of the world. Need to re-engage.
1744	105544	It is unknown how long the immunity provided by the #COVIDVaccine may last, however, if one still get infected even after #COVID19Vaccination, #COVIDVaccines protect against severe disease and hospitalisation due to #COVID19.#COVID_19 #COVID__19 #COVID #COVID„Éº19 #coronavirus

1746	107021	I said mutations would come. Sadly vaccine resistant ones will develop soon enough. Then a strain which attacks younger people with greater results. The pandemic will never end. Prepare for the worst. Hope for the best. Anarchy is only ever a few bad months awayüôè
1747	201742	Pfizer, for example, the company recruited 43,661 volunteers and waited for 170 people to come down with symptoms of Covid-19 and then get a positive test. Out of these 170, 162 had received a placebo shot, and just eight had received the real vaccine.

1757	107317	@destinchickMBA @ABC It's called a coronavirus and he downplayed it for months after asking if a flu vaccine would cover it or doctors had considered if uv light shined on the lungs would save us all. Unless he does something concrete nobody cares if he still blathers on like a fruitbat.
1758	106922	@SkyNews @SkyNewsThomas Ooo, I think so. I have been anyway. I‚Äôm vaxxed and had the booster, so I‚Äôve done as I‚Äôve been told and I am not getting on with my life. #COVID19 isn‚Äôt going to miraculously disappear, so it‚Äôs time to start learning to live with it. You know, like we have for every other virus.
1759	201726	The St. Joseph Health Department had a pleasant surprise at the second dose COVID-19 vaccine clinic held at the Open Door Food Kitchen Thursday. A handful of residents came to the kitchen and asked for the shot for the first time. https://t.co/kZxF6PmVcx
1760	106798	Any sentence with ‚Äúuntil we have a vaccine‚Äù is a waste of words.  When ever we do have one it will be 12 to 18 months for efficacy. Why is no one being realistic about this? #covid19australia #COVID19
1761	107494	The #SerumInstitute of India wants ‚Çπ3000 crore from the Modi govt to ramp up the #vaccine production capacity in the #COVID19Era.Who do they think they are.Why would the govt waste such an amount that can easily fund another new Ultra Luxurious Jet Plane for our poor PM?
1762	106815	The vaccines will eventually be here, but in the meantime (3+ months for most), there is a deadly COVID-19 storm raging out there, be very careful. ICUs and medical staff will be overloaded for months to come.
1763	106923	So the entire #Covid_19 #lockdown is because ‚Äúif it saves 1 life‚Äù so i‚Äôm guessing if the #vaccine kills 1 person its a no go right? #BillGates #COVID19
1764	105594	Im done. This is me not leaving my house but once a week for groceries. I can't do this. I spent a year in fear for my life. I was relieved when I got the vaccine. But now this! I don't want to do this anymore.

1767	106080	#GenocideJohnson making us take it on the chin, letting it just move through the population, so our loved ones will die. As planned from the beginning, so continuing now. Mass death and disability without a vaccine.
1768	107444	Absolutely not. That liquid called a vaccine has led to more infections throughout China. People think they are vaccinated and end up spreading the virus. Keep the virus contained there.
1769	106669	I‚Äôm really struggling to cope with this pandemic, what if a vaccine is never developed and coronavirus never goes away? Will we have to socially distance forever? Every time I see the term ‚Äònew normal‚Äô in the media I‚Äôm filled with dread and anxiety. I can‚Äôt keep living like this.
1770	106264	@NaviiThaHBIC @we38we38 @PkmnMasterHolly @MYSTIC7 Yes, but this wouldn‚Äôt be the first Coronavirus I survived. I served in an area that had MERS-CoV....and that coronavirus had a 35% death rate and it still doesn‚Äôt have a vaccine. And for 20+ years we have been sending people in and out, and nobody got test leaving.
1771	106363	@BNODesk The best thing we can do is just live with and take basic precautions unless you want a booster shot every 2-3 months. It seems this coronavirus acts like a cold virus when it comes to escaping the immune system.

1775	105972	This is just so unimaginable and sad. Thinking of everyone who lost someone. Please continue to stay safe and keep others safe by getting the vaccine.
1776	105264	This really hit home.  One of the reasons I got my 1st covid vaccine was for my peace of mind.  Hopefully after my 2nd shot it will help me with my anxiety so I can leave my bubble that I have been living in for a year.  I need to do what is best for me. #COVID19 #anxiety

1778	105756	A Russian scientist has studied the coronavirus for 40+ years. He tells me that the virus has mutated over 22,000 times. So, the virus will win and stay with us. Good luck #NoVaccinePassports #NoVaccineMandates

1785	105628	Why do they? I had no hesitation about taking the vaccine, everyone I know who‚Äôs had it had no hesitations and people yet to have it have no hesitations. Even if they do have hesitations they appreciate they have to. If anything it‚Äôs the older generations that are antivaxxers.
1786	105695	Just keep it moving. Open it up so that everyone who wants to get the vaccine can. No point bemoaning the vaccine hesitant. With coaxing and different incentives, in time some will get it. As for those who are totally against it (a minority hopefully), nothing you can do.

1797	106552	@mel_faith1 @Cocoa_Bean10 You make a good point, however COVID19 stands for coronavirus which is the easiest to make a vaccine for.

1806	107608	... people who had COVID-19 already may feel that they do not need to take the vaccine. I would be interested in pointers to whether people have checked for this, e.g. polls about vaccine hesitancy‚Äù including the option ‚ÄúI will not get the vaccine because I was already infected‚Äù

1832	107273	Wake up idiots. Corporations do not have the authority or right to discriminate against you for not taking an vaccine. It's a violation of the Nuremburg Code and a human rights violation. They're lying to you as they demoralize you with lockdowns for compliance. #COVID19
1833	106639	The way trump has embarrassed us on the world stage. Think about this. Assuming any other country creates the covid-19 vaccine before America does. Where will America fall on the distribution list. My guess is last. So hunker down folks.
1834	105961	I am not taking another COVID-19 booster shot. My right leg locked and could not move it for 20 minutes until just now.
1835	105851	@RealMickFoley Yep!They've been working on the SARS-CoV-1 vaccine for over 20 years &amp; then when the coronavirus hit, SARS-CoV-2, they just switched to produce the vaccines we currently have to fight COVID 19. So anyone's logic that they don't trust them because they were rushed, THEY WERE NOT!
1836	106275	@ProjectAzorian7 @BigOrangeJB @newschannelnine *Coronavirus but good job showing your hand. But yeah ultimately an Officer uses discretion on certain laws like you brought up with speed limits, but sure. Go ahead and equalize car fatalities that have many reasons for happening compared to dying to a virus with no vaccine.
1837	107478	@PoliticsCarlos @chrislhayes How about the world puts pressure on who created covid-19ü§∑ because he has the antidote for covid-19 at 99.9% but yet noone has shown a vaccine that's 100%and does anyone know who this man is??

1839	105723	Add Italy to that list now too. The new coronavirus variant is around 70% more infectious, ministers say, but NO evidence so far to suggest it causes more severe illness or wouldn‚Äôt respond to vaccine.
1840	105243	@MeidasTouch We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
1841	105437	it's  getting  bad here.     We  are  walking  amongst  carriers.  it's  getting worse.  halt the  Xmas   rules.   lock up.  I'm  doubting this  vaccine  now.

1846	105417	@nprpolitics This is fitting...because Covid-19 is a hoax, wants to take credit for a vaccine, that he won't take...

1848	107552	@RealKPenceNotSL How is a healthy unvaccinated person a public threat?  THERE IS NO VACCINE WHICH PREVENTS COVID19. Vaccinated does not equal immune, just like Unvaccinated does not equal infected. I can't even imagine why you would make a statement encouraging interning unvaccinated Americans
1849	107557	@NCIDirector @FLOTUS @theNCI Realistically if we can get a vaccine in 1 year for coronavirus, because of unlimited funding from nearly every nation, course a cure for cancer is out there! Not enough is being done and too much red tape and greedy corrupt pharmaceuticals  #WorldCancerDay
1850	107250	The ‚ÄúLeadership‚Äù calls Troops concerns about the vaccine as ‚Äúexcuses,‚Äù but if they get the vaccine &amp; have reactions...they will call their symptoms ‚Äúexcuses.‚Äù  And then they ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù you to get it...despite VA denying Vets when you try &amp; claim compensation for adverse actionsüòí
1851	105218	@cwaide3 @sarahwoodwriter Try working in the healthcare industry and for months bullied because you held out on test vaccine. Then Pfizer gets full FDA approved and coworkers testing positive for coronavirus. Bullies spreading to unvaccinated.
1852	201715	My sister received her first Moderna #COVID19 vaccination in her second trimester. She got the second shot a month later. Her baby was born August 9th with protective neutralizing antibodies. I am so grateful to my sister's OB/GYN for ordering her the vaccine.

1854	106856	My mother is a Manatee County resident, who is over 65, and doesn't trust the vaccine rollout. Comments like this from our governor, and vaccination exclusivity such has been exhibited in Lakewood Ranch, are why. This is shameful!

We have the answer with Inovio‚Äôs vaccine but corrupt Fauci and coronavirus task force refuse to acknowledge their success with funding and YOU ALLOW IT!! Pathetic
1859	106147	Does anyone believe this? I  am not buying it. They really want to force everyone to get the vaccine. What say you?
1860	105241	They will just make it an option for the flyers, pay extra if you want to sit in a vaccinated area and served by a jabbed stewardess. Lol the spirit way.

1865	105520	The race to find a COVID-19 vaccine is well and truly underway. But will the highest bidder get it first? Where does Australia stand in global rankings? Tonight on @7NewsAustralia

1871	105455	@TomiLahren The choice of whether to get the vaccine or not isn't only about whether we think that we ourselves would get Covid-19 or survive it if we do.  It's about achieving herd immunity to put the pandemic behind us once and for all so that life can get back to normal again.
1872	106247	Hurray! Another vaccine being rolled out. Can‚Äôt happen fast enough. In awe of the vaccine/ID team in Oxford who have developed this so efficiently.
1873	201708	A vaccine fit for a Queen... If it‚Äôs good enough for Her Majesty (and my grandparents), then it‚Äôll be good enough for me when I‚Äôm called up. Whether it‚Äôs Oxford-AZ, Pfizer-BNT, or Moderna, I‚Äôll be thrilled to get it in my arm. üí™üèº
1874	201687	@LilacAmy11 @thehill Let's be real honest here, it does not keep you from getting covid19! You can get the jab,wear a mask, oh and still get covid19 IS ANYONE listening.  My friend got the jab, wore his mask and still got covid19 (TWICE). leave Matthew alone!
1875	106965	My take, FWIW: the prediction that 60-80% of us will get coronavirus is still true.  And current level of lockdown can;t last until there's a vaccine.  So at some point we are all going have to go out and face the virus again, only this time more will catch it.  Question is when.

1880	106286	@DeanoMalcs Therefore there cannot be a COVID VACCINE or Covid-19 derivative. The vaccine is not a vaccine. But its designed to make us sterile or murder us. This is why the vaccine is Fake.
1881	105779	Herd immunity has never happened without a vaccine in fact it is a term that the vaccine companies came up with in particular to sell the polio vaccine because vaccines are relatively new and people are kind of freaked out herd immunity sounds really cool but it takes a vaccine

1887	106125	I‚Äôve been very anxious seeing all the unmasked people in Telluride Film Festival.  Jamie Dornan has asthma so I think he is very vulnerable vaxxed or not.  I hope everyone is well.  COVID-19 is very unpredictable.  I‚Äôm fully vaccinated myself but still takes precautions.
1888	201651	Knocked several dozen things off my to-do list today. Including signing up with OHA so I'm notified when I'm eligible to get my Covid-19 vaccine. (also planning a drive-by baby shower in my copious spare time for upcoming grandbaby.)
1889	106266	Guys I'm starting to get really worried that when my turn comes around, if I don't post it on social media, the vaccine won't work. #COVID19
1890	105364	"@musepwt @katrosenfield Please do not dilute a word like ""genocide"" for treating this post vaccine coronavirus like we do other coronaviruses.  We have never halted society simply because some do not have full immune systems.  That's monomaniacal."
1891	106194	Pple just take care of yourselves no vaccine is going to help here instead you will get sick from these vaccines and develop complications you never had before. At this rate our scientists are not sure of what they are doing It is all about money n being bought to push narratives
1892	201584	My whole family had COVID it was not easy and still have after effects   3rd vaccine and flu shot down.
1893	105441	@chrislepkowski Similar experience but after only having 1st jab. First time I'd been inside a social venue since it opened, wearing my mask unless sat at my table. Got COVID19 and only just had all clear today. It's horrible, goodness knows what it would have been like without a jab.
1894	106979	"""Ya but I'm vaccinated"" is the response I got when I told someone they seem to be going places like covid is no longer a threat. Forget immunization, the COVID-19 vaccine seems to have given everyone a confidence boost."
1895	107412	Since Putin has inoculated his daughter first, we need to bank upon the effectiveness of the vaccine. Putin has tightly slapped Xi Jinping in the face after he wilfully spread the virus, across the world. China has given birth to this pandemic. Xi should be charged with genocide.
1896	105225	The world is waitingBut don't buy the stock market hype around coronavirus vaccine and treatment companies (CNN Business)
1897	106217	@HillaryClinton New studies are coming out showing that if you had Covid-19 your still immune. So those who have had COVID-19 should consider if they need it or not. There are no long term studies on the vaccine to know how long it last since it‚Äôs NOT a virus. Be smart, research and decide 4 You
1898	105621	@HD2onPBdotcom @yggdrasilash24 @tnewtondunn Doctors are being told to write Covid-19 for all patients. Even those dying of advanced cancer.

1899	106774	@mbzy89 @samhealey1 @madhatterpress @AnnastaciaMP All viruses mutate and the native nature of a common coronavirus, (its not novel anymore after over 2yrs), is that the mutation devolves. No-one ever catches the same coronavirus twice due to how the bodies immunity system works.Faux vaccines will also create weird strains.
1900	105938	I am sad to say this #coronavirus is not going away anytime soon, Even after a #vaccine, you cant #vaccinate for the basic coronavirus, so making a vaccination for #COVID19= I believe is next to impossible Simply because basic Coronavirus is naturally your common cold #virus!
1901	107251	@ChrisAlderson17 A) Your immune system relies on antibodies to work, and if you haven't contracted this virus, you don't have any.B) Acute COVID-19 illness is multi-systemic, long-lasting and still poorly understood.C) Billions died of disease until vaccines were discovered.

2064	106966	@PWZambino @GOPLeader If there wasn't new variants of the flu there would be no need for an annual flu shot. We can't get ahead of the coronavirus any more than the flu. A true vaccine would only protect us from one variant not others that become immune to the vaccine.
2065	107502	If the vaccines work then why does and approved vaccinated American need to stay in Canada for 15 days?
2066	106609	@Law09804159 @Wanda2116 @NBCNews (5) It‚Äôs theoretically possible but sadly because there isn‚Äôt much demand, there is little funding for it. If HIV became a same destructive scale of Covid-19 global pandemic, a vaccine would‚Äôve been developed.  For cancer, you can‚Äôt make a vaccine because
2067	106636	Waiting for @thegreatleader8 to make a statement about the #coronavirus. What can we do to protect the children? Do the vaccines work, or just an excuse for gov to control our minds? Is this revenge from the Chinese? Is it too late for us?
2068	107576	As someone in a Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial that won't conclude for 2 more YEARS, Trump's continued claims that a vaccine will be released in the next few weeks or months is how do you say... La foutaise...
2069	107393	If I didn't have to get groceries I'd never leave my house till we had a vaccine for #covid19.  I can't even describe the fear I feel when I do.

2077	105245	@WebMD This is nonsense. There are vaccines and treatments for the flu. Hopefully, there will be one for COVID-19 by December. These scare tactics help no one, especially since the overwhelming majority of the country is still living in isolation and struggling with depression.
2078	107466	@FaceTheNation @ScottGottliebMD @WhiteHouse I‚Äôm thinking speed is not the most important element when it comes to developing a vaccine for the coronavirus. I‚Äôm thinking maybe safety? Efficacy? Just throwing it out there.
2079	106878	@Sue76329293 @CascianoJeri @mariapaolarj @joerogan SARS-COV-2 Covid is a coronavirus, so are some cold viruses. Humans do not build robust lasting immunity to coronaviruses. You can and will catch them again and again. No vaccine protects anyone from any disease 100%.
2080	105772	Some people think the mere raising of a question is a refutation, or a dismissal, or an attack on an idea. Detailed answers sometimes require deep expertise. This thread explores why we might have a #COVID19 vaccine long before one for HIV, SARS &amp; MERS. Good thread!
2081	105427	Exactly why it needs to stop being called a vaccine!! It‚Äôs a shot just like the flu shot. It doesn‚Äôt stop you from catching it or passing it on but it does help your body fight it if one does contract COVID. Really think more folks would get it if it was properly marketed.
2082	106624	Pence is saying we‚Äôre gonna have a vaccine soon. Why did we wait till early 2020 to start working on one when the virus was rampant in China in 2019? Why dismantle the pandemic task force? Why call it a hoax at first? #Mismanagement of #coronavirus #VPDebate #VPDebate2020
2083	105832	@tunkuv @asymmetricinfo ‚Äúuniversal vaccines will also target proteins found in the core of the virus which are far less likely to mutate‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt necessarily claim it will be a pan-coronavirus vaccine, but it has got the potential to be so simply because of where it is targeted.‚Äù aren‚Äôt definitive
2084	106447	@IvankaTrump @DailySignal I'm more interested in your discovery of a vaccine for Coronavirus. How's that coming?  Sorry, you're probably too busy getting trademarks for the masks you're having made in China. My bad.
2085	105884	Being awake while they pulled out the food and breathing tubes is a feeling I‚Äôll never forget. This wasn‚Äôt COVID-19 related so I can‚Äôt imagine the long-term toll a respiratory disease like this will take on someone‚Äôs body‚Ä¶ fuck this absolute shit man. Please get vaxxed
2086	107146	@edcokpareke @Advocat78311031 @jiranma @hitRECordJoe Sars yes, influenza no... wow... this is what we're dealing with... and no we haven't successfully made a vaccine for a coronavirus before. Not even hard to research. Seconds is all it would have taken you. Unbelievable.
2087	105483	If you haven‚Äôt figured this out yet‚Ä¶masks first, vaccinations next. This is nothing more than a preparation for vaccinating children. Letting kids go maskless would only prove they don‚Äôt need this vaccine, so keep them masked until they can vaccinate them.
2088	105524	Then we will see how loyal Donald Trump's followers are to him. I mean they're willing to catch covid-19 and die from that why not be the first one to get the vaccine. It's only right.
2089	107219	Viruses as we have been taught to understand them don‚Äôt exist and the colds and flus we can get is a natural process our bodies go through usually once or twice a year. So why do they really want us all to have flu jabs while forcing us to wear masks in the summer? I know why
2090	106347	An absolute disgrace. Fed and NSW governments deserve very heavy scrutiny for how they let this happen - how getting a vulnerable community like this vaxxed wasn‚Äôt a priority, MONTHS ago, is beyond me. Woeful stuff.
2091	105503	People will legit do coke with no hesitation but when it comes to a life saving tested vaccine it's an issue??? OK

2094	106674	still my fellow Americans!4. I don't get the flu vaccine because...(in regards to coronavirus) I don't want to increase my chances of getting an upper respiratory illness including 4 strains of coronavirus by 36%.

2115	106891	@marty_walsh @BCYFcenters These tests yield 50% false positives - test positive for any coronavirus (i.e. if you had a cold or took the flu vaccine), and if you test positive they count anyone you were in contact with as positive as well.  They want the numbers up to keep us iving under tyranny.
2116	106637	The COVID-19 virus is a plague that can be avoided if you would only get the virus vaccine shot. But then if you want to die keep doing what you are doing ,but then all the innocent people you are taking with you. You should be put down before you kill them too.

2173	106350	This is not a flu ü§ß. Covid-19 is the grim reaper comin‚Äô for ya üíÄ.  The vaccine üíâ is free and available. If you can still make the choice you have time to get the vaccine. Life or death (‚òÄÔ∏è or üíÄ)?  ü§î #GetVaccinated #VaccinesSaveLives

2175	105321	@KFLAPH and so should we. Especially with @FordNation getting rid of mandates everywhere. I will not feel safe to get any medical care now that mandates for HCW are gone. DO THE BOOSTERS for everyone. Now. Do not wait until things get bad. Do it. Toronto is.
2176	107310	These measures are designed to balance reopening while controlling the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives. We‚Äôve come a long way, but it is still critical that we mask up, socially distance, wash our hands, and get the vaccine when it‚Äôs our turn in order to end this pandemic.
2177	107245	Dear #UPSC2020 aspirants and people demanding #PostponeUPSC_CSE I want to reach out to you guys. Just demanding a postponement arbitrarily till Dec has no logic!  genuine demand should be a coherent and clear one. No vaccine &gt; no exam. The virus has post treatment complications.

2210	106011	If you get the Covid-19 vaccine &amp; get mild flue-like symptoms, then test positive for Covid-19, it only means the vaccine is doing what it is supposed to do. All 3 vaccines, contain or produce covid-19 spike protein.  The rapid antigen test actually tests for this protein.
2211	107174	@billpeduto @ConorLambPA What can be done to make sure that the vaccine gets to the groups in the order that's been dictated?  If this is going to keep happening then throw it open to everyone.  The clinic should be held responsible here too.
2212	106711	Just a friendly reminder that the covid-19 vaccine does not make you IMMUNE from the virus. Why do you think people in Japan wear masks. They do it not to protect themselves, but to protect others. Let‚Äôs flip the script and maybe care a little more for each other?

2291	107472	@AllSaintsDai @televisionaryZW @pupadhyaya_ Right, although they can create illness. Happens pretty often. It‚Äôs not that people SHOULD get sick, it‚Äôs that people WILL get sick. We‚Äôve never created a coronavirus vaccine and the biggest reason is they take so long that it‚Äôs usually not needed by the time it can be deployed
2292	107199	But...checked my local area info and they‚Äôve started on group 5 so hopefully not too long now #covid19 #vaccine #group6 #type1diabetes
2293	106501	@GMB imply one in five will refuse the vaccine, and yet @YouGov nationally discovered only one in ten would refuse it. So who are #GMB asking to get their personal stats? #COVID19 #COVID
2294	106088	@spikedonline @FraserMyers #France #Republic#RevolutionNow #stjust No, the #French are an #awaken #libertarian #nation They have a history of confronting #tyranny#Covid19 and #Shadow #KingMakers are their new targetCongratulations France #Vaccine or Not, do keep going!
2295	106807	@SarahforHD134 @RealCedricDark I don't spend a great deal of time on anti-vax message boards‚Äîbecause I don't hate myself‚Äîbut does anyone happen to know what their stance is on the potential COVID-19 vaccine?Are they planning to take it/let their kids take it?
2296	105699	One reason I am not that afraid of antivaxxers on the coronavirus is because I think there are going to be lots of vaccine mandates at schools, airlines, employers, etc. Anti-vaxxers are going to end up having the get the shots.
2297	105239	Could someone explain to me why  I'm not excited  about the covid-19 Vaccine  why am I laughing  that this shit ain't  going to work
2298	107234	and still that might not be enough bc there is a large swath of Americans saying they won't get the vaccine and might render herd immunity impossible
2299	107426	"So it's going to be safe for ""student athletes"" (football only mind you) to return to campus, but the scholarship student that may be able to help discover a vaccine for Covid-19 in a campus lab isn't?@NCAA @CBSNews @espn @Espngreeny @stephenasmith @GetUpESPN @joeovies @AGoldFan"
2300	201514	@CPH2021 I have a paper COVID-19 vaccination card indicating my name, date of birth, the type of vaccine I got (Pfizer), location of vaccine and dates of doses.
2301	105901	Idiots who refuse the coronavirus vaccine for no good reason should be restricted to their houses like in Austria. We need to let people with cancer get proper treatment instead of being side-lined due to disease ridden vaccine refusers.
2302	105651	@cheri_rotruck Besides that they say the vaccine has some kind of DNA properties that will affect your DNA so why would you want to take the vaccine the word I heard is when you go get tested for covid-19 there is a chemical in that Q-tip what causes cancer in your body
2303	105329	This is madness. No vaccine can be  developed in 6 months and declared safe in days.If you are stupid enough to let them inject you with this you deserve everything you get
2304	201795	@GovMikeDeWine Hey #AntiVaxx people and #AntiCovid people. I am two weeks into my #Moderna #COVID19 #Vaccine and I still only have 10 fingers, 10 toes, 2 arms, 2 legs, 1 head, not a zombie, no change in my dna or any, not sterile, and still functioning just fine. Get a clue #VaccinesAreSafe
2305	106890	"It's 100% factual they're using placebos and I've also seen ""Fact Checkers"" saying that it isn't an experimental vaccine trial. It is.If the pandemic was so dangerous and vax so safe, why are they giving Placebos?Maybe they know the adverse reactions would be huge.Think..."
2306	107581	@OrdinaryMadn3ss @Nmenon777 That's fine to Wuhan coronavirus has an approximate 99.6% survival rate. They never plan on everyone not getting the virus. They planned on not flooding hospitals with coronavirus cases and creating a vaccine for those that it may be necessary for.
2307	107283	This was a huge mistake made by Russia. More than half the population won't get the vaccine because their vaccine was out so soon and did not have large testing trials to see if there were any problems with it.
2308	107029	ANYTHING RELATED TO THIS LAB-DISEASE IS FUNNY...ALL THE BRANDS MARKETED SO FAR ARE NOT UNIVERSAL IN OTHER WORDS PFIZER VACCINE CAN NOT BOAST THE IMMUNE SYSTEM OF AFRICANS OR EITHER WAY SINOPHARM VACCINE IS HARMFUL TO EUROPEANS...WHAT A HELL FOR THOSE WHO STILL BELIEVED THERE ANY
2309	107613	"What ARE they hiding.  If one goes on the Janssen website, as I did yesterday, and click on "" For Health Professionals"" all is well spelled out.  Trial info.  The ugly is especially there.  They are transparent.  No one is talking about injecting  PEG in the MrNA vaccines."
2310	106069	Trump's briefing, if he has such a good feeling about vaccine, maybe he s/b a willing volunteer to try the vaccine first! @PeterAlexander you are a great journalist! You are a honorable man, @realDonaldTrump is not! He's choosing this time to attack journalists who call him out!
2311	105680	Okay, I get it We can't do anything about the migrant crisis but where is the Vaccine for this Virus!?#COVID19 #Corona
2312	106499	You keep going on @newsmax telling people these vaccines are safe.  How the hell do you know that? If they are so safe why has Big Pharma been giving immunity against lawsuits for people who have suffered adverse effects?  Do you personally know of the LONG TERM EFFECTS?...1/4
2313	105989	@multibleron @flyviz @indepdubnrth That is true but you miss the point, rushed vacines are not safe if coronavirus vacines were straight forward then we would have one for other Coronavirus 30%of colds are caused by Coronavirus there's no vaccine for SARS CoV1 mers CoV
2314	107600	@IngrahamAngle Well, I worry coronavirus may pick up speed. I am going to vote for person with best administrative skills and experience, Bloomberg, that could mobilize supplies, vaccines, health personnel as stores close, hospitals fill, and fear spreads due to possible coronavirus pandemic
2315	105846	2 national treasures for the price of 1! If you get offered a vaccine, please for the love of all that is good take it! #COVID19 #vaccine #COVIDVaccine
2316	201644	On September 27, 2021, I received the 2nd #Pfizer Vaccination, the side effect that was experienced was only pain in the arm after the injection.  How to Relieve Pain from Vaccine Injections that I did was to compress warm water, not long after it returned to normal.#COVID19
2317	107637	"@BrentHodgson Eventually, everyone will need to develop immunity against COVID-19 and there are only two ways to do so - get the jab or get infected. Spread  of coronavirus is ""necessary"" in order for everyone to develop immunity."
2318	106940	This is a SARS based virus. So, you know its not found yet a vaccine for SARS, they found only a treatment. I don't want to say bad news to good people, but I'm not hopefull for Covid19 vaccine. #vaccine, #coronavirus
2319	106311	@Justaguefan @ToothpasteWords Yeah if HCQ worked for a stronger coronavirus in Sars, you would think it would for Covid-19. But the pharmaceuticals won't make a profit from it like they would from vaccines.
2320	107372	@VaclavRomanov @PokerPolitics Dogs piss on trees? Maybe that's the answer to the Coronavirus vaccine.   I think I got it now.
2321	106226	Fuck. All. These. Idiots. Honestly, any dumbass protester who gets in the way of me getting a life saving vaccine is going to be on the wrong end of a HUGE amount of pent up pandemic rage. #FAAFO
2322	105252	@htTweets#cancelcompartment1. Students got compartment only in one subject.2. Students failed by very few marks.3. Coronavirus cases still increasing with precautions,no vaccine yet.4. We are stressed and depressed. 5. Students who did not appear for exams get promoted.
2323	106293	"@sailorrooscout You should go on @LindseyMastis's ""Coronavirus Alert Desk"" Program, Explain why MU is not vaccine resistant and talk about the Fold-Reduction studies! You would be the voice of reason..."
2324	107503	@d3_valenzuela @llovesparks @KenDilanianNBC What I‚Äôm saying is the rooster is coming home to roost on the vaccine. The scientists told us over a year ago that in animal trials they observed antibody dependent enhancement which means when you come in contact with a wild coronavirus your immune system overreacts. 1/2
2325	107553	@PhillyD Maybe they don‚Äôt work has anyone considered that it‚Äôs experimental and we have never had a vaccine for a coronavirus just saying ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2326	106613	"All for ""COULD"" huh ?In that case I'm not taking a vaccine because it ""COULD"" harm me.I'm not downloading the covid app @ScottMorrisonMP because they ""COULD"" use the information to abuse my rights.I ""COULD"" go on forever."
2327	107150	@BBCRealityCheck @AdamRutherford @FryRsquared I don‚Äôt know if this is valid question but whilst a vaccine for coronavirus is being developed, would there be any benefit to giving all or some vulnerable people a pneumonia jab? Potentially try to reduce effect if it was contracted?
2328	201614	Heading out to get my second shot! I‚Äôm excited and deeply grateful to the scientists who created the vaccine, the medical staff administering it, and all the people patiently waiting to be immunized. #VaccinateNY #Vaccinate #COVID19 #Covid19Vaccine #NY
2329	105690	Coronavirus vaccine coming out Tuesday. My home lab is a mess right now but it‚Äôs coming along nicely, just need a couple more hours in the oven for a nice even bake. I‚Äôm sure that the president will be happy to hear that the vaccine will got to the highest bidder on eBay.
2330	106248	This pandemic will not be over until it‚Äôs over for everyone, everywhere. I‚Äôm calling on @Novavax to pledge their commitment to making sure the COVID-19 vaccine is distributed fairly and equitably around the world. #OneWorldProtected
2331	106037	@joey_sasso @kanyewest Good point.. Kanye is against vaccines.Sheeple need to take a step back and realize the never-been-done-in-mass-before Moderna mRNA COVID19 vaccine electronically injects genetic material into your cells. Think Monsanto. We're the guinea pigs.Don't believe me? Research.
2332	106126	@KXAN_News @averytravistv Yes, Avery Travis I used the system due to me getting the two stage coronavirus vaccine in March &amp; April and not having a great experience  with the coronavirus vaccines. Great job Avery Travis on your news story and thanks for posting this news update on the coronavirus vaccine.
2333	106068	I keep a photo of my negative PCR results on my phone.  And I'll add my Moderna shot card when I can get the second jab.  Not everyone has easy access to 'their doctor'.  Do private practice clinicians have access to their state's vax database, like medical groups do?
2334	105958	Mishap? Thats the whole reason people are there...to get a vaccine. Thats not a mishap, that's manipulation
2335	106418	The #Oxford coronavirus #vaccine successfully provokes a strong immune response, an analysis has found.
2336	106844	You all need to be asking why? Why push this vaccine that only lessens symptoms and has no long term safety data. Why? What's in it?
2337	107293	@Charles_Castle_ @newzjunkey @RexChapman What gets me is how they make it out to be such a BFD, when it's not.Bad reactions to the vaccine are miniscule; bad reactions to COVID-19 are over 730,000.
2338	106741	I don't understanding why they don't say the naturally infected individuals don't need to take the vaccine and save these doses to others that need it?6 months immunity if you were infected or you took the vaccine (same).
2339	106635	Mark my words. There is a sh*t storm in humanities way when people will get vaccinated with this trial vaccine. Especially the kids will suffer in long term cases. #COVID19 #Omicron
2340	106062	just saw an infographic about how to confront someone who doesn‚Äôt want to get the covid-19 vaccine. y‚Äôall are INSUFFERABLE
2341	106942	Just like the flu mutates and strains change every year (why they make a new vaccine every year) so is/does/will the Coronavirus. Move on. Open the Country. Lets get on with life!
2342	201626	Love it, @DanielAndrewsMP ‚Ä¶but would‚Äôve loved it even more if I hadn‚Äôt had my booster last month! ü§£ A big step up from the mere lollipop @mjrowland68 and I had hoped for‚Ä¶üòÇ
2343	105514	Life would be so much better without: Vaccine passports. Required testing with nasal swabs and throat swabs. Required masking.Do you really want to live your entire life this way? SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus. It‚Äôs not going anywhere‚Äîdespite what arrogant scientists say.
2344	106010	When the time comes‚Äîunless you CANT get the vaccine for medical reasons‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want you to talk to me again if you REFUSE IT.#DisabilityVisibility #DisabilityRights #DisabledNotDisposable
2345	106770	@ffweekend how is it you're OK with mandatory vaccines (MMR etc.) for kids going to school yet you are outraged when it comes to businesses and schools mandating the covid-19 vaccine???#hypocrite
2346	106737	I've asked this question before so...If the COVID-19 vaccine, ada elemen tak halal dalamnya, would you as a Muslim take it or not?
2347	105759	Must watch video if you‚Äôre weighing up having the vaccine. Ive already made my decision. It‚Äôs not about anti-vaccine or pro-vaccine, it‚Äôs about what‚Äôs right for humanity.
2348	106642	@discu55 @StinaJoy @ThePatrickFranz @NerdyMom1202 @business You don't understand bumkiss, you say it would be boring if we were all the same, yet you want people that have had Covid19 &amp; no symptoms to take a vaccine that doesn't protect against it or keep you from spreading it, but only lessens the symptoms.You've been fear mongered.
2349	106629	@burnett_cain @riseupmelbourne They haven‚Äôt got a vaccine for the most common coronavirus in history(the common cold) yet they‚Äôve got one for this. Are people actually swallowing this shit. In the U.K. we‚Äôve been told the ‚Äòsecond wave‚Äô may hit this winter. Who didn‚Äôt see that coming.
2350	105811	@DerekDenhamAlan @DPrabhata @maggiemfox @jechristensen @TAWaldrop You think pneumonia can‚Äôt scar the lungs and also cause long term problems? COVID is a new coronavirus but it‚Äôs not alien technology. No one knows if there are any long term effects of the virus or the vaccine.
2351	106399	@JUANFENNSKI @BBCBreakfast @MattHancock we will get vaccine for covid-19 (to reduce symptoms only of SARS COVID-2) so no virus would be eliminated !!! what a scam!!!
2352	201740	Today is a great day to get either your:‚Ä¢ First vaccine dose (only ~63% of my age group in SK has)‚Ä¢ Second vaccine dose (only ~48% of my age group in SK has)The unvaccinated are the reason for the variants. Y‚Äôall are little varient factories.
2353	106042	Can‚Äôt even have fun on Earth during a once in a lifetime pandemic anymore. Lorrrrrddddd, stop being so fatphobic! Nobody‚Äôs eating a donut everyday because they got a vaccine..... üòë
2354	107240	This is AWESOME news on the same day that I got my first COVID-19 vaccine. This is an epic deluxe cover of the already beautiful album that is LOVE IS AN ART.
2355	106087	Well, it's settled with my boss. I am going to the no appointment needed FEMA site tomorrow before work to get covid-19 vaccine #1. They are closing the site to first vaccines after tomorrow and I don't want to fight trying to get an appointment. They will make appt for shot 2.
2356	107300	@NetworksManager It‚Äôs more sinister. Covid19 ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù is going to be administered like this to the people who would NOT take the shot voluntarily.
2357	106176	@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre so worried about banning an app when all this commotion is going on in the world, and you haven‚Äôt even found a vaccine for COVID-19 üôÑyour pathetic
2358	106729	"It takes years to develop a safe vaccine. Either they already had one developed (nothing shocks me anymore) or they're bypassing all safety protocols to have this ""vaccine"" cranked out so quickly. Both sides of the political isle are sheep being led to the slaughter. SMH"
2359	106877	I am so tired of the insanity happening in the US. I am totally open to learning that HCQ is protective against Covid, but articles like this totally discredit their own objectives by making statements like ‚ÄúDr. Fauci who is an investor in the Wuhan Lab and the COVID-19 vaccine‚Äù
2360	106456	@latimes Trying to make sense of ppl like this. Four questions:Were these ppl and others of their persuasion given a trial vaccine in private to see if it will work?Do they believe they are immune to COVID19?Do they just don't care?Are they under a strong evil delusion, seriously?
2361	201611	I have lots of FRIENDS and FAMILY that have taken the COVID-19 Vaccine and all had the SAME EXPERIENCE. NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL.THIS IS THE TRUTH.The VACCINE will help us end this pandemic. IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET VACCINATED.PLEASE DO
2362	105895	I don't even like to take the flu vaccine because of it making me sick for a few days. If this Covid-19 vaccine is offered to me? I'll take it on camera. What's a few days of symptoms compared to the grave?!
2363	107172	@Jose_Freitas94 @realistgeo @KokeUSG It has nothing to do with COVID-19 and probably isn‚Äôt true in regards to any vaccine. I think at this point we can‚Äôt just believe everything we see in the internet
2364	106786	How is the government still promoting something that‚Äôs not #FDA approved then if you do get vaccinated you still can catch  #COVID19  why not create a vaccine for #cancer #diabetes  #hiv #aids
2365	201517	The man who got COVID last week and said it was mild *specifically because* he got vaccinated has now banned vaccine mandatesWhat an absolute fucking idiot
2366	106049	@irenegarth1946 Every person without vaccine protection is a potential incubator for a new variant! This virus is able to evolve swiftly to survive. If we want a normalised world we have to get ahead of #COVID19 not just patching up after it! We can beat it if we stop politicising it!
2367	201787	Grateful to the scientists and all involved for working so hard to produce this vaccine üëçüèΩüëèüèΩ #MondayThoughts
2368	105255	Just got my COVID-19 vaccine. No microchip detected. Didn‚Äôt have to renounce Christ. And everyone was really nice.
2369	107136	I am starting to think there will be games again without fans after reading of so many catching Covid19 new variant at this rate we will be lucky if fans can go2games on December 26/27th.I have had my booster but it doesnt stop1 getting Covid 19 only reduces how bad you get it.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2370	106803	If they mandate #Florida kids to go back to school I am going to decline that offer. No vaccine, no school. We'll homeschool.
2371	105641	i hope this COVID-19 vaccine works with others because i‚Äôm not putting something that we‚Äôre still experimenting with, inside my body. i don‚Äôt really feel like being a human test subject.
2372	105935	They actually were going to hype Santa in their vaccine pitch( hmmm... was this just advertising for their stock investment)ü§îü§î
2373	201546	@6abc @6abc the segment you just aired about the Dr. who just got the first Covid19 vaccine shot and then a few days later tested positive for Covid was completely irresponsible reporting. That Dr. did not yet develop full immunity or receive the 2nd shot... 1/3
2374	106823	I'm in favor of getting the #COVID19 vaccine, i just wish our #Governments would be honest about the side effects. Telling an alcoholic out there that the vaccine may not fully work is NOT going to encourage them to GET the vaccine. There are RIPPLES to things that you say &amp; do.
2375	106164	"@CoondogHog @ArkansasCovid This is really wrong headed.Considering that there may be no ""herd immunity"" with COVID19 we all need to do our part until there's vaccine, not just shelter those most at risk.BTW I take offense at the word weak! Fighting off cancer, being 65+, having asthma is not weak. üò£"
2376	107162	Now that we‚Äôve vaccinated the elderly &amp; those with certain conditions, just f‚Äông give anyone who wants a vaccine a vaccine already. They‚Äôre just getting stale &amp; thrown out.I‚Äôm mad because I just found out my brother contracted COVID-19 so close to the end of the tunnel.
2377	201674	The Ontario government is further accelerating the second dose interval for individuals who received their first dose of an AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to eight weeks from 12 weeks.
2378	106898	The other reason I am sharing is that there is so much misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. I am chronicling my experience so others can see the account of a person they know.
2379	107396	With #COVID19 spreading like wild fire this is the last thing we need. Rich countries should share the #vaccine with others to reach the immunity. If not we will live with this for a long time. #VaccineEquity #vaccineforall #coronavirus
2380	107515	Just imagine how many diseases would‚Äôve been cured if academia and industry from all over the world collaborated to take on diseases such as Cancer, Alzheimer and HIV to name a few same as they‚Äôve done with COVID-19 vaccine. Cancer will not be cured by  a research group..1/2
2381	105379	@darryn_briggs @chrislhayes It will NEVER be over.  COVID-19 is a coronavirus, and like all of its fellow coronaviruses, it is now permanently endemic.  And no, vaccines won't stop that, humans aren't the only reservoir, there are multiple animal hosts to the virus as well.
2382	201689	Ended my semester by getting my second #CovidVaccine. I am indebted to the scientists and healthcare workers who have been working so hard. Thank you to @moderna_tx and @WillCoHealth for both doses.Do your part‚Ä¶ remember to #WearAMask and #GetVaccinated to fight #COVID19! https://t.co/IuANI7051F
2383	106634	@CBSLA It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúconfirmed COVID-19 case‚Äù. It‚Äôs a continued case of stupidity because some decided not to get the wildly available vaccine. All the vendors will be out cash because someone doesn‚Äôt believe in science.
2384	106904	This is my issue. I have vaccinated my daughter but this Covid-19 vaccine is very new and I am concerned about the speed it jas been produced so I will not be rushing to take it.
2385	106241	"Just wait until they start telling kids to turn in their parents for not taking them to get the jab.How many kids will use this ""threat"" to get ______?How long until CPS is called on parents who don't get their kids jabbed?Think this can't happen? History says yes it can."
2386	105282	Every time I see someone who is not a doctor, immunologist, etc. comment negatively on the COVID-19 vaccine, I‚Äôm going to figure out what they do for work and make very uneducated comments about their profession. Stay tuned.
2387	105706	Having just spent hours researching, I'm concerned there has never been a vaccine for ANY coronavirus! I did see many 'happy-talk' reports that PROMISE a vaccine but know promises usually melt away like pockets of snow.
2388	107674	Anyone want to go raid a pharmaceutical factory for the COVID-19 vaccine and give it out to hospitals for free?
2389	107520	For all the long term good your vaccines do @sajidjavid you might as well be pedalling Snake Oil. Everything seems to suggest the vaccines are actually getting in the way of natural immunity. This could come back and haunt us üò°
2390	106790	@SRomanum @BNODesk Remember there is no vaccine for the common cold (a normal Coronavirus) at all. It's been 30 years and we don't have an HIV vaccine.  There may never be a vaccine.
2391	106251	They don‚Äôt care about the biggest killer ‚Äúabortion‚Äù in the black communities nor about police killing us but they somehow care ENOUGH so that we don‚Äôt die from a plandemic. If we don‚Äôt take the vaccine and everyone else does then they should be protected from us then rightü§î?
2392	105510	My goodness I can‚Äôt wait until they approve #covid vaccines for children. Always nerve wracking to have my kids get covid tests when they have a runny nose. If you‚Äôre still hesitant, get #vaccinated. It‚Äôs not just for you but for the kids too young to get the vaccine. #COVID19
2393	105936	"The ""% of available"" doesn't seem like a good metric, given that vaccines are shipped in huge boluses and vaccination occurs steadily over time. They're not going to get all of a shipment injected the day it arrives and then sit around doing nothing until the next one."
2394	106129	I remember when I went to get my first dose of the vaccine and they told me to come back in a week because they ‚Äúhad no stock‚Äù
2395	105487	"If you can't sue an industry that has zero liability...Who do we get to sue if we have a ""bad reaction,"" to this vaccine that was rushed through testing and can't possibly have been studied long enough to know any long term side effects, and particularly any reproductive risks?"
2396	105932	So prisoners are getting vaccines before proper civilians...so I'm thinking if you get arrested for not wearing a mask, you might get vaccinated...#COVID19 #COVIDSecondWave
2397	107309	even if the vaccine worked as intended, Covid was more deadly and there were 0 risk it would still be immoral to mandate it. This isn't something I'm willing to compromise on, I decide my own risk tolerance, the government does not get to do it for me. #COVID19
2398	106879	I really would love to know how many Americans are going to take the coronavirus vaccine? I‚Äôll say a prayer for you! They‚Äôll try to inject your kids while they are at school. WARN YOUR KIDS NOT TO TAKE ANY SHOTS IN SCHOOL. THEY WILL LIE TO YOUR KIDS TO INJECT THEM

2410	106663	So @BillGates will take the coronavirus vaccine publicly on camera but some loser anti-vaxxers like Haifa Wehbe and Carol Samaha  speak against it. Maybe they should stick to gold digging in Egypt.

2420	106851	I‚Äôm not a medical professional so I defer to med professionals on issues like this. My wife is a medical professional so I subsequently know many people in the field.The arguments I‚Äôve heard against young healthy people taking the vaccine outweigh the arguments for taking it.

2425	106285	@davidkurten What do you think vaccines do? Seeing as the 131,000 people who have died of Covid-19 in the UK also had immune systems, why do you think trusting one's immune system is an argument against getting vaccinated?

2428	105442	This is so critical given our current predicament (no organized plan in the U.S.) &amp; unreal effort it'll take to globally scale a vaccine. Trace, test, isolate to get cases low (did not happen in U.S.); develop therapies to speed recovery, reduce mortality; vaccine to prevent.
2429	106018	Question:Why does the president show no interest in taking the vaccine jab?This could have really inspired the rest of the population on COVID-19 vaccines.Is there something we don't know?Have you noticed the bigwigs no longer mask up?
2430	106872	People saying the #coronavirus is going to be gone in May are delusional. We are just going to have more tests, hospital beds, and preventative measures in place. This will not end until we have a vaccine.
2431	107188	If you get any of these vaccines there's a 100% (+-) chance that you will survive a coronavirus infection.
2432	107328	#Sinopharm uses one of the 'classic' #vaccine techniques, with an inactivated #CoronaVirus. Q: where did they get all that virus material from?
2433	107455	No it's not stunning. As a person who watched their dumbass governor fumble the initial response to COVID-19 and then be re-elected just in time to fumble the vaccine roll-out, it's not stunning. Having to deal with the death cult GOP's stronghold on my state is terrible
2434	107226	Except there's no vaccine yet, so how they know the size of the stockpile is anybody's guess...It's because they're lying. That's it. That's the guess.

2439	105658	@ShaneGrover2 @truthqst @TheLastSquatch @RealCandaceO Ok so do you get a seasonal flu shot?  I hope not because there is less data in each annual flu vaccine than 15+ months of Covid-19 vaccine.

2449	105724	@200belligerents @ZubyMusic In the UK we have reached a point where most people know someone who has died, or has long long term illness. It is not a trivial illness. Relative to the risks from COVID19, the vaccine is very safe indeed. Despite all that, no one is being forced to take the vaccine.
2450	107158	@starsandstripes Will there be a vaccine for the new strain of coronavirus?  I mean, it‚Äôs a virus, and they do mutate, just like influenza.
2451	106829	South Africa is not a poor nation and shouldn't get #coronavirus vaccines donations like countries like Zimbabwe. Our economy is too big to be in this situation. Our government is not competent. That is where the biggest problem is

2491	106830	Absolutely.  Vaccines in general are no good.  But, to rush it then try to force it people is scary.  They won't find out til later that there are problems and terrible side effects from the vaccine.  Not to mention, Bill Gates is pushing it...THAT is terrifying!
2492	106927	Clownish, yes, but it's also an important insight into how the media works in 2021.They're not going into that press conference with Murphy chasing a story on botched vaccine distribution or a nursing home death coverup.Their editors want clickbait. They're there to get it.
2493	107176	@JandJFlowers @phossils @TommyMacDC @Nike @Kaepernick7 That is not true! Now there is an effective vaccine out there. Anyone who does not take the vaccine and dies of covid-19 did in fact take responsibility for their own death. Those who discourage others from vaccines are strait up killers.

2495	107593	Unfortunately COVID-19 will get worse because it will gain more strength along with the flu in the winter according to Dr. Fauci, but I hope the vaccine is distributed to people who want it including me because I don't want to get the virus, and spread it to other people
2496	107243	Mid-way through my (vaccinated) bout of COVID-19 my take aways are;- Don't underestimate this virus.- Don't overestimate the vaccine.

2503	107107	@ty16097410 @HansDancin @AdamSchefter No the purpose of the vaccines is expose you to elements of the coronavirus so you can build up certain antibodies against the actual contraction of the coronavirus. Yes if you do get the vaccine It may lessen the effects. Truth: we don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs new virus to the human genome!

2514	107630	"It's because they tested these things beforehand. But people decided ""they rushed it out"" is the narrative because they choose to ignore everything that happened before the vaccine rollout. Like, how coronavirus was being studied before the 2019 variant happened."

2555	107269	The Covid19 pandemic is still spreading. The vaccines may or may not work. The chances of not working are higher. The deaths will keep on piling. My estimate of 10 million deaths is likely to be achieved despite the vaccines.
2556	105456	@Dan79596368 You kill me looooooool this is a false equivalence. We don't need COVID-19 vaccines in order to keep our jobs, get an education, buy food, all we need is competency or whatever

2633	106028	@CliveMyrieBBC @PhilipIngMBE @NHSBartsHealth Stop the preaching. Time will tell if you parents are safe raking this synthetic pathogen as it‚Äôs legally not a vaccine. I hope they don‚Äôt have any adverse reactions. Apparently it‚Äôs when those who have had the jab then meet the real COVID19 virus that the problems start.

2636	106537	I'm watching a Dr on tv saying blacks and Latinos are discriminated against when it comes to the coronavirus. Could someone please explain to me how? Are white people keeping it all for themselves? Who can't get a vaccine if they want one? Really, can someone explain it to me?
2637	106694	@datboyolly Half ml CoronaVac coming out of China based on pathogens. AZD1222 immune response out of Oxford. So they have already given details but given the fact that there has never been a vaccine for any strain of coronavirus, that's my point, that we should still be very worried.

2642	201585	Appreciated recieving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine today. An easy and streamlined process! Don‚Äôt tell my wife but I think the vaccinator had a crush on me @jostamp_18. https://t.co/Thcs5eqULP
2643	106221	@sissypantz Scientists can devote their time to the creation of a vaccine for coronavirusNobody needs dinosaurs...they always get out didn't they see Jurassic park 1, 2, 3, 4 , 5
2644	105956	@YRavenOFFICIAL @hennecd @iHeartApple2 @LegendaryEnergy You bring up a good point. Ivermectin is dirt cheap. If ANY chance it effectively treat COVID-19 it should be studied extensively. The US govt didn't bother studying it because if it worked out would prevent emergency authorization for the vaccine and it won't enrich big pharma.
2645	107270	@realDonaldTrump Anyone has a vaccine for this pandemic, maybe China has the answer their country is clean and they do not have more people with the infection and send doctors to Italy to help with the pandemic, at first hand the Chinese Government developed this pandemic
2646	106411	@Meditationsndz @americamag If they only wanted to engage #POTUS45 on issues he was sympathetic towards, why didn't they urge him to issue an Executive Order to the FDA to develop an ethical #coronavirus #vaccine free of aborted fetal cells?
2647	105911	Mf‚Äôs keep saying they don‚Äôt trust what‚Äôs in the Covid-19 vaccine as if they forgot they went to rehab twice for heroine. Like mf, you‚Äôre worried about the wrong needle.

2649	105342	If the #coronavirus isn't harmful then why do we need the #CoronaVaccine, huh? Explain that one liberals
2650	106493	our countries down here aren‚Äôt like america, we‚Äôve only started getting the vaccine last month &amp; only elderly/priority people are getting it. less than 3% of the population is vaccinated &amp; even so, they were already gonna donate to pacific countries... do your research?
2651	107422	@Annahar There is hope. In china and Australia and other different country they are using malaria and HIV medicine for coronavirus.And it is working.Plus a vaccine will be approved and done after couple of months. Take the right precaution U WILL SURVIVE
2652	105589	The #COVID19 vaccine news is great. Now, how do officials plan to sell it to Americans who are already saying they won‚Äôt take it?

2657	107384	@JuliaHB1 But Julia, there is no permanent vaccine for the flu which is coronavirus. Virus mutate which is why people need vaccinating every year or have a healthy lifestyle which keeps their immune system well. The later is more effective than any vaccine.

2659	106692	@sajidjavid The end game is getting EVERY man,woman &amp; child a digital ID (otherwise sold to you as a vaccine passport) they NEED this in order to impliment their financial reset &amp; credit social scoring system. (China Style) Covid19 is just the tool they use to get people to accept it
2660	107040	Misleading.If a vaccine was going to be available by that date we'd know.Trump may try and get part's of trial's skipped and fast track one.This is to set up a system as to how a vaccine will be distributed.Who first and so on.I don't have any trust in CDC.This is bull.
2661	107491	@gator_gum I think the provincial governments are hoping they can vaccine their way out of Covid-19 without having to admit it is airborne. The government wouldn‚Äôt like the investments that are needed if they admit it is airborne.
2662	107429	To all those pushing for the elderly to get the vaccine before the healthcare workers who are actually working with COVID-19 patients, even if the elderly get vaccines now it won't be safe for you to expose them on Christmas -- it takes three weeks plus another injection first.
2663	106179	Also thanks for the friendly reminder my friend... The vaccine will not replace what we do everyday. We still have to do it until everyone gets vaccinated.
2664	106395	The Oxford vaccine is safe and immunogenic. Now we need to know how effective it will be in reducing the risk of contracting COVID
2665	105208	@DaveColan That‚Äôs not even a comparable statement whatsoever. Drunk driving is illegal. Getting a vaccine is a choice. If you think not getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the same as drunk driving you really need to re-evaluate your thought process as a whole.
2666	107578	@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The vaccine will only work when people can get it. Eight months after this began &amp; the average American still can‚Äôt buy a disposable n95 mask. You expect me to believe Trump could manage distribution of a #coronavirus vaccine that requires 2 doses?Gaslighters gonna #gaslight.
2667	107379	Americans be like: my body my rules I‚Äôm not growing a third nipple, btw vaccines give u autism and turn u into a hairy latino
2668	105613	Our very trustworthy political leaders will get on national television and be administered a vaccine so that the people will gain trust in the vaccine. Sounds legit, hope the CDC has a whole link on how it's safe since Pence and Biden took it
2669	107302	Some physician in Italy refused the Covid vaccine. The answer to this is very simple: find another job because you will not be an MD anymore. #COVID19 #italy
2670	107169	The Brits.  The don't want to wear masks, the don't properly lockdown, no quarantine, no social distance. And now they don't want to use a vaccine. üëÄüëÄüëÄ
2671	106593	@guide_late @ethrop @The_RyN_2k @mamahibou @cyung5 It is not stoping the pandemic.. it‚Äôs a corona virus.. read up on them.. lots of coronavirus studies.. they mutate, it‚Äôs what they do, regardless of the vaccine and the vaccine does not prevent infection or spread of the virus.. so no social benefit to the vaccine
2672	107634	@MurkeNyou @mesosuchus @Ned_the_zombie @TitusNation Nope. The technology is not new, I never claimed that. But the actual pharmaceutical is new. It was developed last year. They did not have the genomics sequence for COVID-19 until the epidemic started. They could not make the vaccine until having that You lose.
2673	106474	I would like to give people the covid19 vaccine so when my son grows up, I can tell him that I helped in saving the world.
2674	105776	Virus may not be inactivated? Are you kidding me? Is that even a question to be asked? it‚Äôs the only bloody thing that differentiates a vaccine from the virus it is seeking to tame. Why isn‚Äôt this being investigated on a war footing?

EVER.
2677	106502	Over reaction to this omicron is remarkable.  $PFE just said vaccine is 90% effective.  Vaccines are safe and effective we‚Äôve been told.  This strain is less virulent we‚Äôve been told.  What is going on here?

2695	107385	@ccrazy45 @DanCrenshawTX Go with what your doctor says.

Ask the FDA about it.

2716	106207	@WillBlackWriter You do understand this is a mRNA vaccine?  If you have already had Covid-19 and survived your body has produced the exact same Covid protein as the vaccine is intended to stimulate to produce.  These idiots should really do their research.

2726	106299	I believe in opening up America but I also believe in mandating strict adherence to the CDC safety guidelines for COVID-19 and that all people should probably get the vaccine not be mandated to get it but do it on their own
2727	106933	Since 1921. So why does everyone think a vaccine for COVID-19 is going to be some kind of cure all for the virus. The virus will most likely never go away. If you want to listen to an expert on how to avoid getting the virus, listen to someone speaking on building...

2750	105825	@wave3news So here's another push by this in power to get vaccinated, but why? If it's a new variant, how can there already be a vaccine for it? The old vaccines are not going to be effective, yet they're pushing us to get jabbed now! Why? #vaccination #lies #COVID19 #control
2751	106625	I think there will be a vaccine. The question is whether it will be safe and effective or just another con like Trump University. I am betting on a con that will result in even more deaths.
2752	106533	Because vaccines aren't a magic talisman? They don't make you immune to Covid, they just give your immune system a better chance of fighting off an infection should it occur. This is literal 6th grade science stuff.
2753	106787	The coronavirus is a VIRUS, not unlike the common cold (rhinovirus) (I AM NOT A DOCTOR SO I COULD BE WRONG, DON‚ÄôT @ ME).There‚Äôs no vaccine for the cold. Y‚Äôall really need to shut the fuck up about a magical vaccine, because I‚Äôm really fucking tired of hearing about it.
2754	105882	Grown people in America can't comprehend the damage that their opposition to vaccines has caused.They don't get it that this virus is mutating weekly.Conditions change for US all weekly.Stop complaining about something antivaxxers have caused.Do what you should. Mask and vax.
2755	106302	The vaccine isn‚Äôt an immunisation. Every winter the NHS is in crisis. Fix the NHS. Oh and the vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop you catching or spreading the virus it‚Äôs just meant to stop you being poorly enough to go in hospital
2756	201673	@darakass I'm pro-vaccine and am fantasizing about a COVID19 vaccine daily but I won't trust a Nov 1st vaccine.

2760	105341	@jw_wilkerson @_StephanieMyers @OANN Are you telling me i have a greater risk of dying from this vaccine than the actual coronavirus. Hahaha. No thanks. This is hilarious why would i take the vaccine. Im going to say its against my religion
2761	106465	I say this to the person who seemed proud of having gone 46 years without a flu shot, are you going to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine when it comes out?I said I get the flu shot for myself and because my MD demands it and these are true BUT I also get it so that I don't
2762	106257	"""X number of people still haven't gotten the vaccine"" But do they want the skunk vaccine? They want the vaccine made for animals?? I thought we were done taking medicine made for our furry friends"
2763	106388	Though the threat of Covid-19 is real enough, why is SA and other countries being pushed into taking the vaccine, when China the origin of it all recovered using herd immunity?
2764	106398	@LebienHeure @guardian If you didn't need to get a flu jab every three months, why would you need to get Covid-19 boosters this frequently? It makes zero sense.
2765	105857	@DHSCgovuk @MattHancock We not be able to get a vaccine for the coronavirus been trying for years yet in 7 months you've managed to get one for covid19. No liability clause too. Yeah right! There has been no long term studies so how do we know what the effects are after 1 to 2 years.
2766	107670	Hmmm so children should take a vaccine they don‚Äôt need for a virus the vulnerable are protected from just because adults say so....? Not the best lesson to teach kids.
2767	107205	@KniskernMary @vgcrutchfield @RonFilipkowski I think my wife has an extra coupon you can use.  It gets you a free microchip enhanced COVID-19 vaccine with any two late term abortions.

2769	107476	@mickiedances @Sowzees @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC 1 a flu virus with a vaccine and acquired immunity. The other is a novel Coronavirus without any acquired immunity and no vaccine. Your hype is pathetic.
2770	107080	I have to option to get the Covid-19 vaccine today since I work in a long-term care facility, or I can wait a couple months for the second round....
2771	201660	Ugh. Someone give me the vaccine. I am back in the classroom this semester and I reallllly don‚Äôt want to get sick. I‚Äôve never been to the hospital  and I don‚Äôt want to go for the first time at 37. #COVID19

So they had done there trials like for Covid-19 which took about a year but by the time they were going to roll out the vaccine to the public the disease was as widely spread.

2779	105993	@SusanRLane @BrakTalk @William84214395 @ZeroFrucks @clairlemon There is not one covid-19 vaccine. They are all different.
2780	105845	Bill Gates warns against coronavirus vaccine going to highest bidder ‚Äî Oh, very well. Let it go to his kids (Billy's kids) free of charge. We don't want it, anyway. Besides, they're probably speaking of that wiccan broth Melinda pulled out of Cernunos ass.
2781	106310	Because they haven‚Äôt got their vaccine yet. Why? Because it‚Äôs not their turn yet. Until when? Until when? Harini je dah ada a few under thirties without any comorbidity issues died. And yet there are elderlies yang tak dapat vaccination date lagi.
2782	105858	Vaccines prevent infections in the first place. Governor Chaos wants you to get sick so he can make money on the treatments.
0	111083	@tamifairchild1 @KingMoyer @TheRightMelissa @RealCandaceO Indeed certain vaccines can in a small number of cause such responses. However, in those cases so would the virus being immaculated against. Actually, that is the problem with the more severe presentation of coronavirus (and I am concerned that a vaccine may be bad for some)
1	110702	@deep_biden the govt system has created corona.they want a depopulation. they only care about wealth, not humanity.Thats why we see idiotic restrictions, toxic vaccines and a couple variants of corona now,..What would be necessary is to get rid of the coronavirus wit chemikalsthesolution
2	110204	The Canadian HC @mckinnondavid blocked me for pointing this out, but Canada is screwing countries like ours with vaccine nationalism. Sri Lankans need to stop serving him breakfast
3	109871	I‚Äôm a consultant in ICU and we have lots of #COVID19 patients. We have great PPE and my risk is low. But it‚Äôs not zero. And I might catch it in the community anyway. The vaccine protects me. But it also protects my family. And that protects other families.
4	108890	Comparing the covid-19 vaccine with the smallpox vaccine if like comparing apples to fish.  You get away with this because people have no clue scientifically how they are made tested and then administered. Other then they are paying people and begging you to get the covid-19 jab.
5	201923	I (finally) have my appointment for the booster shot. I work from home and always wear a mask so I've been putting it off.Everyone should get their 3rd dose of the vaccine. The shots you got a few months ago are not good enough anymore. #Omicron #Covid19
6	111885	The first phase 1 trial for a Coronavirus vaccine occured today.  It only took 65 days from obtaining sequence to the first trial injection.  Fastest in U.S. history. Hopefully the trials will prove vaccine effective.
7	109003	Omicron came out like a week ago, they say they have a vaccine for it already, and then wonder why people are skeptical
8	110186	@Goalkickingguru They've been working on mRNA vaccines to tackle coronaviruses since the 2002 outbreak of SARs. Believe it or not, the first coronavirus was detected in animals in the 1920s.It's cute you think it was all new last year. Bless.
9	110122	No surprise there.Next will be Rump's snake oil vaccine to stop Covid infections @MaddowBlog  Beware!
10	110535	Reading comments on Facebook and getting excited that the plot twist in the COVID-19 drama is that once a vaccine is created it's useless because half the population refuse to take it
11	109635	@LolaNJ20 @davidmweissman @marcorubio These people get the vaccine first like they got the best medical treatment, no average American can afford, when they got infected just to tell everyone that Covid19 is just a mild flu.üôÑ
12	108476	@hellyboo778 Hi there, COVID-19 vaccinations are not currently mandatory in the UK, but are a legal requirement to work in some social care settings. It is the colleague‚Äôs decision whether they receive the vaccine or not. [1/2]
13	201919	As of Wednesday, 611,429 individuals had received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 166,131 have been fully vaccinated.
14	112294	I didn't hear discussion in the Senate COVID-19 hearing today that indicated that our scientists are interacting w/scientists around the world on vaccine development. Why not? Shouldn't it be an international effort to deliver the best vaccine to everyone?(Sen Burr mentioned it.)
15	109103	It has to be here everyone is flying all over the world bring it here or brining it there. But the good news is the vaccine might still work? I say might. No science at this point. All they have to do is reformulate 7.4 billion doses or is it 14.8 doses? I am moving to a desert.
16	109066	@DavidChalmers1 @CareyGercarey @LBC @NickFerrariLBC Interesting conundrum. How will you feel if he is offered it and takes your advice and refuses it. He then contracts COVID-19 and dies before Oxford vaccine is available. The Pfisor vaccine works for others but you advised against it. Not sure I could live with that. ü§î
17	110709	Extending is not the same as using it. It is there in case it is needed which is right in my view when we have no real date when all adults will be vaccinated in this country, (that is first and second jab) and too little knowledge yet regarding new variants. We are nearly there.
18	201929	I just got my Covid-19 vaccine, I‚Äôm so happy I could cry happy tears . #vaccinated Thank you to all the doctors, scientists and CDC for making this happen
19	110194	"Sources tell me Bill Gates just made an airborne coronavirus ""vaccine"" and the only way to stop it from getting in you is if you wear a mask. üò∑"
20	108710	@Linda36758099 I think they've been working on much better flu treatments, stuff that will boost your immune system in general to help you fight off whatever causes flu. I think that's what the non deepfrozen ones are, like AZ/Oxford one There ain't no covid19 so there can't be a vaccine1
21	110208	Why does an asshole like @marcorubio get to skip the line? Why waste it on someone who knowingly spreads the virus? The vaccine should go to hospital workers first.
22	108300	I‚Äôm not sure what to believe here. Surely he wouldn‚Äôt sacrifice his own child for political gain, but it‚Äôs Putin, so maybe he would? If there is a vaccine. Which there is probably not.  Sigh.
23	112588	If your employer requires a #Covid19 vaccine and you refuse to take it, you're getting fired for not supporting the values of the organization you work forNo one should support any product or company if they can't support their values
24	107733	@PutinsLapDog @RepThomasMassie So what happened when a fully  vaxxed person get the coronavirus again? The non-vaxxed get a refund?
25	108120	@JoeBiden If the vaccines work so great, why are vaccinated so afraid of getting Covid-19, you have to keep wearing masks? Plus being so scared of the unvaccinated, you fired them from their jobs. Forcing kids to get vaccinated when the risk is higher for them then Covid-19 is plain evil.
26	110920	.@JohnCornyn lies again.@JoeBiden called for every state, territory, tribe to open up vaccinations for all by May 1; not every person be vaccinated by May 1.Even if vaccines are open to all by May 1st, it'll still be a heavy lift.It takes 2 wks after each shot for immunity.
27	107703	From what I've seen around the world, the only assumption anyone can make (and I've had this assumption a long while) is that the #COVID19 virus is in the #vaccine.#Covid19UK #WearAMask ?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
28	110631	The #BoosterShot kicked my butt. Down with Fever. Aches. Arm hurts. But I am grateful to have the shot. I don‚Äôt want #COVID19 anymore. I‚Äôve had it 2x. And amazingly I am still walking the earth. The #VaccineSideEffects are worth the blessing of life! Get #vaccinated
29	111098	Poor lady. I hope she doesn't have any side effects. The way everyone is pushing this vaccine is unreal.
30	112113	Do you plan on getting on an airplane BEFORE there is a #COVID19 vaccine?#coronavirus #FundraisingTwitter
31	108444	@rebekahiknight @trekker34 @realDonaldTrump I don't understand... are there more or less deaths because of Covid19? If it's a hoax... why Trump worked so hard to provide us a vaccine?.Why the GOP are getting it? please don't follow their example and wait, essential workers deserve to get the vaccine first.
32	110353	This is what's going to HAPPEN if these STUPID people out there take this UN-NECESSARY VACCINE for a non-existent VIRUS that is nothing more then the COMMON COLD as Covid-19 nothing more then the flu and Pneumonia  masquerading as Covid-19 @JustinTrudeau
33	201905	I felt like I was holding my breath waiting for my grandmother to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Te amo much√≠simo grandmaüíõ @UnivHealthSA https://t.co/oV54KXBm1o
34	111814	My grandparents have yet to find the vaccine. The war crime hearings can wait, they deserve to rot in their cell anyway. Why is it so hard for our government to take care of the American people? They literally work for us.
35	109324	I‚Äôve always been pro-vaccines.  But after having a bad reaction to a pneumonia vaccine that took me to the ER this past May... I‚Äôm not going volunteer to be 1st in line for the COVID-19 vaccine. But I‚Äôll get it eventually. Probably.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
36	110861	@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump President Obama got the H1N1 therapeutics out in less than 2 months &amp; the vaccine out in 6 months. It is now past 10 months for the Covid-19 vaccine. So how is this a great achievement?? How has Trump done anything????
37	108320	Oh... oh no. It's going to be one thing to get everyone to even take the vaccine, but asking them to keep wearing masks?This pandemic is never going to end.
38	108630	@Europe_Awake_ @SethMacFarlane So this says they contracted delta variant from abroad‚Ä¶which might be America‚Äôs fault considering we‚Äôre providing untaxed hosts for it to mutate inüò¨but it is sad they‚Äôre all getting sick again‚òπÔ∏èI just don‚Äôt see where it blames the vaccine or COVID-19 (non variant)
39	201809	Happy to get my first COVID-19 jab today, but I'm angry that my mum is still yet to have her first. Corby Lakeside surgery had promised to get in contact weeks ago to arrange a special appointment because of worries about a possible allergic reaction, but still nothing.
40	109836	@able_pearl @Sea_2Lake @tina_reunite @Abn_RN No, the point is that you're much less likely to get COVID-19 if you take proper measures, including getting the vaccine, and if you do get it, you're less likely to need hospitalization and less likely to spread it because you're staying home and get over it faster.
41	111893	Admission: I was raised but a somewhat anti-vaccination father, and as a result, have always been very anxious about getting the flu vaccine.  To the point that I've never gotten it.  In fact, the covid-19 vaccine is the first vaccine I've ever received as an adult.
42	110991	@NationBreaking TSC has DIRECTED teachers to get COVID-19 vaccine within 7 days or be disciplined; they are not entitled to any RIGHT to their personal health? Will LEARNERS not vaccinated be EXPELLED from school? PARENTS not vaccinated barred entry from schools?! TSC must stop  being PUNITIVE.
43	111765	@AlexBerenson Can you please check into this Alex? I wonder if all the vaccines out are using fetal cells?
44	107796	@JWall714 @LAkersDLions @BleacherReport @evanmanivong @IlliniMGym You know how epidemiologist know that mRNA vaccines are low risk and effective? Because we‚Äôve used them on other coronavirus strains like H1N1. So please shut the fuck up and stop fear mongering if you can‚Äôt comprehend basic medical science.
45	110773	@Cleavon_MD @SusanSchutte2 So sorry to hear about this. My question for our @Cleavon_MD why are there people still dying from Covid-19 if we already have the vaccine?
46	107808	"Vaccine passports? They need to be free, private, and secure, but I don't think anyone has stepped up to the plate yet in the U.S. Who's gonna jump in to declare - ""There's an app for that!"" Until then we laminate. https://t.co/5OPToGYIlN"
47	110132	Strange how it is approved as long as no other treatments are available. Since there are other treatments, does that mean it isn‚Äôt safe or approved? Looks like it. Last vaccine approved has 49 years of testing‚Ä¶
48	107922	@paulabagwell3 @corybernardi @OslundArthur We'll see when you are exposed to the wild virus. I'd say you're the ignorant one. In previous animal trials for coronavirus vaccines all the animals died when they came in contact with the wild virus due to ADE. How confident are you feeling??
49	112185	Punjab has way bigger population then Sindh, but the #coronavirus cases in both the provinces are almost the same. Lafafa journalists, @NajamSethiShow ,  were saying that #SindhGovt has performed the best in this crisis, and had imposed a stricter lockdown. Where are the results?
50	109934	I stg on everything that is me I will absolutely 100% NOT get a coronavirus vaccine lmfaooo what a JOKE
51	108372	@GovBillLee And you are discouraging Covid-19 vaccination?   It‚Äôs personal, but the Flu vaccine is public?  How did you get so far under the thumb of the morons who worship the last president?  Why do you hate Tenneseans so much?
52	111746	‚ÄúOn the question of when a coronavirus vaccine may be developed and distributed, Trump said Americans ‚Äòcould have a very big surprise coming up.‚Äô
53	111969	@jasonmarcelTO @AliceMcGovern4 The follow up for the clinical trials have not even been completed...what do you not understand?This is still relatively new...we have also never mass vaccinated a human population for a coronavirus. You can't coerce people to take this vaccine...there are legitimate concerns.
54	111563	so quickly! The new coronavirus was only discovered a year ago and the technology that some of these companies are using to create a vaccine is cutting edge. During this Thanksgiving week I am grateful for this modern miracle. #GiveThanks

57	112327	There is no ‚Äúafter corona‚Äù. Coronavirus is here and it‚Äôs going to stay, vaccine or not. We won‚Äôt wake up in 2021 and suddenly the virus has died. But we cannot live like this forever, enough is enough. We need our new normal to look more like our old normal
58	109782	Ever wonder why there's never been a Coronavirus v*xx before? How about why there is no vaccine for dengue?
59	109455	@Mark_Whitelegge It‚Äôs like people who voted for Trump: they think he‚Äôs a demigod who can do no wrong üòë coronavirus isn‚Äôt the only threat to the future of humanity, stupidity is just as bad and we don‚Äôt have a vaccine for the latter.
60	107909	It was never going to be different with this COVID19 vaccine. Why would it be?! I don‚Äôt understand the think pieces and perseverations... It was always going to be this way. The west first, and when they eventually feel like it: everybody else. And that‚Äôs that on that üôÑüòí
61	112282	@GregHuntMP Will you assure us within the relevant margins of safety that the Coronavirus vaccine will be safe and effective when the vaccine is ready and that it will not be released before that standard is reached? DW
62	111754	Has anyone had the AstraZenica vaccine? Just wondering how it went. Any problems afterwards?#COVID19 #vaccine #sideeffects
63	111428	People saying they won‚Äôt get the COVID19 vaccine when it comes out don‚Äôt even understand that it won‚Äôt even be AVAILABLE to them when it comes out. The vaccines will come out in waves &amp; certain people in certain professions will get it 1st.
64	108606	Going to be a long time before a safe vaccine is developed. Ref. Dengue vaccine approved and then failing. When vaccine is avail there are 8b ppl to vaccinate. we've had safe polio vaccine for 50+ years but ppl in some places not yet vaccinated. No guarantees of quick relief

67	108786	@empireofthekop So all the ‚Äúvoiders‚Äù say it‚Äôs to dangerous to restart this season but feck lets get it going in August - Coronavirus will be here till a vaccine is found next year and if we start 20/21 what if there‚Äôs a second spike and say a ‚Äúvoider‚Äù is top there wouldn‚Äôt be a fuss?
68	112372	Warning: It's too early to get vaccinated. The clinical trial of vaccines for novel coronavirus has not yet been completed.
69	109874	it the coronavirus vaccine is not free, the only point in developing one is solely for pharmaceutical company greed because a significant percentage of the population won‚Äôt be able to afford it, and the feds don‚Äôt care. Sick.
70	110740	All the money in the world is not going to keep Covid-19 out of the schools UNLESS it's to purchase a vaccine once developed and proven to work.

72	110404	@Clint0nAnders0n @CTVNews You should actually do some research on the coronavirus vaxxx's they were producing after the SARS outbreak. It killed all the animals in the trials, and these vaccines they skipped the animal trials and went straight to humans. You can have my shot üòä

74	108902	@A2ZJIRWINKO Hello hypocrisy! You would think anti-vaxxers wouldn't be vaccinated at all given what they are preaching! I am not an anti-vaxxer for the record, since I got flu shots every year and I'm definitely getting the covid-19 vaccine too.

92	110609	@thistlethwaite7 @MML88902406 @BBCNews Cancer, mutations of the cell, is far more complex to cure than a Coronavirus.It's also worth noting, other coronavirus vaccines were already being developed, so the COVID vaccines not only had the entire planet's effort put towards them, but much of the work already finished.
93	109506	@JRubinBlogger This population probably overlaps with the antivaxxers who will not take the #COVID19 vaccines. These people might need their own country.

108	112362	I‚Äôm feeling like the coronavirus is going to be similar to the flu in regards to it being airborne, perpetually recurrent, seasonal and likely needing annual booster shots to bolster immunity.We may never get past it, and likely need to just learn to adapt through it.

123	109382	@Why are they trying so hard to blame pro vaccine politicians for pressuring for the vaccine/mask and not coronavirus????
124	109071	On my way to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Remember; even after you get the vaccine, you are not immune. Please continue to wear masks and stay home, not only for you but for others. Their safety IS your responsibility.
125	110733	I hate these little scare tactics...vaccine don‚Äôt prevent you from never getting covid it‚Äôs like the flu shot. You may get the flu after getting vaccinated but you may not get as sick or die from it. It‚Äôs the same for the covid vaccine

128	107819	Today‚Äôs #coronavirus briefing is a big #FluVaccine ad/push. What the hell is going on @POTUS? The flu vaccine is dangerous and has low efficacy. Your Task Force is already pandering it as a requirement for the fall along w an agenda to reduce vaccine hesitancy.  #VaccineAgenda
129	109972	@RobertKennedyJr @TLAVagabond no #vaccine for me, i am not a #guineapig, thex couldn't exctinct the flu and still no #vaccine against #HIV and other #disease, so it's stupid to believe that they have a vaccine against #COVID19 in 5 minutes compared to other deseases
130	111044	This is another reason vaccine passports are a joke. It's not the bubonic plague, and everybody who wants a vax soon will get one (I'm getting my first shot today, for example).
131	109740	Twat is back from his holidays.  Lies! There cannot be 100,000 people stupid enough to take a vaccine that we know is untested, rushed &amp; where the vaccine manufacturer has no liability for any side effects or death. @MattHancock please stop taking us for idiots. Keep yr poison.
132	108966	250,000 people in the U.K. have volunteered and are in trials for the coronavirus vaccine, is it just me that thinks they are crazy
133	108224	Why a vaccine for a virus less deadly than flu? And why give flu vaccines when effective rate is so low? Viruses mutate. Vaccines cannot keep up with mutations. Are vaccines a way to accomplish Agenda2021 &amp; Agenda2030? Heard of Georgia Guidestones? Research &amp; trust in Jesus now!

137	109520	That's what herd immunity is all about: those that are physically unable (not paranoid conspiracists -- they don't get a pass) to receive the vaccine are then protected because everyone else got it.

161	111475	@LexyDKat @SheriLoCascio @mimimcg07 The science is there. A commitment to safety via nationwide vaccine is not there. This virus has been allowed to mutate.

325	108180	For what? Let them die if they don‚Äôt want to wear a mask or get the vaccine, start having people sign waivers and refuse medical care when they get sick
326	109005	@CathyBilsky @mmpadellan Oh please. The vaccines don‚Äôt have any virus or other infectious material in them. They cause your body to make copies of a harmless piece of the coronavirus, so you will not, and cannot, get COVID-19 from the vaccine.
327	109059	This will clear the wrong notion surrounding this matter and put the facts in place that the covid19 vaccines are still under clinical human trials and those so-called vaccinated are human test subjects to this whole process whether voluntarily or forcibly done.

474	111661	@fmanjoo The Daily had what I thought was pretty condescending episode yesterday on how some people will probably not get the Coronavirus vaccine when it comes out. But... in these circumstances, suspicion towards a vaccine that comes out in this regime seems very reasonable.

480	107857	@WalshFreedom And the vaccine at this point in time is the only way to some kind of freedom and will ensure the hospital system will not close their doors to everyone, not just COVID.

484	109053	@DonaldJTrumpJr I don't see the reason why a Vaccine Passport is needed. When you get your vaccine you get a CDC issued COVID-19 Vaccination Card. Once you get your first dose, you'll be issued a vaccine card. The vaccine card will have the name of the vaccine, the date received and where got it

489	112603	@Cherry3142today @BernieSanders This is the equivalent of, 'I got coronavirus and survived, so no one should get a vaccine after me. They should suffer like I did.' If you understand the pain of debt, have some empathy for those who are still suffering.

499	112712	@CNN So its as effective as the yearly flu vaccine we all are supposed to get. Doesn't guarantee immunity, but is enough to suppress it till next year.In other words, the coronavirus vaccine may be just another flu vaccine. A yearly dose to keep the immune system chuggin along.

524	109155	@Steele_Ink @HarleyPeyton @DanCrenshawTX So ADE has not been seen in COVID-19 vaccines, but it has been seen in RSV, measles and the dengue vaccine
525	112150	I personally do not blindingly trust the Covid-19 vaccines like the silver bullet. This is due to all vaccines we have are not perfect ones and at the same time, the coronavirus has aggressively evolved and mutating all the times, and these viruses seem to never give up, but they
526	111675	This is true with COVID-19 ‚Äúvaccines,‚Äù as the shots do not make you immune; you can still get infected, and they do not prevent you from spreading the virus if you‚Äôre infected.
527	111489	So their vaccine reduced the absolute risk of covid by .24%.The world will end unless we get everyone hurdled into camps until they get these vaccines.
528	107812	@JonathanTorren9 @cmyeaton Did you know that we have never made a vaccine for a coronavirus successfully in humans? Most were mild. Only SARS and MERS were attempted to my knowledge. Both unsuccessful.

556	109924	@jackieohughes @RoadMeetsFeet @Outside_Margina @ClareWilsonMed @IndependentSage No, I absolutely wasn't. Please don't speak for me.And if it wasn't unique why did we not already have vaccines &amp; treatments for it? It's a novel coronavirus that gained pandemic reach.
557	112069	or, is it like what's happening here in the U.S., #vaccines made for #COVID19 may not be effective against #COVID21 #VariantsOfConcern
558	108344	@tedcruz How the hell does it make sense that You and your whole Leadership Party got the vaccine, but Will not agree to a new COVID-19 Bill? GTHOH.
559	112076	To deal with the virus, it is impossible to rely on group immunity. Vaccine is one of the most effective means. However, in the United States, the vaccine may face another problem, with one third of Americans refusing to receive the new coronavirus pneumonia vaccine.
560	108102	It‚Äôs unacceptable that disabled people aren‚Äôt prioritized for the vaccine in CA.People can‚Äôt ‚Äújust stay home‚Äù when they need to attend regular doctors appointments and have to work to pay for said healthcare, especially because they‚Äôre disproportionately impoverished.
561	109902	I just received notification that I will be getting my first #COVID19 vaccine on Friday. I am so incredibly grateful for this opportunity I could cry.
562	111583	The sheer scientific feet behind this vaccine is extremely moving to read about, not only for the human ingenuity but for all the implications this technology has for cancer and other diseases
563	109796	It is RIDICULOUS they, who have denied the virus existed, took few to no precautions will get this vaccine first.  They should refuse to get it and insist it goes to local hospitals and nursing homes.
564	110935	@sarahkhan557 It‚Äôs crucial! I just learned from an Nobel laureate immunologist that the vaccine helps the body create antibodies in the bloodstream but the virus can still come in through the nose and attach to a cell as the nose has less antibodies (one would need a puffer vaccine).

565	202042	Okay, although if someone told me a possible side effect of taking the covid-19 vaccine was that I might become the Incredible Hulk, it wouldn't necessarily be a deterrent. As long as my CGI was good.
566	108189	Friends, the vaccine will be available in a few short months. Hope is on the way. #PositiveVibes #Hope #coronavirus
567	110269	Not gonna blame anyone for calling this overkill on the NCAA's part, but the players/program knew the rules and risk they were taking in not getting the vaccine/educating the team. This is sad, but completely preventable. Stop turning common sense into a political debate.
568	112003	Not saying this is BS but let‚Äôs count the days until the vaccine is widely available. I think the words ‚Äúincredible speed‚Äù may not mean what they think it means.

575	108359	@cspanwj Wasn't going to take any COVID-19 vaccine anyway. The caller from Michigan is why people don't take vaccines. Don't lecture me on what I should  do. She complains about her neighbors not giving her an explanation. Excuse me. No one has to explain to her about their choices.

580	112125	I heard if you have a Krispy Kreme right after getting the vaccine it deactivates the bill gates microchip and you just wind up protected from covid. Just something to think about...
581	109989	"Apparently there's a person in the world who knows how to stop Coronavirus. I'm all in. Tell me exactly how. Not the preventative measures that I've been taking for 5 months, but how to ""stop"" it. At the same time I'll ALSO hope for a vaccine. It's not either/or. This is so lazy"

595	107954	We need a vaccine that stops the spread. We may never get that. My question is:Does COVID19 have the ability to mutate during the time a vaccinated person is infected?#WearAMask
596	112164	@Mememamamimi @RCObsGyn @MidwivesRCM Why would this vaccine be any different from other flu vaccines? The annual flu vaccine is offered to primary school kids as a nasal spray.

607	111690	Covid 19 is not going away until there is a vaccine. Because people are stupid and greedy. Hopefully there will still be people alive then.
608	112660	Just got my booster yesterday. Go ahead and get yours ASAP if you‚Äôre in one of the advised groups, or go ahead and start getting vaccinated if you haven‚Äôt yet! This has all been going on for so long with too much suffering. We can beat this if we do our part and get others to.
609	111645	@sailorrooscout Hi Chise üôÉ Do you have any info on whether people‚Äôs immune systems get extra immunity if they‚Äôve had 2 x vaccine doses plus a booster, and they are then exposed to coronavirus, but don‚Äôt have a breakthrough infection?

675	110168	Why is it literally impossible for me to find a place to get a Covid-19 vaccine??? I‚Äôm in Michigan, and every pharmacy I check won‚Äôt schedule me an appointment because they‚Äôre supposedly so incredibly booked up!!!
676	111071	Of course you dont have to get the vaccine, as someone who wants the pandemic to end, I am going to do so in order to help. Don‚Äôt say you want covid to end but won‚Äôt take the vaccine cause you use facebook as a reference.
677	202367	@amishclone @benjimast I am scheduled for my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday. After 1st dose my only side effect was a sore arm. Think the vaccine is a very important tool in the COVID-19 fight.
678	201879	Walk in vaccine slots at @TeamQEH today and tomorrow. Had yours yet? If not then pop in and get the jab and the protection it offers üëç
679	110188	@MayorOfTwitr @TeaPainUSA Not only is the covid-19 virus running wild but so is the stupid virus &amp; unfortunately the stupid will never have a vaccine.
680	108977	@saywow22 @Glamma726 @SeunOwonikoko @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump You will be forced to take a vaccine with Covid19 and a microchip very soon.  Fauci &amp; Gates are working on it right now.  Your every move will be tracked.  Trump it trying to stop this but you will be first in line it appears.
681	202170	Going for my second #COVID19 jab today. I couldn‚Äôt be more excited, because I want to protect myself and people around me #VaccinateToSaveSouthAfrica #GetVaxxedRightNow #VAXXED
682	202225	Feels so good to get my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. I feel so much more at ease for myself and my family. I can‚Äôt wait until this is available for anyone that wants it! I can finally see some light at the end of the tunnel üôèüèΩ
683	111393	@TheDamaniFelder Good idea BUT if they will get just the REGULAR flu vaccine....and pretend to have taken the Covid19 vaccine?
684	109478	@BrianReymann @NolteNC I see so doesn‚Äôt this apply to just about any coronavirus which we‚Äôve known about since at least the 60‚Äôs? if vaccines/antibodies don‚Äôt protect you then we‚Äôre to be locked down and worship your mask god forever?Why not before?Absolutely bonkers, not logical.
685	111535	@johnjamesrando @ralph44668932 @shellity I haven‚Äôt met any one who is anti coronavirus vax and just that one. They‚Äôre either true antivaxxers and are against all of them or they‚Äôre conspiracy theorists who think alien pedophiles are going to track them with the vaccine.
686	111453	Who the hell is going to pay for AE‚Äôs if the parents‚Äô don‚Äôt consent? My kid certainly doesn‚Äôt have enough to pay for the bills from his myocarditis hospitalization and follow ups. These vaccines are immune from any financial liability. I‚Äôm genuinely curious how this would work.
687	202150	my coworkers and I are spacing out our second covid-19 vaccines so we don‚Äôt all end up missing work the same day if we have bad side effects ü§™half our coworkers said it was the same as the first, the other half said it was a day of fatigue, fever, aches, chills, etc.

Never in my life have I had the flu never in my life have I had a flu vaccine. I will get the coronavirus vaccine b4 end of yr.

692	107813	Thalidomide is used today in the treatment of multiple myeloma, and it is very effective in the majority of cases. My mother took it for 10 months. It's not a vaccine, and there is no connection or comparison to any new COVID19 vaccine, unless you're a scaremongering COVIDIOT.

696	112560	Have you asked the Fed Government what they are doing to rectify their bungled vaccine rollout, or why they haven‚Äôt opened up purpose built quarantine facilities? I‚Äôm just going to assume the answer to these questions is no, because you are not a fan of the truth/facts.
697	107707	@NoobRobot2 @AP No it‚Äôs not! It‚Äôs a vaccine you have to get each year weather you‚Äôve had COVID-19 or not! Flu shot isn‚Äôt a cure it‚Äôs a vaccine
698	110327	@donach69 @FrankPlutonium @paulmasonnews They cannot avoid the inevitable. Coronavirus is now an endemic virus. Even when there is a vaccine people will die from it. New Zealand is just delaying the inevitable.
699	112313	Maybe they should have just let COVID-19 run through the world one time??? I mean what kind of logic is that? Just don‚Äôt get the vaccine, nobody is forcing anyone to get it, including you.. Like When are these hoe ass bitches gonna shut the fuck up? They make 0 sense‚Ä¶
700	109562	@tvcoh4 @JoeBiden Coronavirus is like the flu.  It mutates and the vaccines are already ineffective and virus has run its course by the time vaccines are made.  Which is why we have 1,000 flu vaccines and influenza is still here to stay.
701	109282	there is not vaccine for sars,,,mers,,,ebola...so what makes you to believe there will be a vaccine for covid19?
702	110783	Just got my first COVID-19 vaccine shot at Walmart! And I even got a Mountain Dew Baja Blast, straight from Taco Bell! Am I awesome, or what? My second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for May 22nd, Pac-Man's 41st anniversary! Coincidence, perhaps? I think not!
703	109915	I feel like the COVID-19 vaccine is going to be how the Zombie Apocalypse begins.But, let the record show, I say this for every vaccine created recently ü§£ü§£ü§£
704	112850	"@suzost Good grief - for once I agree with Farrakan!Coronavirus vaccines are *all* potentially deadly due to the known fatal twist of ""immune enhancement"" - which has PLAGUED prior vaccines in the category.The idea of giving ANY corona vaccine first to blacks is ""you first"" at BEST!"
705	112913	@illumiwookie @CovfefeKatie Coronavirus isn't ebola. Even 200,000 deaths is low. Expecting to shut everything down until it magically goes away or a vaccine is developed is unrealistic, child-like thinking. This is a deliberate attempt by liberals to destroy America and blame it on Trump so he don't win.

707	109519	So many parents like myself have waited for this news: the CDC is officially recommending the Pfizer vaccine to children ages 5-11. Widespread vaccines are the only way we‚Äôll beat this pandemic, and I encourage all parents to get their kids vaccinated as soon as they can.
708	112758	Ffs fed up with this anti-intellectualism. Please get the vaccine. I get my second dose tomorrow, and I can‚Äôt wait.
709	108749	I'm surprised they are not using puppies and kittens to make this vaccine or better yet bats they should be using bats as the Covid-19 came from bats so let's use bats to create a Vaccine to combat Bats if that even makes sense just like their vaccine makes no sense
710	108209	It it's only 12%, why are there still mandates from Trudy? Why the hell is the tantrum-thrower-in-blackface getting in the way of a nation getting back to normal?If vaccine rates are anywhere near what the propaganda says, why are they still even bothering to advertise them?
711	112281	Wait until they start dying ( which they will)....do people still not think this is all about control.Keep jabbing your child or he can‚Äôt go to school...he can‚Äôt do anything...This is coming our way unless mandates/ passports  are STOPPED NOW
712	112640	I have taken the flu vaccine &amp; still got the flu. Why? There are different strains, they guess which strains will be available &amp; create vaccines for those. The strain you get may not be in the vaccine. A Covid-19 vaccine may not protect you. Practice wearing your mask now.

715	108674	@BraincoralMusic Yes which is why they ‚Äúextended‚Äù the coronavirus act 2020 for another 6 months,because if that ends,so does the emergency powers meaning no more vaccines.I just didn‚Äôt know if something had been announced about over 65s like they have for under 30s
716	107684	Garbage take right here. Get the vaccine. The only way we get back to anything even remotely close to a normal life is if we all get vaccinated. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the only way. Tired of wearing a mask? Want to travel? Want to hug your friends? Vaccine. It‚Äôs the only way.

750	108306	@IiiLacour @_bethani @Mrknowitalll_ @BarkyBoogz Exactly. We never needed a vaccine before bc coronavirus was just mild colds so they never researched to make a vaccine until sars in 02 bc SARS was different and they needed to study it and create a vaccine just like now
751	110267	Ayan, ha. If any of these vaccine brands are offered to you, you should please get them already. Wala nang arte-arte pa.
752	109388	@senpaicoffee To further break it down for you since you are slow, once a variant comes out, we will have to adjust the current vaccine to address it. Its called Covid-19 because there were 18 previously known versions of the virus prior to the pandemic just not as deadly or contagious.
753	109132	Lmao this is the footage my local news used to show Seattle vaccine testing for Chinese virus. Is any of this real?
754	111267	I have four people who live in my house who are over 60 I'm a diabetic and to take the vaccine would we have to all take it at the same time is there a chance that if only one takes it that they could transfer the coronavirus to the others who didn't take the vaccine
755	110266	If after having the vaccine you can still carry and pass the virus on what is the point of the healthy and low risk having it ??

770	108748	@JL4486 @BMoreBirdsNest valid to wonder, if a Coronavirus can be this troublesome, why wasn't there a general vaccine developed for it before?  We know this isn't a new family of viruses...only real difference with this one seems to be a longer carrier period.They've been studying these, why no vax?
771	111159	We will never see it because it doesn't exist. Rick is right...he keeps promising it like it will miraculously appear, just like the Coronavirus vaccine he promised.  Even if he did rush something through, I AM NOT TAKING IT! I will stay in my house until Joe get into office.

792	109897	@RN_Destiny Now they are saying that the vaccines may wane after 7 months. If vaccinated you can still can get COVID-19 and you can still pass it on. So what is the point of the vaccine? Don't think many know what's going on and the vaccine is a trial drug.

795	108154	If this is true, then why even have a Phase 3 trial if the vaccine is being approved before all trials are complete? ü§îü§î
796	111116	AstraZeneca was always a tier two vaccine. The ‚Äúget any vaccine‚Äù advice seems very flawed in hindsight. There‚Äôs a reason the Americans never approved it.
797	109620	@JoeBiden Masks? I‚Äôm not seeing coronavirus in my orbit. We are not admitting few if at all   In my orbit. And, we are not seeing any Coronavirus patients die in my orbit. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump we have tests, meds, ventilators, and now, vaccines. You have zero clue.
798	109568	Cuba made their own vaccine AND everyone is going to get vaccinated all while under blockade by the USA. Meanwhile the pandemic is getting worse in America
799	109532	@Jessica28000244 @redpop86 @science_cited Your opinion matters very much. Please keep sharing!! :)Our opinion, no coronavirus vaccine has ever been deemed safe. Don't think this will be any different. Faster they go, more unsafe it is, more mistakes made. No mandates = No concern
800	202224	I swear I feel like my arm is slowly turning to a painful brick after taking the COVID-19 Vaccine, seriously my arm is so soreüòñüòñüòñ
801	110228	Just like the #PPEshortage when a vaccine becomes available, there will be a shortage, we won't get any or we'll buy useless vaccines. Another #ToryCovidCriminalMismanagement in the making.
802	109991	@PMOIndia It is very difficult to encourage the people's to take the Covid-19 vaccine because of different rumours, for this my suggestion to GOI Please launch the INSURANCE POLICY for post vaccination period which will be covered disabilities and mortality because of any reason.
803	110875	@RexChapman Then he went on to compare the research being done for a vaccine to the coronavirus to the Manhattan Project in which the research ended with the death of a projected 225,000 people and nuclear warfare is still something we are worried with to this day. Not a good comparison.
804	111358	Hello, just want to say na the vaccine we have now for COVID-19 is for EMERGENCY USE ONLY. DONT GET ME START WITH UNG MGA ANAK NYO NA PA-VACCINE-AN COZ BITCH THOSE VACCINES ARE DEVELOPED AND FDA-APPROVED ALREADY.
805	109677	Do you have ANY idea how stupid you sound? Get an FDA approved vaccine (Regenerson NOT FDA approved) and you don‚Äôt get Covid19 or you get such mild symptoms you DON‚ÄôT have to go to the hospital!!  Stupidity will kill you!
806	109951	@isonwilm @AaronCanen @ostrachan @Antithesis_Pod Covid-19 has statistically been much worse than the common flu on a large-scale. The goal is to minimize the amount of deaths while we reach herd immunity. I agree, people should choose for themselves if they get the vaccine or not but there is no doubt that they have so-far...
807	201842	@JulesB_07 So very sorry to hear this Jules. In my opinion, all Police Officers, should have had a Covid-19 Jab along with NHS Staff. All frontline Workers.üò¢üôè
808	109083	@b51507829 I don't even understand her point? Like does she not understand that coronavirus is what causes the common cold, and SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly variant of the coronavirus? RNA vaccine research has been happening for nearly 2 decades. I don't...what?
809	111790	@BostonGlobe Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.

815	111138	Is there any sane person in this world who would resist to take a covid-19 vaccine ?If somebody resists, we don't want such creatures
816	111386	What if the vaccine fails and y‚Äôall gonna force us to take it?? I‚Äôm getting an attorney and a bail for you delusional bitches
817	109197	@livemint Coronavirus has to get their right to complain coz vaccine and lockdown weakens his business..
818	109171	The way to go is e-learning and contact tracing solutions during this covid-19 vaccine free period. It saves direct Dr contact with clients and it keeps educating possible. We have these solutions in case you share my view.
819	109284	Heads up - the vaccine helps to reduce / eliminate the symptoms of the #coronavirus -they don't know yet if the vaccine actually stops the virus from SPREADING. Plus - you need TWO DOSES. So until people QUIT DROPPING DEAD -we still need to wear a mask -practice social distancing
820	201924	First #COVID19 jab done. Wow! That sore arm kicks in fast! üò¨Superb level of care and welcoming staff from @nhscroydon_ My nurse, Karen, was wonderful - so helpful üíô#NHSheroes
821	202248	The weather is miserable, lockdown is still boring, but today is a better day than most - my mum has had her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.
822	110720	If Americans were a truly adaptive and compassionate people, we would all just shave our heads and not give a shit what our roots looked like until a vaccine was developed.But, we're only two months into this thing and already threatening Civil War.#COVID19 #MichiganProtests
823	109399	@ThePubliusUSA @AdamParkhomenko There isn't and never has been a vaccine for a coronavirus, not foing to happen with this one either. Been what 18 years since SARS? Where is that vaccine, how about MERS?
824	112900	@TomGPritchard @BigManPauly @RexChapman So it‚Äôs ‚Äòonly‚Äô 2-3 times as deadly as the flu but then add in the fact that we don‚Äôt yet have a vaccine for coronavirus and suddenly it‚Äôs about 10 times more deadly. AND if the vaccine is as effective as the flu vaccine it will still be 2-3 times as deadly.
825	109557	"This is what what you get when you search on the Mass. vaccine site  today and filter for  Only Sites With Known Availability:""No locations match this criteria."""
826	112692	Apparently scientists have never produced a single approved vaccine or anti-viral drug for ANY coronavirus. Betting the well-being of an entire country on the assumption there will be an effective virus is poor reasoning.
827	110885	And this is EXACTLY why @CalforNC told @SenThomTillis last night that he‚Äôd be ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù to take a vaccine. There is no conceivable reality on planet earth in which a safe and effective vaccine can be studied, approved, manufactured, and distributed within weeks.
828	202020	Moderna, Vaccine, COVID-19 Vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine - Chattanooga, Tennessee - Moderna Vaccine.  I will receive my 2nd dose on 1/28/21 at 3pm.  No side effects.  Arm mildly sore for 2... SafelyHQ https://t.co/LWfpaWHxCF https://t.co/XL6oaCpQCp
829	111753	The only acceptable reason to not get the vaccine is if you would physically die from getting it. Nothing else
830	110582	@MDWaters1975 @Annakhait 1.  Took Coronavirus seriously and prioritized vaccine.2. Infrastructure, our roads are crumbling and need repair.
831	111741	‚ÄúThe rules for Covid-19 vaccines are clear: Vaccine providers are not allowed to bill patients, period,‚Äù Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. ‚ÄúEveryone can get a vaccine for free, whether they‚Äôre insured or not.‚Äù
832	201951	@MKBHD @MKBHD ; I've been testing the vaccine for the last 2 years, and here's my review and final impressions.And thanks to @dbrand for sponsoring the video. Get your COVID-19 vaccine skin in the link below.
833	111559	If you took the vaccine, the vaccine works, and you go into the restaurant,you go into the bar,you go to the store,you go to the sporting event,and you go in there and someone else didn‚Äôt take the vaccine,why do you care?
834	108681	After the hype about Moderna‚Äôs mRNA coronavirus vaccine, I wrote about why Oxford‚Äôs vaccine, which instead uses an adenoviral vector, may be safer. Now AstraZeneca got $1 billion from the US to develop the vaccine with Oxford. Here‚Äôs the science of it all:
835	109051	So the same people who called this virus a liberal hoax and refused to wear masks will be the first ones to get the vaccine? I just want to make sure I have this right... Appalling.
836	107746	Yesterday, the University of Windsor announced mandatory vaccines for all students &amp; staff. Wondering why my Alma mater, @McMasterU hasn't done so. When did we start coming last, Mac? üòü
837	109435	If an mRNA vaccine was approved for coronavirus, it would be the first of its type. ‚ÄòIt's a very unique way of making a vaccine and, so far, no (such) vaccine has been licenced for infectious disease,‚Äô said Prof. Bekeredjian-Ding.
838	109980	Having worked in a vaccine lab before I hope people realize just how /hard/ and costly it is to even begin to test and research different hypothesizes.Microbial labs take time. From inoculating, to growing, to producing- thats days maybe a week depending on wht you're working on
839	108388	@LanaKay11 @SpringSteps @HerStr8RightTho @adrienne_haddad I took the vaccine so I would be protected against COVID19. Just like I get flu shots and tetanus boosters. You don‚Äôt want the vaccine? Fine. I got it so I could hang out in bars or fly with unvaxxed people. You made your choice to NOT get vaxxed. Don‚Äôt belittle me for my choice.
840	110361	@washingtonpost #Covid19 It's been here for years. Everyone has had it or is getting it. It's that we are testing for it now. We didn't before. The #Covidvaccine has also been in production and administered to livestock for years. Just research it then you will know.. #COVID19 IS NOT THE KILLER.
841	112283	Questions for #COVID19 #VaccineMandates 1. How does me getting vaccinate help?2. If COVID is so bad, why not just let me die like an ignorant idiot?3. How can the FDA possibly have long term data on a vaccine that‚Äôs only existed for 8 months?Sincerely,Had Covid, still here
842	112443	We don't know the severity of the coronavirus. Downplaying it is  detrimental to planning for the worse, and hoping for the best. Most worrisome of all is that there is no vaccine. It could take up to a year to get one. First, they need to  identify this particular virus.  Scary.
843	202382	Delighted to announce that I am being put on the waiting list to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. All that needs to happen now is for me to be referred for a Covid-19 vaccine. But, this is a first step and an important step in my journey to receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.
844	112564	Anyone who is an #AntiMasker is probably also an #AntiVaxxerBut if they're not an #AntiVaxxer, they should go to the back of the line for a #Covid19 vaccine shotIncluding #trump and all #GOP politicians

Negative COVID19 PCR test results back today though wasn‚Äôt really expecting otherwise, just my body‚Äôs response to the vaccine (same essentially as to second jab).
846	107940	But it is going to take them at least a year to get the vaccine to everyone? So would they start off in India
847	110335	Interesting.ü§î So Countries pay millions or billions for companies to make the Coronavirus vaccine in turn they charge for releasing it. Someone is making a huge profit here.
848	202036	I read online that you need to wait just for 2 weeks after getting Covid19 symptoms to get the vaccine , I had the symptoms but my report was negative and it's been 3 weeks now so I am gonna try and book a slot now.
849	108888	@GMB So @MattHancock @DHSCgovuk is it one jab or two? Do the poor get one jab and @Conservatives and their cronies get two?This mixed messaging and cronyism doesn't help the fight against #coronavirus or support the idea we're in it together!#VaccineStrategy

853	110295	@j_mcelroy And if the test shows positive then all you can do is self-isolate. There is NO vaccine to cure you.So , if you believe you have covid19, just do the right thing and self-isolate immediately. There is NO vaccine to cure you.The fix is the same either way.
854	110588	Dear Boris, nice way to put it, you make it sound looks like Britain has developed the Vaccine, its German from Biontech, Scientists are German of Turkish Origin. Produced in BelgiumIn any event I must congratulate you, a good old Eaton boy manages to fool others

858	112535	@NikkiHaley would like us to believe that #capitalism is going discover the #COVID19 vaccineWhat she leaves out, as so many GOPers and rugged capitalists do, is that billions of #taxpayer  money is going into the initial research to jumpstart the researchIt's an ensemble act
859	109848	@davidaxelrod I can‚Äôt judge anyone‚Äôs need to ignore scientific facts during a Global pandemic- but- if it doesn‚Äôt work out for you, I‚Äôm just one step closer to getting the coronavirus 19 vaccine once its developed.#TrumpHasNoPlan

862	112681	Important Question!If as Lying Justin Trudeau claims this whole Virus Caper he has allowed to permeate Canada isn't over till a Vaccine is found (about 18 Months) WHY isn't a Vaccine being pursued to eliminate CoronaVirus Period?
863	108825	@JillHoganRE @CBSNews Why after mo. being told are you &amp; others so ignorant what the vaccines will/will not do? Fully vaccinated people can get covid19!! They can get sick; they can spread it to others. Ea. time COVID infects someone it has potential of mutating beyond what vaccines can handle.
864	108067	We‚Äôve doubled down on vaccines, this keeps happening everywhere. Everyone needs to know after you get the vaccine STAY HOME for two weeks.  The data suggests that you are more vulnerable immediately after the shot for some reason... it does work well eventually.
865	112141	@Ddog10000 Because there is a *bat* coronavirus called BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/ that shares 96% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 across their entire genomes.So its got nothing to do with a vaccine construct. Stop looking for imaginary plots when the obvious is sitting right there
866	109691	Anyone want to bet that this will not last long and come March a 4th vaccine will be needed because ‚ÄúImmunity is Fading‚Äù?Pfizer will pay researchers to make something up no doubt and the world will believe them!#CovidVaccine

872	110525	I wish Good luck to @POTUS but I want to ask how would you distribute vaccines to other countries especially to dictators who think covid is not real
873	107918	@RenatusVoltaire @AlexBerenson @gummibear737 @EthicalSkeptic Which explains why we never get to ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù with the yearly influenza vaccines. Those shots, just like the ones for Covid-19 are meant to protect the recipient only.
874	108772	@njalexg @Jamie83851121 @Psygremlin @MeghanMcCain They are allowed to refuse the test and the vaccine.  Thousands of them already have.  It‚Äôs not hard to find articles on this.  Please don‚Äôt spread your ignorance.  It‚Äôs just as contagious, if not more so, than the coronavirus the illegal immigrants are carrying into the US.
875	112410	"Why would the article add ""rare"" to reaction?  How rare is it in comparison to the flu vaccine? Inquiring minds want to know..."
876	108989	It's almost like going out into the world without a vaccine was a terrible, dangerous idea. I hope Kyrie gets well.
877	202074	Thankful to receive my 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccine today. Bonus was being there at the same time as @Nicole4Raleigh!  Thanks to the team at @WakeMed for a seamless process.  #ralpol https://t.co/WFnFgbB336
878	110332	A good thread summarising the AZ vaccine trial in South Africa. Yes, it is not quite as effective, but it is still good.
879	110180	@Sapere_vivere this is not about all vaccines; this is specifically about the COVID-19 vaccine; even if they give away those patents they still make a lot of money -- when the whole planets has to be vaccinated the wallet is rather big
880	110769	So we accept that COVID-19 is not a one and done and now will invest in better detection, monitoring and presume vaccine distribution.This is what COMPETENT government looks like.
881	111707	Trump supporters won‚Äôt get the vaccine but because they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it but don‚Äôt hesitate to house 4 hotdogs for dinner.
882	109303	@ty_pharmer @Alec_Zeck so explain to me why are we signing wavers ? please tell me,show me proof why we need to sign a waver for the covid-19 shot with boosters if they are here to help us? Is it because once you sign that paper no one reliable other then your self ? Does common sense exist anymore ?
883	111821	Maybe @tedlieu will cover everyone‚Äôs 9 months of back rent with snarky tweets? Perhaps @RepSwalwell will chip in? After they get the vaccine of course, can‚Äôt have these American heros getting sick
884	108018	@CMOH_Alberta You are no doctor. You are sociopath if you think you are not abandoning Albertans with these changes. Our greatest fight against Covid-19 is the vaccine, you say. Yet, you don't give a sh!t about those who are unable to get vaccinated. RESIGN IMMEDIATELY!
885	110438	Not sure why we would give even a single vaccine to anyone not in the US while millions still require one. Of course other countries would want them for their people, but Americans come first. Especially as the government keeps people locked down in various areas.
886	109975	@KidsPlayPhotos @RandyRRQuaid I took the vaccine and it is real it's not Saline I had a very strong immune response my temperature was 102.4 my body swore up and down I had covid again it's a little discomfort but I've had covid-19 I never wanted again
887	109367	They all believe that other countries have been vaccinated.  They believe the vaccine is the only way out. Unfortunately this is just more inaccurate information.#COVID19
888	109183	So much good news in South Dakota re COVID-19 right now. Lots of numbers still high BUT: - Lowest # of active cases in 2 months- Hospitalizations lowest they've been in 2 months- death rate slowing down- Nearly all the Pfizer vaccine we've gotten so far has been administered
889	110158	@KatieDaviscourt @GovInslee You definitely can take vaccines, wear masks,  stay locked up, but don't make others do the same.  Vaccines do not work!Masks do not work!Staying locked up doesn't work! Just get Covid-19. And get over with it or stay locked up forever.  Covid-19 is not going anywhere.
890	110889	@uvmdanz @kylegriffin1 Transverse myelitis is common enough.  It's likely that they needed to confirm a secondary viral infection as its cause - one that wasn't a coronavirus or adenovirus as related to the vaccine. My father had TM. It's devastating, but not a reason to avoid this vaccine.
891	108248	@themadtaer There has never been a vaccine created for a coronavirus of any type.Due to antigenic shift they become useless in a short time.All viruses are not the same
892	108275	@nytimes The process of vaccine research and development is very long, and there are strict international standards. There are two possibilities. The first is to appease the public. The second is that the United States has already obtained the new coronavirus strain for research long ago.
893	108975	This tweet nicely catches the current widespread Covid-19 mood in Germany. ‚ÄòThe current situation is calling for old jokes made in the GDR. ‚ÄúSo you can‚Äôt get any vaccine here?‚Äù‚ÄúNo, sorry, but you get no vaccine over there. Here, you get no tests.‚Äù
894	111551	Reminds Me of d movie #2012 ..D highest bidders n d richest get to live ...Who decide that who would get d #CovidVic vaccine?? D ones with power n d moolah of course ..It sure is gonna get dirty  in d coming months...üòë#coronavirus
895	112405	@IvankaTrump 4/ June 16: ‚ÄúI always say, even without it [a vaccine], it goes away.‚Äù  June 18: ‚ÄúAnd it is dying out.

896	112665	The CDC is asking those unvaccinated for COVID-19 not to journey far from home this holiday weekend.And they will all honor this request, because  if you're too stupid to take the vaccine, of course you'll religiously observe pandemic travel restrictions.
897	112719	C'mon #Australia - do you really think a 3rd jab, after the first 2 failed to work, will be good for you? #AustraliaHasFallen
898	112631	@ajc Allow me to summarize before reading. There is a shortage so they‚Äôre opening up more vaccination centers because there is not enough vaccine to satisfy demand but they need to convince people to get it because too many people want it. Something about Choppin‚Äô.
899	109504	This pandemic will not be over until it‚Äôs over for everyone, everywhere. I‚Äôm calling on @Novavax to pledge their commitment to making sure the COVID-19 vaccine is distributed fairly and equitably around the world. #OneWorldProtected
900	112702	Olympics cancelled to comply with CoViD19 bio-security safety for whole world (air/sea travel+crowds).God has not protected even the most pure+good+religious believers/ humans from SARS so far!Until vaccine given to 80% every country/the world population - nobody is safe.
901	202142	Today is the 1st I will go out. Got the message to do the vaccine today, but need to reschedule in another 3 month since its just a month after detected covid19+.
902	108009	The only way we can get our lives back and be human again is for us all to get the vaccine-Don't listen to rumours listen to the NHS -there's no animal products or alcohol in it, there's no ingredients which suggest it causes infertility, it has been tested as it's a priority.
903	107748	So why I‚Äôm in @CVS 15600 old pike rd Maryland and they refuse to do walk-ins for the COVID-19 booster. They stated there is no manager in this store when I recorded the entire event
904	108745	Isn't this... socialized medicine? Govt will pick who gets vaccine soon. But please tell me how trump is somehow stopping communism.
905	111419	@SusanStJames3_ How do you think the globalists got a huge supply of miracle vaccines in short order. They money laundered through Afghanistan. Then they created a coronavirus pandemic. Our benefactors are psychopaths.
906	111274	Great to see that the vaccine is being rolled out! When will school staff get it though? ü§îü§îü§î #teachertwitter #vaccine #PGCE

1024	108585	The bar has been set #ROC! Just vaccinated a person who ran the race then came to get their vaccine. It‚Äôs just that easy to get the Covid19 vaccine.
1025	108073	@fishluvr1 @GavinNewsom Corona virus is transmitted more easily and attacks more severely than flu. Also, there is no vaccine for coronavirus like there is for various strains of flu each year. So, they really aren‚Äôt comparable.
1026	112708	I want someone, Anyone to explain to me how a mayor has the power to do this. No vaccine. No business. New laws because I say so. @NYGovCuomo u woulda looked like a Champ removing those moron but he must have something on U. That‚Äôs y his wife lost 850 million &amp; u say nothing.
1027	107814	"Mark Meadows has made it very clear that the only ""strategy"" they have for COVID-19 is to pray for a vaccine. They've given up trying to contain or mitigate the virus. This is made clear through the actions of Trump and Pence. They don't give a shit about you."

1030	110960	@HillBeverlyhill So a new conspiracy theory, Putin developed the coronavirus and has the vaccine to control the world
1031	112492	What's crazy is.. if covid only lasts 2weeks and we ALL keep ourselves clear for two weeks and the infected do not get a chance to mix with the healthy surely it wouldn't exist anymore? #COVID„Éº19 #COVID19 #CovidUK #CoronaVaccine
1032	109270	You have to be joking. Did you see what DeSantis did yesterday? He made an appearance @ a 'church' where members believe CoVid isn't real, and no one should get a Vaccine! DeSantis is DeDevil!
1033	108802	THE ONLY WAY OUT OF COVID IS VACCINATING YOURSELF!!!! If you hate being in a limbo between normality and lockdown, then go get that jab!!! #COVID19Vaccination
1034	111644	@truly_wild Yh that‚Äôs normal for most vaccines, they usually take over a year to make, however I meant that there‚Äôs no hope in a vaccine if our body doesn‚Äôt create antibodies against covid19 lmao bc that‚Äôs exactly what a vaccine is
1035	202286	MORE: This means, if you‚Äôve not received your first dose of the #COVID19 #vaccine, and you have tix to the Sept. 26 game against the WFT, you cannot attend.
1036	110728	I've been waiting for this day since March 2020. Having my entire family get sick with the virus was scarier than I imagined it would be, and the vaccine for the kids helps to ensure that we can avoid it happening again.
1037	110603	But it‚Äôs not pointing a gun in someone‚Äôs face to put a gun I their face and make them take medicine?Also, please learn science. If you‚Äôre vaxxed, they aren‚Äôt a threat to you.
1038	109558	6/ If effective vaccines *don't* roll out within the next 12 months, then countries will get fierce about +/- COVID_19 status; the divide will become very rigid. Don't kid yourself that everyone will be in the same boat; they're not and they won't be.https://t.co/1fXVcis22u
1039	111713	@LisaMarieBoothe I think he plans to make bank on vaccines and he does not have good intentions.Why would he send money to China to create a genetically modified strain of coronavirus (which infected the world) when our country put a stop to it? He predicted it - and he made it happen. #Evil

1041	202437	Oh goodness sake, stop making a celebrity moment out of the jab. It‚Äôs nothing but PR stunt after PR stunt. It‚Äôs tiresome to see and I‚Äôm sure the last round started impacting on people‚Äôs behaviour. Almost like ‚Äòwe‚Äôve got a vaccine let‚Äôs party‚Äô...
1042	111213	@JohnTitor33621 @realDonaldTrump OMG this is awful! Never wanted a coronavirus vaccine. Nothing from Fauci/Gates
1043	109931	How odd that China and other countries didn't require a filthy vaccine for the virus to go away.  Why does the U.S?  Oh, that's right, we are the only country that CANNOT sue them for any death or injury as they are ALL for profit! Got it!
1044	109802	This is what we call a progressive move. And a progressive initiative. Mana ada PN jaga rakyat? Mana? @Khairykj pun kata menurut artikel berita vaccine percuma untuk 7 juta orang. How about the rest? This is why @pakatanharapan_ is better for the people. @rajiv4malaysia Thanks
1045	201968	Lucknow: At least 28,331 people took the jab against Covid-19 in Lucknow on Wednesday. While 22,540 people took the second dose, 5,791 got the first. Among those vaccinated with first or second shots, 56% were men and 44% women.
1046	109930	I got vaccinated to protect my patients, my coworkers, husband, my family, my friends and myself. Vaccines work. But they work best when we all get them. #VaccinesWork #igottheshot #COVID19
1047	109348	They only care bout the money , you get the vaccine they get paid, you dont get it they fine you or jail you and they still getting paid
1048	112804	so, if its autumn before 'everyone' (who wants it) in all the groups is vaccinated, and the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission.. are we staying in this limbo life until autumn?
1049	108459	If you‚Äôre playing antivaxxer bingo:*vaccine is about control*no one has died from COVID-19*my friend had the vaccine and is now very poorly*perhaps alcohol mixes with the vaccine and makes it worse*government is trying to suppress our immune systems*masks are bad for you
1050	202359	Just had my second Covid-19 vaccine dose. Very grateful to the @nhscroydon_ staff, vaccine centre volunteers and @stjohnambulance volunteer at the site - all done efficiently and with a smile at the walk-in clinic in central #Croydon

1053	110101	@Jarin50926789 @sputnikvaccine In several countries. I have my first shot of Sputnik-V in Argentina on April, like millions everywhere, I had Covid-19 in May, in a very mild way
1054	109469	They are never going to stop this. We have to stand up to these satanic one world order oligarchs. They want us dead. Purpose of this is ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù which they call an ‚ÄúOperating System.‚Äù
1055	111759	Drop in vaccine clinics are great but where is the opportunity for the youth who have worked throughout the pandemic in shops and hospitality while not being able to go to campus? Why do we get blamed but be the last to be offered the vaccine when we‚Äôre in the worst environments?

1060	110848	@carry_studios @TakethatCt @robinmonotti @InCytometry Only some viruses. And only in retroviruses can this reverse transcribe and insert into our DNA. Coronavirus clearly does not have this capability and the vaccine certainly doesn't
1061	202237	Got my Covid-19 booster at Walmart. Them proceeded to spend too much money because I was shopping hungry and without a list. üòêMy super powers have yet to reveal themselves.
1062	108237	This is the thing I want to scream in the faces of everybody going on about opening up the lock down or letting a certain segment of the population out: You do not actually have any control over how this thing develops, till there is a viable vaccine.

1065	110579	So you're going to talk about mis-managing, huh? I think you need to reflect on yourself, Mr. President. Now is not the time for pettiness &amp; with-holding funding from an org which is distributing test kits &amp; trying to develop a vaccine. WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC. Act like an adult.
1066	110506	His tweet mocking the vaccine went viral with anti-vaxxers, then he died because he didn't get the vaccine. That should be an example to anti-vaxxers, and everyone not getting the vaccine honestly.
1067	111058	We won‚Äôt be taking evil Gates vaccine. Not met one person who will take this, not one and trust me I ask everyone wherever I go.
1068	110445	A reminder that it's very likely multiple promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates will not succeed. But also thisüëáis good news to see even with trials moving so quickly protocols working. Pauses are normal, this is scientists working to keep us safe.
1069	110474	This is what I was able to get. Almost no reaction to either shot. Waiting for a booster. I've read it's good to get one about 8 months after the last?
1070	110124	@CapsNats822 I worked the H1N1 pandemic. We got the first vaccines out by October. And that‚Äôs with a virus we know and can develop vaccines quickly...it takes months but that‚Äôs quick.

1077	107783	#CNNTownHall How is covid19 being handled in the world's poorer countries, such as Nigeria, the DRC, Indonesia and - especially - India (where the numbers appear terrifying in what they DON'T show)? How do we plan to help these countries if a vaccine is found?
1078	109744	And if there isn‚Äôt a vaccine (which is very likely)... what a ridiculous idea. And pay for it how? And frankly, I don‚Äôt want to stay home; I like living, not hibernating.

1171	109823	@bopinion Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

1178	109738	Before this covid-19 virus is over if it ever is we will see one million plus deaths in our country! We don't know enough about the vaccines ! How long will they last? Will they work against these new strains of coronavirus? We still have a lot to learn and deaths to come!

1184	109374	@pfizer @BioNTech_Group They‚Äôve been working on the flu vaccine for 60 years and it‚Äôs only 20-60% effective, but somehow they‚Äôve developed a COVID-19 vaccine that‚Äôs 95% effective in just a few months.

1197	110518	Great news. Is this a mutated strain, or just a different one, or is it near its end of life? There is no guarantee that there isn't stronger one lurking out there. How can a vaccine be developed if there are different versions floating out there.

1209	108514	@peszeke There is no biological imperative for the virus to only mutate to milder strains. As long as humans do such a good job of passing this thing around, coronavirus doesn‚Äôt have to worry about keeping its hosts upright. That‚Äôs why NPI are just as urgent as vaccines right now.

1253	108206	Scientists have identified an ‚Äúescape mutant‚Äù that may decrease the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines.The mutation -- called E484K -- has been found in a variant of the coronavirus first spotted in South Africa two months ago. That variant has now spread to 12 other countries.

1256	109417	@610CKTB ‚ÄúDoctors are worried that coronavirus may end up being like influenza, which requires a new vaccine every year both because the circulating strains mutate fast and because immunity from the vaccine wears off quickly.‚Äù

1258	202115	I got the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday. Other than my arm being sore as hell and some fatigue, I feel great. Sharing here just in case someone is on the fence about getting it (which is completely reasonable) and has questions.

1263	110349	wait 4 years before they can go back to work and it's much more likely that people will develop the antibodies that will protect them from this Coronavirus long before a vaccine comes to market even if they do it in 18 months or less.
1264	201916	My mother received her first Covid-19 vaccination shot today. It was the Moderna vaccine. She was speaking in tongues and hissing like a gargoyle afterwards. but is otherwise fine.
1265	109577	Have I missed the part where they isolated the virus to begin with? I‚Äôm curious to understand how a vaccine could be created without isolating the virus first. Or is that not even necessary? If anyone understands this, please let us know.
1266	110605	Why? 1 person who is jabbed has caught covid and has mild symptoms.Explain how that justifies a pause.
1267	108618	@nypost Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
1268	112058	So you can publish the data on the isolated genome that is the root cause then?If you can do that then you don't need any man made jab but an actual vaccine containing dead cells...or don't you have any???
1269	108181	@PeterKolchinsky @CityJournal If you're a virologist, then please discuss ADE as it pertains to coronavirus, and what the implications are for success in making a vaccine for this virus.Noting that infection with coronavirus does not convey long-term immunity, of course...
1270	110807	For those on my TLFor those who are in the UK, take the oxford vaccine, asap For those who have already had the vaccine, remember to have 2nd inoculation.But importantly still social distance and take precautions once you have had the vaccine.#covid19
1271	110801	@fact_covid  This is great news but once the #Coronavirus vaccine starts being rolled out, how will we prove we've had it and therefore safe to travel? Will it be like Yellow Fever where you get a certificate of vaccination?
1272	112233	I have been waiting for months in Australia for my #covid19 vaccine while my American friend has already been fully vaccinated its really fucking infuriating being in the dark about what's going on and when I heard I am going to have to wait until September for the Pfizer vaccine

1274	112533	@glassforsenate False.  This is merely a statement from an outside organization, NOT a bill.  There is NO evidence that the state has any plans to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory.
1275	109204	This astonishes me. I have young freinds who have had Covid, even donating antibodies- there is no way they need a vaccine.
1276	111067	@joh_public @DangerousGlobe @ChrisWickNews @trixasis2 Brother.We have no cure for coronavirus. Not the common cold, not SARS MERS or influenza.This vaccine does not cure or eradicate a virus.For that reason alone, lockdowns, mandatory vax, is merely impeding on human rights.This isn't POLIO, a non mutagenic virus.

1278	107930	@IrenaArts No one is forced to take a vaccine. The numbers willing to accept the Covid-19 vaccines are probably high enough to achieve herd immunity so the population will be safe. The issue then is focusing on making individuals safe. If you accept the vaccine, you make yourself safe.
1279	110868	I'll be with you Bernie! I don't even have the bloody stupid app on my phone and that's how it's going to stay. Even if they issued a paper form of proof, it would go in the shredder.#NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere
1280	108519	"if the ""vaccines"" work then why to those with them worry about those who don't get the jab?  The vaccinated still get and spread covid-19 &amp; it is proven they actually carry a higher viral load then those who don't get the jab. somebody explain this to me please."
1281	109169	@KO_Officer @birdbraininves1 @frankmentalizm @mcuban There has never been an instance of vaccine effects after 2 months, in history, with any vaccine.This coronavirus is new, and has killed over 700,000 people.  But you stick with that narrative you're so married to.

1289	112834	I got my first dose of the Covid Vaccine üíâ. And I feel ok ( It depends on the days). I want to be able to see my grandparents and my high risk friends. Plz get the vaccine!! #GetVaccinated #COVID19
1290	112062	There will never be a vaccine for Covid-19 because flu virus mutate just like other flu viruses #CoronaBollocks  #gmb
1291	202101	Covid coming to an immune system near youI was vaccinated and contracted the virus. Felt sick for about 36 hours, also my father who is vaccinated also caught the virus. He too was fine within two days.Vaccine made the sickness minimal but everyone's gonna get itStay safe
1292	110549	I hate that he gets a vaccine before so many who need it but...this is necessary. Can't overstate the impact on voters, especially skeptics, who need to see elected officials taking the vaccine.

1294	109572	@nate0902 @PaulOCo94834963 @DirtyWater1242 @CodeRed6789 @JoeBiden Likewise I‚Äôve been vaccinated for influenza and COVID-19 and I‚Äôve had both of them in my lifetime. Why? I would have to assume, the vaccine didn‚Äôt work. With COVID my symptoms were mild but so were the unvaxed thanks to Omicron. The flu not so mild.
1295	202430	Very happy that my mother and grandmother are now eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. Now how do I get them to take it? üßê
1296	112942	Don't care which political party you support. But these innocent people just want to get a vaccine shot. They are suffering. No one talks about them. They traveled and got nothing. Everything is politics, even human lives.
1297	108332	@Craig_A_Spencer I do think that once the vaccine has reached a majority of the population, Covid-19 will be comparable to influenza in terms of lethality, but that‚Äôs still a long way off. I‚Äôm qualified for a schedule 1a vaccine, but NYC is so understocked, it‚Äôll take months for my inoculation.
1298	202089	@Politics_PR Question, does getting the vaccine stop people from being able to spread Covid-19?  My vaccinated daughter-in-law has Covid-19 right now along with my son &amp; grandbaby so if I come in contact with my daughter-in-law can she spread it to me since she's vaccinated?
1299	112215	The pandemic is not over. I've received one does of the Moderna vaccine, going for my second in two weeks. Mask up, keep it up, because this is happening in Canada and it can very easily happen here, if it hasn't already started.
1300	111137	There was an israelie study in September/October that showed booster immunity wanes after just 12 days. There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine and this one is no different.
1301	108668	So does this mean I am extra protected with natural immunity and the vaccine? Hope so. Really don‚Äôt want to experience it again üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1303	111745	@Jimcorrsays is exactly right here.The flu shot is a campaign to incite COVID symptoms, further perpetuate the lockdowns, continue the public fear, &amp; then offer their solution.Their vaccine.The question is why, why is it important to get the covid vaccine...
1304	112620	Bro I‚Äôm out here reading the vaccine module that they give you and shit says ‚ÄúThe vaccine is an unapproved vaccine that may prevent Covid-19 and it‚Äôs not FDA approved‚Äù üòê Why are we getting this shit then

1306	108797	@BreitbartNews There will be no vaccine for covid19, just like there is no vaccine for ebola, MERS, SARS or H1N1...
1307	109369	@RatatoskrUK @joncoopertweets I guess  I've got no reason  to be angry  either huh. My perfectly  healthy  daughter  bought into the fear that's been pushed and took the vax. Now she has serious liver issues  and is borderline  liver failure.  Why? COVID-19 Vaccine  Injury.  A life if misery awaits her.
1308	111445	@Reuters If they can develop vaccines for COVID-19 this fast, there is no excuse anymore as to why there are not vaccines for other diseases!

1310	111096	Just Say No For The COVID-19 Vaccine.Everyone Will Get Sick Regardless If You're Vaccinated Or Not, And Symptoms Will Not Be Any Worse If You're Not Vaccinated.
1311	112051	Now they are going after The Navy Seals over the Covid-19 vaccine. When are they gonna stop. I want to know who‚Äôs making these decisions Hunter   Because who ever it is they‚Äôve got to be high
1312	112855	If there was a vaccine for this coronavirus all this economic impact could be avoided. But you see vaccines are not money makers so they are not funded well.
1313	111938	Trumpets are really stupid. Instead of getting a free vaccine plus a vaccine card these idiots got no vaccine and paid $200 for a fake card.
1314	110892	@GovernorTomWolf Don't do it one covid-19 was just made up so you dummies out there who are still wearing masks could think that Trump was bad yes it's true the vaccine is to control you and it is also too poison you down the road I will not get the vaccine

1322	112696	Does Twitter even post people who make the remarks about the covid-19 if you're against the vaccine I think they can't kick it off I don't even think they would if you'd believe it talk about it if you're not pro-vaccination they don't even let your comments go on

1325	112895	@realDonaldTrump Not even close to accurate. The stock market is not the economy. There are still millions out of work and the Coronavirus is still a Pandemic. There is no vaccine and your political stunts won‚Äôt prove a vaccine‚Äôs efficacy.
1326	112034	Now I don‚Äôt work in branding/marketing as such, but Lordy: ‚ÄòPfizer‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine will now be known as ‚ÄúComirnaty,‚Äù Health Canada wrote. Moderna‚Äôs, meanwhile, has been dubbed ‚ÄúSpikevax‚Äù and AstraZeneca‚Äôs will be called ‚ÄúVaxzevria.‚Äù‚Äô
1327	110571	So, during the interval between the 2 shots for the vaccine - they‚Äôre advising to avoid consuming any alcohol until our immune system accepts &amp; gets used to itYeah...it‚Äôs going to be lockdown level 5 all over again if that‚Äôs the vaccine route in South Africa üò≠üòÇ
1328	111695	Got my first dose of Coronavirus COVID-19 Moderna vaccine. My arm is sore, I feel kind of dizzy or like I've been in ocean too long. Still no big deal. I think the virus is a joke but whatever, if it makes it easier on me and people will leave me alone, I'll get the vaccination.
1329	110129	Worth watching this 1 min video if you think that you will not be getting the Covid-19 vaccine.The question is why Gates does this. It isn‚Äôt for money. He is an ideologue and truly believes that he is doing something positive for the world: he also wants to reduce population
1330	112769	@___decipher___ @metamacky @savanna_jeffrey @BBCNews There is too much uncertainty surrounding this vaccine so I'm in no rush to take it. Need to take a step back and analyse before making the decision to take it or not. Coronavirus also doesn't seem as serious and deadly as previously thought either.
1331	110598	Ignorance is going to be the end of human existence. You want any sense of normal back in our lives, get the vaccine.
1332	109489	@rath_erin @chipcoffey *Diseases.  So what you're implying is that everyone that gets sick should just hope for the best that they don't end up dead instead of doing what they can to get better?  No wonder the US is where it is with COVID-19 with that thinking.  Vaccines Work.
1333	112754	The Modi government refused to do adequate pandemic planning--they had a year to do this.Misinformation has hurt people, too.Now, the need is supported shelter in place with food aid&amp; free vaccines for all. Although, vax weren't ordered, either.#COVIDSecondWave

1343	108008	Important. People can still harbour virus in their nose &amp; throat, so immunity doesn‚Äôt mean you cannot pass it on. May be an issue with vaccines. Only way to get out of that dilemma is Whole population vaccination with high uptake esp in vulnerable categories

1348	110887	Unfortunately people who are skeptical are still going to stay skeptical.  They will cling on to the other conspiracy theories as justification to not get it. They still are ignorant about how vaccines works.

1351	109795	I reviewed your article and find it is fundamentally flawed; i.e. there will never be a vaccine. There is no vaccine for any of the coronavirus as a class, including SARS, MERS, the Asian flu of 1957 or the Spanish flu of 1918. Basing financial decisions on bad science is dumb
1352	108974	@realDonaldTrump We don‚Äôt need an experimental vaccine for the Common Cold virus a Coronavirus. The media is preying on people‚Äôs ignorance by calling it a ‚ÄúNovel Coronavirus.‚Äù FYI: If vaccines are so safe, why aren‚Äôt vaccine manufacturers liable for vaccine injuries?

1354	108918	@LiesTbe @WendyBellPgh Polio also isn't completely eradicated globally either. Neither is the flu. Smallpox is the only disease completely prevented from vaccines.  The reason vaccines exist is to get to herd immunity without massive death. The flu and coronavirus are two completely different viruses

1369	112070	Like I said earlier... (TNXP) T-cell vaccine will bring back normal!!  Every human on earth already has there vaccine platform in their arm already and soon will have a cov19 one also
1370	110601	Good morning - As you may have heard, the first batch of the COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Los Angeles last night. This moment is a testament to the work of the scientists who made this possible, and to all those working logistics to get this vaccine to our frontline workers.
1371	111480	I‚Äôm not taking it. They can have my dose.I suggest the look into planned parenthood‚Äôs Margaret Sanger, Bill Gates Sr., Bill Gates before they take a vaccine. Personally I don‚Äôt want to play God.Some powerful people involved in vaccines, in their own words, do want to play God.
1372	112914	No ifs about it,  Would you take a punt on vaccine for a coronavirus that has been rushed through? The Molotov cocktail will be ready to go!!! Just the production to sort.Bill Gates is on record stating he wants population reduction. who does he think he is God?  @kbf
1373	108408	@OilersSpoilers @J_TheCynic Coronavirus is just a flu that‚Äôs a fact! Covid is different. Look it up. Fear of getting covid when you‚Äôve got coronavirus is the concern. Vaccines aren‚Äôt coming anytime soon. They never even made one for COVID SARS
1374	109792	West Point is in my community. I am already taking every precaution I possibly can, but this decision made more places unsafe for longer. I can't go back to my therapist's office until there's a vaccine.
1375	111217	It's gonna get real ugly soon.  We will not be taking a vaccine for a virus with an extremely high recovery rate and effective treatments.
1376	111807	@NHSEngland I'd like to sign up for under 18 covid19 vaccine trials in North of England please can you give me info. I've raised over ¬£2,000 with my painted pebbles for the NHS, am still going but also doing an outreach for the air ambulance having collected over 15,000 stamps.
1377	109080	The thing about anti vaxxers. They only hurt themselves and other antivaxxers, that is if the vaccine is effective. If, like the Flu Vaccines that have an efficacy rate of somewhere between 19 and 39% depending on the year, then even with the vaccine you can get COVID-19.
1378	108105	Should it be mandatory for healthcare workers to get the COVID-19 vaccine? What if they say no? We debate!
1379	110647	If the vaccine is deadly, why start the healthcare workers when they are the most needed resource? #healthcare #vaccine #COVID19 #CyrilRamaphosa #FamilyMeeting
1380	201975	Alhamdullah received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine today! I am ready to finally find some normalcy in a year that has been filled with uncertainty and chaos. üôè
1381	108317	When are people going to wake up and realise that this isn't about a deadly virus, it's about global control of the population. The vaccine itself is experimental (a trial) and we're the guinea-pigs. Bill Gates (Psychopath/Eugenicist) wants to cull the global population. Wake up.
1382	108174	"Totally serious question...Hypothetically, if 100% of the world got the COVID-19 injection, would the virus be eradicated?(As I understand it, the virus would just mutate seeing as the ""vaccines"" do not stop transmission. Am I wrong in my understanding?)"

1385	111811	@OneTrueShaun @AOC How would Medicare for all have prevented the Coronavirus pandemic or speeded up the vaccine process?
1386	111355	@beyerstein my prediction is that the road to a safe effective coronavirus vaccine is bumpy and the bumps in the road provide grist for the antivaxxers
1387	202405	@FTalleen @kgopinion My mother was born in the 3rd year of the Coronavirus pandemic called (falsely) Spanish Flu. She was 7 months old when her 24 yr old mother died of it.I am very grateful a vaccine has already appeared in the 1st yr of covid 19.It makes me patient for Aug
1388	110079	@GovAndyBeshear  @StevenStackMD  it the flu vaccine has not cured the flu then there is no vaccine that will cure c19.  Locking down will just kill us all.

1391	109941	If a vaccine is required for admittance to states/countries i need to travel to, or to attend events like concerts, then yes I'll get vaccinated. Otherwise no.
1392	201814	Yesterday, it was nice to have a safe visit with my parents after being vaccinated. Go get vaccinated asap! There is no excuse not to, as the COVID-19 vaccine is readily available. I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot &amp; went to work the same day. No side effects. Science works!
1393	110017	@EvaRuth @linlewi1 @RobertTGarrett @travisfortexas @stevefortx @KVUE Why won't they take a vaccine which has emergency use authorization to prevent getting #COVID19?Why do they want to take Regeneron which has emergency use authorization to react to getting COVID19?Are they paying the higher cost out of pocket? #ThoughtSo
1394	112892	Good ....I hope she got the vaccine that makes you sterile...cause this world doesn‚Äôt need her offspring
1395	108452	@thehill Sure you will deliver a vaccine this year for the Coronavirus for the politicians and the Rick
1396	111731	After what happened with my annual flu jab this year - I'm sorry, but I don't have confidence in the Government or NHS to administer the Covid-19 vaccine on time, consistently and with the right priorities.Hopefully I'm wrong. Many people will be ok. But it's like a lottery
1397	202149	Hey @BillGates. Just to let you know, I‚Äôm having a Chicken and Leek Pie tonight and neither you or the vaccine I had this morning had any say on my decision making whatsoever. My main influence was that it was reduced in @marksandspencer... #CovidVaccine #COVID19
1398	109955	To anyone still dithering about whether or not to have the #COVID19 #vaccine, see below. I've come an awfully long way from initial scepticism and optimism when the pandemic first broke. Thought it would fizzle  quickly and vaccines wouldn't be needed. Boy, did I get it wrong!
1399	112762	people are complaining that a coronavirus vaccine ‚Äòhasn‚Äôt been tested for long enough‚Äô like there isn‚Äôt a new flu strain and vaccine produced each year that they will happily get
1400	110373	@SharylAttkisson If the COVID-19 vaccines work, then the vaccinated should be protected from the rest of us. If the vaccinated still contract the virus or any variant, then the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work, so why do they insist that we take it?
1401	110926	So the vaccine is good for 6 months,  AFTER 2 DOSES...so where does that put Canada? Since it could be 6 months to just, maybe get a second dose...#TrudeauFailedCanada #RemoveThePM
1402	108870	@JoelEdw85182292 @pitblackthorn @JAsakiewicz @disillusionedx @MsBlaireWhite Covid-19 already has some variations which makes the prospect of a potential vaccine more.. Complicated. Hopefully something gets figured out here soon though for I am just not sure if my sanity will hold up.
1403	108485	@AndrewBrandt True, but it also shows their ignorance of how the MRNA vaccines work...per their own inserts they do not prevent the transmission of #COVID19. They only work as an RRR not an ARR vaccine  which means they may reduce 1 or more symptoms when you get it.
1404	108657	"@JamarlinMartin Trump-lovers won't get the coronavirus vaccine because they ""don't know what's in it"" but will be first in line to get a McRib."
1405	111229	This guy is gonna make a trillion dollars off this vaccine and is definitely paying media to keep the fear mongering going until every one receives it
1406	108810	@Frances_Coppola You don't really need to take vaccines. A virus is dangerous only if you allow it to be. You just need to wear mask and follow the hygiene strictly (not because the Covid-19 is dangerous, but because you do not want to get infected)
1407	112789	If the coronavirus vaccine has nanites in it I'd like to volunteer to try it, I'm curious what the mind control aspect feels like.
1408	111218	Why are people in such an unseemly hurry to start dining out and drinking in closed bars and restaurants? The virus is not on a holiday. It may be wafting towards you from the,next table of laughing, chatting youngsters. Wait for the vaccine #covid19 #stayhome
1409	111570	Like a 7.. don‚Äôt know how life will ever go back to normal before a vaccine. I may be young but I have asthma and have had bouts of bronchitis. Worried about my mom and grandma.. the fact that you can be asymptomatic is just ü§Ø. Also read that it‚Äôs causing miscarriages sooo. 7.
1410	109922	@PointCounterpt @marsha_vivinate I have a lot of symptoms of COVID-19 so going to take a test before I get the vaccine just to be safe. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs COVID. I think I just never got rid f my bronchitis.
1411	112263	Getting ready to delegate all my COVID-19 masks to an huge bonfire. Get the vaccine, and let's bring good times back by tossing all the f--king idiots that want to still wear these disguises to manipulate the rest of us in an huge dumpster with the rest of the trash!
1412	109058	We need a global #vaccination effort or the pandemic will never end, and with new mutations of #Covid all it takes is for 1 variant to become resistant to vaccines and treatments to keep the virus a constant threat to all the people in the world.
1413	111245	Coronavirus is fucking up the entire world, but some how niggas think the vaccine is a conspiracy to take them out? Lmaoooo
1414	109223	@nytimes If the study that states after getting the coronavirus you have immunity for only 3 months, wouldn‚Äôt a vaccine also protect you for only 3 months?
1415	111008	@Chriswb71 @elle91 I don't care either way because if no vaccine is found what then occurs?Death rate of regular Flu goes down and Covid19 stays on actuarial charts which will go down as well but not enough to equal. It burns itself out and pops up occasionally.Like H1N1.
1416	110566	Isnt that illegal?If not,WHY?WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC FOR PETE'S SAKE! I WANT THINGS AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE..this is why things can't get better, people like that! The hypocrites are getting the vaccine on the low low or in their back yards but telling the uninformed don't get it! Ughh
1417	110448	@Cast45J Oh good grief. There‚Äôs no vaccine for coronavirus, have you not been paying attention? So being ‚Äúunvaccinated‚Äù (or frankly an illegal alien) has nothing to do with anything.

1422	108762	@onekade The coronavirus vaccine likewise is designed to protect the vaccinated person from the coronavirus to a certain degree, in the event that the person catches the coronavirus. This is why emphasizing the protective qualities of vaccines is so important.

1426	110227	@BillBlair @JustinTrudeau @MBGov @redcrosscanada We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.

1430	202444	"Not only did this information circulate MONTHS before vaccines were be distributed, but the pharmacist that gave me my first dose told me exactly this. ""Flu like"" symptoms are expected after your second dose. This is insignificant compared to actual COVID19 symptoms."

1436	112536	@SkyNews Correction: virtually everyone is going to get coronavirus, regardless of age or vaccination status. Whitty has already said this. It is now endemic and we'll all catch it if we haven't already - vaccines mitigate symptoms, but don't stop spread. It's not just about children
1437	111270	My favorite part about @trading212 is that when important events happen such as a Coronavirus vaccine being found, their platform and servers completely freeze and you can't buy or sell anything. I absolutely love it, would recommend to anyone.

1443	110195	Even if this can be resolved, how many people will refuse to take the #COVID19vaccine (if one is actually found and approved) thus rendering it useless? And they will be right not to take it given the risks of #COVID19 to anyone under 70 is near 0.00%.

1480	111642	Exactly like any other virus(colds and flu)...they run their course because there has never been a vaccine and there will not be in the future! Totally about social engineering to remake the globe!
1481	107759	If this isn‚Äôt happening where you are, it can.  They didn‚Äôt think it would happen there either.  If we all just trusted this article and these people, and stayed home for 6 weeks, until that vaccine. This story wouldn‚Äôt happen anywhere.  Please. https://t.co/pnTOcECTbP

1490	111880	I can't see the gains for an esteemed doc to come out so hard against the #covid19 vaccine. It's not like it's going to get him more than headache and heartache. I'll pass on the poke thx.
1491	111427	@drjfrank @kevinpurcell Which is closer to #covid19, SARS or measles? Being a learned PHD, tell me why there isn't a SARS vaccine after all these years.   In the meantime, what about IV vitamin C, liposomal vitamin C, or chaga mushrooms? Are you only interested in things you can patent?
1492	112395	@V_4_Vendatta Sadly this is true. We see the vaccine injured patients in the hospitals everyday. The ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù for covid19 is absolutely going to be a lethal injection to the immune system.
1493	110952	@shaunsi57094640 @eNCA @TheRealClementM The vaccination we took made us to be 100% immune. But covid-19 vaccines do not give us immunity. Actually keeping my mask on and taking necessary vitamins and minerals provides me with more prevention than vaccination. In about 6 months these vaccines will need some boots. üíâüíâ
1494	112001	Good news for once: 17 March 00:30 GMT ‚Äî First vaccine clinical trials begin in the United States. The first phase I clinical trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine has begun in Seattle, Washington.
1495	110604	This is really the good news that we've all been waiting for re the vaccine. Not only will we be better protected, but there's less risk we'll be harming others.
1496	112670	So, 6% of the US has contracted covid-19 so far.On those figures they'll reach herd immunity at between 3.5M to 4.6M death. How much they can cut this figure all depends on how fast the vaccine roll outs go. Scary.

1499	110881	@GameSetMatch000 @shaw_2_raw @imdaniel00 But for the flu jab, they are guessing. They have to predict mutations/strains. With coronavirus, we literally know the exact virus. There's no excuse for such a low effective rate when you have all the info.

1505	109919	my fam is now currently in its second covid-19 breakout since the pandemic started... the first time was because there were no vaccines out... this time it‚Äôs because my brother decided he was immune and didn‚Äôt need the vaccine... he just scheduled his first dose

What is going on in the world?
1508	112700	@GovLarryHogan @MdPublicSchools - A March 1st reopening goal is not realistic. We need to have all teachers and staff get a second dose of the vaccine and two weeks to develop immunity. There just aren't enough vaccines yet.

1520	109481	There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Wash hand frequently with sanitizers. #FightCovid19
1521	108040	We tolerate mediocrity. If other countries would like to have world class vaccines with efficacy rate of 95 % ( Pfizer and Moderna )  , then we set up ourselves to have mediocre immune response. Still, 50 percent sounds like a far cry from 95 percent.
1522	111196	@RexKwasiDanquah Covid19 vaccine is not even a vaccine,the yellow fever has stood the test of time, there's adequate research on the effects and also it has proven to be effective on like the virus which had not yet been fully understood, don't compare the two
1523	202258	Yes it is a great achievement and I am pleased that I had my first jab today. All we need now is good leadership to make sure we exit lockdown following the science and data and don‚Äôt let the virus get a grip and chance to mutate.

1529	111515	This is the only sensible choice, otherwise we'll continue to get small pockets of outbreaks indefinitely until we get a vaccine. If we get a vaccine
1530	111190	@CurlyDreads I also personally don‚Äôt get the flu vaccine however coronavirus is much more serious than the flu in that it can have long term health effects. I would never want to be the guy who gets it and is fine but passes it on to another young healthy person who then develops lung issues.

1713	110482	Australia have bossed the pandemic response so far, but they do seem to be dithering a bit over the vaccine roll out - would this be fair, Aussie tweeps?
1714	112080	@davidkurten An employer terminating an employee who cites a valid reason for refusing to get a COVID-19 vaccine can amount to a human rights violation. The workplace must also not be discriminatory towards employees who do not receive the vaccine for religious or medical reasons.

1717	110273	@FelixHofe I think there‚Äôs a false premise that if crowds are allowed to attend games, then they will automatically come. It‚Äôs going to take some time for confidence in public venues as safe spaces to return. I personally wouldn‚Äôt attend a large sporting event absent a covid-19 vaccine
1718	111142	The vaccine is poison. Please tell people not to get it if and when they say it's ready. They already have it. It is meant to destroy the human race for the NWO.
1719	112583	@Variety Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

1720	110930	I don't have a problem with people who don't want the vaccine, because my vaccine (unlike my mask) will actually protect me from #COVID19. Unfortunately I don't have a vaccine yet. So please wear a mask.When possible just stay home.#COVIDzero

1723	107887	@a58diamonds There is truth in what you say but a vaccine is a long way away if they don't lockdown we are going to see many folk Die. Covid19 is real its killing our family members folk need to take Covid19 serious as it's not going away. I agree it suits the Tories they want the folk to die
1724	109546	@INArteCarloDoss that‚Äôs why the FDA in the US has not fully approved the covid19 vaccines. they are leaving themselves an out hahaha.

1727	108431	It‚Äôs great that discussion of easing COVID-19 restrictions starts. Only Few people can get the vaccine in my country.  It has is so long distance to ease the restriction.
1728	111426	@SenKamalaHarris No no. I wouldn‚Äôtrust  him. Let trump and wh test it out. ... and u know,since trump crazy ,no mask wearing base,thinks this is a hoax. Why would they take a vaccine? This virus will be here forever. Or until trumps base all dies fm coronavirus. They will think vaccine is a hoax
1729	108544	@jimcramer Suppose we had a vaccine tomorrow for the coronavirus. How many people would get the shot. I believe it would be similar to the flu shot. Many people will not get it because they believe it causes them to get the flu.  Military no choice, you get the shot.
1730	110331	Why are doctors testing vaccines that are already tested???Or ko Soweto they are making their own vaccines?
1731	112127	I‚Äôm just going to be a broken record on this: we owe it to children for teachers, school staff and childcare provides to be prioritized for the #COVID19 #vaccines. We have done so little for kids during this pandemic and we can‚Äôt keep ignoring their suffering. #openschools #COVID
1732	110010	@carlosex I am not sure Fauci is right.  For an 80-yr old male, the #COVID19 CFR is 15% before the vaccine; after the vaccine, it is still 0.75% for a 95% effective vaccine - safer but not zero.
1733	111648	@VikiLovesFACS I'm curious if anyone sees changes after a COVID19 infection. If there is a correlation with the vaccine it would be good to know if the infection has the same finding.
1734	111996	The only 100% guaranteed vaccine for the Coronavirus is the November election. Five minutes after Trump is reelected the Covid-19 will totally disappear.

1750	112175	It doesn‚Äôt matter to the Trump administration if you die before you get the coronavirus vaccine what matters is that they make profits for one of their campaign donors. We need to know what other vaccine candidates this admin supposedly has and who they are connected to.
1751	110231	@LubaK19260165 @ShaneCoombs @JoeSilverman7 There‚Äôs never before been a vaccine for a coronavirus for humans. And in animals they have actually caused more problems than they solve.

1755	108616	FAUCI: He's cautiously optimistic about a covid-19 vaccine because studies so far show that the body does mount an immune response both to the virus itself, and to vaccines in early trials. That response doesn't happen with HIV. So a covid-19 vaccine is much easier to make.
1756	111989	please remember that the vaccine does not prevent us from contracting COVID-19 (we are examples), we can still get it if we are not careful. So, I request those of you who have got the vaccine, to continue to take care as before (wearing mask, social distancing etc).

1771	110943	@SizweLo There was never will be successful vaccines for coronavirus.... It failed before and it will fail this time...... The previous attempt on SARS and MERS also caused death in animals and neurological problems in humans.....
1772	111779	How can you possibly say this with confidence when the science doesn‚Äôt exist yet?! There have been no long-term studies on what this jab will do to women trying to conceive, pregnant women, and newborn babies because NOT ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED in order to complete such studies.
1773	110105	One thing I'm curious about--COVID is not the only coronavirus with a spike protein. I'm genuinely curious as to whether or not the vaccine may inadvertently protect against other coronaviruses as well.Like the common cold, for instance.
1774	108937	@ventingmyangar Andrew, allow me to share some facts with you. THERE IS NO VACCINE THAT PREVENTS COVID19. Vaccinated can still get, spread, and die from the virus. Goal of the vaccine is to lessen the symptoms should you get it. So what good is a #VaccinePassport if we all can spread the virus.
1775	110782	We‚Äôre in Tooth Fairy territory here.‚Ä¢ We know you‚Äôve already had Covid19, so severe that you ended up in ICU.‚Ä¢ We know you‚Äôve had two vaccines.‚Ä¢ The idea that you don‚Äôt have antibodies is absurd.Stop talking to us like small children!
1776	112891	@terryodance @danwootton I know this too Terry...and don‚Äôt you think if scientists had found a vaccine with longevity that the  world would take the same action to kill it off..it has been amazing that they have a vaccine for Covid-19 so quickly....

1789	110121	@BetteMidler First, hardly anyone is allergic to peanuts so they should eat their own food, not penalize everyone else. Second, coronavirus is not deadly but the vaccines are, you don't want to be pushing those. And last but not least, you're a crazy old bat who's had her day. You may go now.
1790	108968	Imo this whole coronavirus deal has been a government plan for a long time in order for Marshall law, they will come up w a mandated vaccine which will have trackers/chips in them that we will w no choice HAVE to take. We will run out of supplies &amp; THEY will supply us w wtf knows
1791	109981	If the common cold is in the coronavirus family of viruses, then is it reasonable to conclude no vaccine will be created for Covid-19?
1792	108201	@Mac_D33 @KayMachitje @rramagwa You all seem to be forgetting that grade 1s will need somewhere to go. You also seem to be forgetting that the coronavirus is going nowhere until a vaccine is developed and rolled out. But good luck with those plans.
1793	108849	@tablefloor @News24 Makes no mudaphucking sense. When  these vaccines were introduced, they said they were going to PROTECT people from catching and spreading Covid19.

1811	107689	To whom it may concern, I get two to three flu shots a year. I choose not get covid19 vaccines due to religious beliefs as  a anabaptist. I don't own a TV in my house. It is my choice as a person not get a vaccine.

1820	110456	@Meggone2 @LJayMax @Paramythia__ I think the bio-weapon is the vaccine not the Coronavirus2019 so the elites will know not to get the vaccine. I think covid-19 is just a flu because we have a different flu every year.
1821	108916	@Timcast What is skeptical is this doctor apparently doesn't know that if someone has COVID-19 infection already that injecting them with a vaccine wouldn't do anything since they already are producing the antibodies.
1822	111528	If one chooses not to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to misinformation, but is the first in-line to get an anti-body infusion once they catch COVID-19... then how does that line-up and make sense? #Reflections
1823	202128	Alhamdulillah that Allah SWT still let me live. I'm #covidvariantdeltasurivivor I wait for October to get my first #COVID19 #CovidVaccine Thank you for all my families and friends support while I in the hospital. Thank you for all doctors and nurses whom are taking care of me GBU https://t.co/LrOClUdMKx
1824	202396	As of Monday, 568,328 individuals had received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 143,638 have been fully vaccinated.
1825	111163	A personal bright spot in a weird and disheartening week: My parents each got their first #COVID19 vaccine today! I won't say my home state is handling the rollout well but I will say my years of trying to get concert tickets before they sold out was put to use for a great cause!
1826	108395	Usual clinical path of vaccine development is 5-7 years, and yet here‚Äôs the sociopath @MattHancock  betting big on a vaccine, that has been conjured up in 9 mths. Not only has this crook played out a PCR test fraud on all of us, he now wants to clean up, with a vaccine fraud..
1827	111438	Welp the numbers are going back up, there isn‚Äôt a vaccine for kids under 12, and our governor said masking can‚Äôt be made mandatory. So, it looks like we are homeschooling for a second year. We are planning our curriculum &amp; about to head to the library for inspiration. ü§ûüèª#COVID19
1828	109328	Three Covid-19 vaccine prototypes developed with pilot test results expected in June in Russia.  Hopefully the world is going to converge on a successful one in the very near future.
1829	112004	I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm confused, how do you engage in illegal surveillance of me and frame it as COVID-19 contact tracing while demanding I give you my blood for a vaccine, please explain @migov @MayorMikeDuggan It makes no sense. @Ford @Harvard @SCOTUSblog @scotusreporter @IsraeliPM
1830	108147	@FlatFeminist OK DEAR ANTI VACCINE THIS IS OUR WORLD RIGHT NOW WITH OUT A VACCINE FOR THE CORONAVIRUS STOP THIS FUCKING BULL SHIT
1831	202079	Got my booster last weekend. Glad to have this service provided and the extra protection against the #DeltaVariant
1832	109490	@windycityrebel4 @BillShaikin No Fauci at the next press conference is gonna be like ‚ÄúThe coronavirus vaccine will not come out until 2099, until then everyone stay inside your house‚Äùü§£
1833	109483	Don't be surprised if everyone on the planet tests positive for Covid-19This is how they are going to force you to take the vaccine.Mark my words folks.DO NOT TAKE IT!!!
1834	108716	I won't deny the clear reduction in deaths and symptoms that the vaccine has achieved. But there are serious questions about how it has been unequally rolled out - why it wasn't made open source - as it could have been - to battle a global threat. #rentiercapitalism
1835	109758	I‚Äôm all for motivation but what about everyone who called phone lines religiously multiple times everyday, waited in long lines, kept tabs on extra shots, and stayed home until they could get their vaccine? #wewantrewardstoo #niceguysfinishlast
1836	108533	Very glad to hear my friend @Pres_Sandoval is only experiencing mild symptoms. Like he said, COVID-19 vaccines are doing their job, and I hope he has a quick recovery.
1837	111396	@BNODesk We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Please help!
1838	112795	Pfizer characterized the best vaccine because it came from trump and Merkel that's why has 3 doses they put cancer in out and in again but Johnson puted in and puted out in only one vaccine the other vaccines are just for a normal sickness like COVID-19
1839	108023	@rjgoo Everyone will probably get the virus eventually anyways ... might as well pull the bandaids off and let it go through the population. There is NO guarantee of a vaccine as there has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus style sickness.
1840	109997	@ukiswitheu @jwahjwah Sadly, getting the vaccine as @sajidjavid has proved, isn't the panacea they made it out to be, initially, that's another fabrication of the truth. And #Covid19 isn't like the flu, it's much worse, yet another fabrication. The truth is we don't really know the facts.
1841	109164	Or, and bear with me here, just get a real vaccine card.  FOR FREE.  All it takes is one (or two) little shot(s).
1842	109077	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
1843	110522	@POTUS ... please deliver a fireside chat on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Explain how there was no plan and how your administration is going to right the ship. I think we need the truth and we need assurance that you're on this until we're all safe.
1844	109482	Going to have COVID-19 Vaccine tomorrow. I am nervous,not about the effects that have it. It's about my order is at 7-11 now and I can't even take the order because I don't have Cram School tomorrow
1845	108625	Indian vaccine is sold in Lahore Hyderabad (Sind)!Karachi for exhorbitant price go and get it if you aukaat. Your country doesn't have aukaat
1846	112612	So I went ahead and took a test for Covid19 immunity.Turns out I was negative, so now I have to keep wearing a mask until there is a vaccine.Dammit!
1847	201913	@BabyMeriel Yes, I do take ImmunPro most especially during the early part of the Covid-19 wave. I think, I need to buy again as my arm got a 1-week bruise gawa ng Janssen J&amp;J vaccine. Thanks for reminding me, I'll also take my vitamins regularly ulit.
1848	111018	Did you give your child a choice on a vaccine? Makes me wonder if you‚Äôll actually put your own kids in the same spot as every other kid.My son had Zero choiceI‚Äôd rather him have #Covaxin Too bad tax paying American!@US_FDA you don‚Äôt have a choice
1849	108979	How are hospitalization rates increasing? Intensive care rates, death rates increasing, on breakthrough infections. ON THE SAME VARIANT?????????? How do vaccines work again?Am i the only one seeing this?
1850	108382	I guess we'll see another variant enter the stage in 2022 and we can only hope that the vaccines or antibodies after an infection will be able to cope with that one, while COVID-19 will slowly become an endemic disease.
1851	112732	Lots of opinions about the #CovidVaccine going around #good and #bad so will you be having the #COVIDVaccination yes? no? and why? #COVID19 #Covid19UK #COVIDSecondWave #coronavirus #Poll #BuildBackBetter #antivax #fakenews #VaccinationDrive #sheep #SheepNoMore #NoVaccine #us #uk
1852	110766	I'm not worried about that vaccine or COVID-19 anymore. IF COVID-19 is my ticket up out of here, then so be it I'll take it. I'm not afraid 2 give up this world or this flesh suit. I've been dead b4 &amp; I'm ok with that i really am. When it's ur time it's just that.ur time.
1853	111844	@TeamYouTube I got the email, i removed the video they say i cant appeal it since i removed it, but due to being a federal contractor i had to get the jab, so i shared my experience in getting it, i didnt give out misinformation about Covid19 as it suggests i did.

1859	109722	Hi @denmarkdotdk! Please help me! What's latest good news about Covid19/Coronavirus vaccines &amp; treatments? Are you well connected with other countries? If so, may you please help us in US who wanna work, but can't because we're seen as inferior &amp; about to be enslaved? Please?
1860	111771	People of Lahore, don't forget it.. When coronavirus was only in China this govt forbid our own children to bring them back in Pakistan. Zulfi Bukhari let pass coronavirus patients - so we got coronavirus. This govt has gifted u this. Ye hamaray Punjab ko bura kahenge...
1861	110402	@therecount No-one knows how immunity to covid-19 persists in the body because we've only known about the existence of the virus for 2 years, and we've only had vaccines for 1 year. It may be we need 3 shots, like polio or HPV, or we may need period boosters, like tetanus.
1862	111919	@JeremyVineOn5 @jemmaforte @adepstein1 @theJeremyVine @StormHuntley @MattHancock Schools shouldn't be re-opened until we've got a vaccine or have worked out how to do social-distancing with groups of kids.If we can't do that, then we're putting all teachers and parents at risk and so it follows the rest of us.#JeremyVine #Coronavirus #Covid19
1863	111662	@realDonaldTrump Sad ! Should kids go back to school before we get a vaccine for this virus? I don‚Äôt think so.
1864	111420	@realDonaldTrump You not only tolerate it, u foment it! Forcing states to open up schools &amp; churches, with no coronavirus vaccine is structural violence. Not every body could afford the million dollar Regeneron cocktail they gave u. Plus u‚Äôre trying to take away ppl‚Äôs insurance amidst a pandemic!
1865	108880	Yeah I‚Äôm done being nice, if you don‚Äôt wish others well, I don‚Äôt wish you well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if you actively refuse the vaccine and wearing mask knowing you‚Äôre endangering others then if you get sick I better see you refusing medical services too
1866	109641	Hi I'm a budding virologist, if there is a longform that explains if it is normal to start and stop specific vaccines like this...Please send me way for my daily COVID read...
1867	110791	@CTVNews Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way but, would she give the COVID-19 vaccine to her kids? Would Trudeau? I presume that is what they would be asking us to do.
1868	109887	@DrGregorSmith No need for the so called vaccine. The MHRA has enough evidence on the yellow card system to declare COVID-19 vaccines unsafe for use in humans. Dr Tess Lawrie
1869	109832	@POTUS or whoever is in charge of what happens with the COVID-19 I just wanted to say that if the vaccine doesn't go well and if people keep going out and partying and all then I think there should be another lockdown for a week or so. Nobody come at me for this please.
1870	111687	2Sooner or later everyone will get it if the vaccine/treatment is not found.Social distancing might be a precaution today , tomorrow it will be a lifestyle. #coronavirusinindia #COVID19 #Covid_19india #CoronaWarriors #CoronaUpdatesInIndia #coronavirus
1871	112386	Right now we are experiencing a world without one particular vaccine. If only we could do a split screen to show the world without any, just to see, just to check. #VaccinesWork #VaccinesSaveLives #COVID„Éº19
1872	110735	And the biggest problem is if unchallenged these narratives are self-fulfilling. The policy gets shaped to the narrative -- why work harder to get limited vaccines to people who don't want them? We just went through this with overdoses and black drug users.
1873	112874	The benefit does not outweigh the cost of widely testing. In contrast, the targeted testing strategy we've employed so far has not led to community spread. Furthermore, even if everyone tested negative, without a vaccine, we can all still contract COVID19 the next day.
1874	108719	@jeenasingh5 @DcpNorthDelhi @DelhiPolice There's no other way. Herd immunity is the only way because the virus has already mutated into 40 strands.We must assume there won't be any vaccine for COVID-19 in the immediate future and take it head on.
1875	109468	Exactly. There will NEVER be a zero rate of infection. A vaccinated person can still develop flu if the infecting virus strain is different than the vaccine strain. An educated guess is made each year to select the flu vaccine strain to use. Covid will be the same.
1876	108884	Please inject me with this üôÑMy body is screwed up but I don‚Äôt get a cold #jabjabjabbyjab #makeitmakesense
1877	110664	I say if countries or particular group of people do not want to get #Vaccine they should lose right to travel outside of their country until they do get it. Enough with stupidity!

Strange how BP can find a vaccine so fast but we can‚Äôt cure CANCER,the money makes for BP, hmmm, govt scares me 2
1881	111151	@eddierowan6 Eddie do you not think that if there was a credible vaccine for Covid19 they would have used this? It‚Äôs not the fact they don‚Äôt want us well they want to stop the people from dying.
1882	201836	I‚Äôm finally COVID-19 vaccinated and so much weight has been lifted from my entire being. For those who are iffy about the vaccine, my side effects (chills and soreness) really was just 1-2 days. I will take that over the virus ANYDAY üòá‚úåüèº
1883	112619	In my opinion, the miniscule covid virulence for this age group does not warrant any new unknown risks from a vaccine. Especially if we are reaching herd immunity levels.These efforts are better spent on assisting 3rd world countries with their vaccination strategy.
1884	107826	"Folks.Invermectin is an anti-parasitic. Prescribed to battle parasites. Thus the ""anti,"" then ""parasitic.""COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, is a virus. Right in the name. Again.Antiparasitics are not indicated in the treatment of viruses. Targeted vaccines? Are."
1885	111923	Just stop with the Bullshit, Covid doesn't fn exist, until you get the vaccine that isn't a vaccine.... besides that, how tf do you know you have something that THERE NO VALID TEST FOR?! FK THIS DUMB ASS WORLD!
1886	112248	@KindeandTrue In Dec 2019, Moderna/NIAID signed a contract with Ralph Baric to research mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates by performing ‚Äúchallenge studies‚Äù in humanised mice.Any legitimate government would‚Äôve made everything around this research public after 2 years into this ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù.
1887	110732	The issue is that all USA federal employees, including army personnel, are required to have the covid-19 vaccine. People who would get it have already gotten it. People who wouldn‚Äôt get it just wont get it. I would be surprised if someone changed their mind on the vaccine for 50k
1888	202254	I read about this last week. I would prefer Moderna for a booster, if it is available when my turn comes.My first shot was Pfizer: slept almost the whole of the next day but no other effects. Moderna... I woke the next day and it felt like someone had amputated my arm lol.
1889	111909	Are vaccines helping? Do they assist humans or mutation?Seriously, who knows if they are better than the human immune system?Perhaps they are able to minimize the impact of the viruses effect?
1890	109582	@Loyd71460097 The COVID vaccine‚Äôs goal is to protect us from coronavirus. How is a simple vaccine injection meant to demoralise individuals and segregate them, based off what? What is this New World Order you refer to? It sounds a lot like the Thousand Year Reich to me, I‚Äôm just curious.
1891	112500	is this the vaccine approved by trump and pence?i can't take my chances when i'm dead, so i'll stay alive.thanx anyway, tho.

1913	111418	@CelticAnarchy It's an interesting question! But it would need to be an antiviral that's1. Effective at removing most strains of coronavirus, it can't be retooled every year like a vaccine2. Have side effects mild enough for OTC usage, not likely because antivirals are rarely mild on the body
1914	112495	this is why ppl that are like ‚Äúhow did they come up with the vaccine so fast??‚Äù don‚Äôt make any sense bc it has literally BEEN HERE for YEARS.

1917	110912	If somebody discovers a vaccine for the Coronavirus, it will be interesting to see how many people refuse it.
1918	112068	I read there has never been a vaccine for any coronavirus. True? Yet they are gonna bang one out for COVID-19 in 9 months? Money would have nothing to do with that, would it? I mean a vaccine for the common cold would cripple the OTC drug companies. Right?
1919	112766	@ArcticTartan @PamBucci @Craig_A_Spencer Just like with the vaccine, is it still possible for a person with ‚Äòimmunity‚Äô to transmit the novel coronavirus? Even after receiving the vaccine, people are being advised to continue to follow all the COVID-19 precautions. There‚Äôs still a lot to learn about SARS-CoV-2.

1926	108056	@buttonbox21 @frederickone Only way we are going to get rid of COVID-19 for good is a vaccine, it is not rocket science, otherwise year after year it is going to keep coming back and we will be in lockdown after lockdown of the lockdown and people like you will be responsible.

2050	108600	@germinal42 @benshapiro Coronavirus spreads through the air. Nobody can stop the spread, especially not the vaxxed who can still catch and transmit the virus. So No he is not in the high risk group and yes he is fit and healthy otherwise he would not be #1. How fit/healthy are you sitting in judgement?
2051	201891	Someone on my timeline has just asked me why, if all care home residents have been vaccinated, do carers have to be vaccinated? I‚Äôm sitting here thinking why not just get the jab and be done with it. If you don‚Äôt want the vaccine then don‚Äôt be a carer.
2052	108768	Yes. I‚Äôll sign a waiver or whatnot if I have to. This virus has been terrible but we can‚Äôt live in fear for the rest of our lives. Plus, if they do have a Covid-19 vaccine in the future I would vaccinate, too.
2053	112497	I blame it on CDc who funded Wuhan lab that created#WuhanVirus  this is the same scam, create a disease then vaccine, they iwn patent on Ebola, MERs, SARS they are a vaccine stire scare you do you run snd get it#FauciTheFraud #Plandemic
2054	111761	Hey @sailorrooscout this may be a silly question but I cannot stop wondering why we have/may need vaccines specific to variants but one testing kit can detect all variants of the coronavirus. Any pointers on this? Thanks
2055	108805	Anyone who try to force any  vaccine on me or my kids will meet the Lord rite then and there. I will gladly give my life and place in heaven to rid the world of this satanic fucks.
2056	109406	NO elected official should get the Covid-19 vaccine before EVERY SINGLE willing private citizen has received it.Politicians can be replaced. Mike Pence isn't essential personnel. There is LITERALLY a system in place that replaces him if he's ever unable to do his job.
2057	111048	@Burgerfacemcta1 @lisastoi @BeeNewsDaily @SRCC @SpeakerPelosi The flu? Why would you bring up the flu? What a stupid contention, does the novel coronavirus have a vaccine, treatment, or accessible testing yet?
2058	108169	I‚Äôm not going to even slightly sugarcoat it, but watching the back and forth over the COVID-19 vaccine has been painful. I‚Äôm a freedom-loving patriot just like the next American, and putting my own views aside to support the freedoms of others has been difficult.
2059	202267	@myogiadityanath @UPGovt My Mother and my  Sister went to Mathura. There plan was to return back to home in Hoshiarpur (Punjab). Due to Covid-19 all trains were cancelled and they are struck in near village at Mathura last 40 days .My mother is senior citizen. Sir,Please help me
2060	111073	Vaccines promised as safe?Perhaps they should've tested the various vaccines on Tory politicians first, before using us as their unwilling guinea pigs. If they survive it, then it's all good, if they all die, it's still all good!Isn't it? üòâ
2061	110546	What all this highlights is that big pharmaceuticals can obviously not keep up with virus mutations. Vaccines are obsolete within weeks of distribution. All the more reason to waive patents and open up manufacturing to speed up vaccine roll-out. #PeoplesVaccine
2062	107717	Myth: If someone already had Covid they don't need the vaccine.Fact: Covid-19 reinfection has happened and having covid does not lead to immunity to the disease.

2066	108078	@Daily_Express Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
2067	111672	I really struggle to comprehend this. We knew 11 months ago vaccines were coming. We knew there would logistical hurdles. How this plan wasn't put together and streamlined A YEAR AGO blows my fucking mind. There are no words for this level of incompetence and negligence.
2068	111658	"@apc_0712 Like I said, no vaccine has ever been made to act in such a way! Name some other so-called ""vaccine"" that is like the covid-19 ""vaccine"". You can't! Does NOT exist. Smoke that in YOUR damn pipe"
2069	109493	@xelantfriar I know i sound like a broken record, but there have never been a successful vaccine for a coronavirus. Ever. Herd immunity is our best bet. Hoping for a successful vaccine but history says it will be a challenge
2070	110382	7) so why get the vaccine if they do not work? Why all the propaganda and lies about Covid19? The government is not interested in our human health or saving lives, so please do not feed us your diatribe and lies that you are.
2071	108000	@Hashemimohsin @AP Novel coronavirus will die. The best thing about vaccines is that they will keep you alive even if you catch a Novel Coronavirus. Most novel Coronavirus patients rely on their own immune system to get better naturally, so as long as you don't die, you'll get better slowly.
2072	110948	To all my followers. DO NOT get the Covid19 vaccine. It is the mark of the beast. It has an ingredient called Lucifer Ray's to track every single movement we make. It will change your DNA because it is made from animal and fetal DNA.Along with chemicals that will kill you.
2073	109805	Once declared a pandemic,your fundamental rights get seized. You have no right to get no vaccine. You need to obey them at any cost. And there's a sinister design to it now!! Hr disease pandemic q? And why only 'PANDEMIC' ?There's surely a lot more going on. And all EVIL!!
2074	107680	An interesting short read. It is amazing to think how quickly scientists were able to produce the first vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine! #OneYearOn

2076	108423	@Apersonalview2 @LouiseChang1485 @themood2020 Yes, Bill Gates, the guy who for the past 2 decades has been preaching about reducing the global population by 25% now wants to save us all with his vaccine. They don't want to protect, they want to sterilise us. Coronavirus is just their excuse to proceed.
2077	112257	This guy is still in the process of announcement while hoarding Covid-19 vaccines that are dentrimental to save the world population. How could he be so naive and ignorant?If another country had hoarded Covid-19 vaccines, he would have instantly punished with sanctions.Hypocrite!
2078	112863	"Gotta love how all these news agencies KEEP saying ""approved"" in reference for the vaccines. They intentionally word it, ""approved for USE"" because they're trying like hell to 'lie without lying' (as I call it.)NONE OF THESE SHOTS ARE APPROVED."
2079	108929	@PaulCroft56 @DonnellyStephen @roinnslainte @LeoVaradkar @gavreilly @ZaraKing @MichealLehane @FergalBowers Seems like it.. The only COVID-19 vaccine being offered at the moment¬†is Comirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer)¬†and¬†maybe Spikevax (Moderna)¬†if it becomes available, however, my Mum can take neither!!
2080	112276	"@DMinghella From the outset, the WHO REFUSED to accept even mention of alternative treatments of what is in fact just a coronavirus.  Reason being that a vaccine mandate can only take place if no other measures are effective.  So everyone was silenced. That's our World ""Health"" Organization."
2081	108502	Coronavirus has changed my belief that all vaccines aren't necessary. If you have an ailment, and we have a cure, go get your diseased-self vaccinated!

2083	109891	@MwanaMorogoro @jgwajima Let him speak against this poison you call COVID-19 vaccine.  This is a free country, not only to support government agenda but even going against them if they're not with any intended good.
2084	108163	U can only collect and sacrifice by murder. The coronavirus  is not natural. If people think the vaccine is meant to harm you, the idea that they created the virus is not too far fetched. Calculated Chaos. Souls have power.
2085	110771	I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm the very last person to get the COVID-19 vaccine, so long as my mom feels safe getting groceries on her own again.
2086	109648	@SkyNews What‚Äôs the point, how stupid, if people are 97.9% likely to survive with Covid19 why would you take a vaccine with only 90% effective in preventing Covid19.I won‚Äôt be taking the Vaccine....
2087	201807	So I‚Äôve finally relented and decided to get my COVID-19 vaccine. I‚Äôm scheduled to receive my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine tomorrow morning. I didn‚Äôt come to this decision lightly and have been struggling with it for a while now.

2096	108737	What do y‚Äôall not get? People are dying- is that not enough of a reason to stop partying, stop sports, and to socially distance? Y‚Äôall are acting like you can do whatever you want until the vaccine gets here.
2097	112461	This news could be groundbreaking in the hunt for a Covid 19 Vaccine. The Vaccine is the Silver bullet when it comes to defeat Covid 19.
2098	107709	@MarnixvdBroeke Data from where? And that may well apply to Coronavirus that humans have an immunity to it there are vaccines for. There is a reason that COVID-19 is referred to as a ‚Äònovel‚Äô Coronavirus.
2099	108669	@PoliticusSarah @politicususa Of course he did- he was told to before Russia released Covid19. There is a vaccine too. No one in place to regulate it. No one gets it.

2103	111498	Providing the coronavirus vaccine via private healthcare is an immediate moral thing to do. Private sector will find their own ways to source it and won‚Äôt use the NHS supplies. I for one will NOT take it at an NHS facility and will wait for private healthcare, and pay for it
2104	111567	@mcallcott @jerrythegooner I AM a qualified MD. If you have to booster yourself every 6 months, or so, then it‚Äôs like getting the common cold. BTW, the common cold IS A CORONAVIRUS. There is NO CURE for the common cold because IT‚ÄôS CONSTANTLY MUTATING ! HELLO !!

2107	110941	With all these photos of leaders and politicians getting the COVID19 vaccine injection, I haven't seen any doctors, nurses or any frontline workers getting theirs.Is there a chance they know something we don't...
2108	112190	@slava_pestov It‚Äôs not quite so simple.  A vaccine for coronavirus is not likely to be as effective as other vaccines.It won‚Äôt necessarily induce total immunity or complete protection.  And capitalism will impede distribution.Masking and social distancing will be with us for a few years.
2109	110599	@CBSNews Fact - Vaccinated individuals can still get Covid-19 and spread it. The vaccine only lessons the symptoms if you get it and does NOT prevent you from getting it! This is ridiculous!

2112	110230	@Skitty_Bard @crownarmourer @Reuters @Holbornlolz UK normally has a vaccine damage payment of ¬£120k, tax-free. But like I say, if you want to be a guinea pig, go ahead. I wouldn't touch it with a bargepole - assuming, of course, they get one (it'll be a first for a coronavirus if they do).

2164	111395	What comfort is there for anyone in LTC care or their family that any worker taking one week education on Covid19 or having a medical exemption ( WTHISTHAT) can keep them safe ? What ? Get the vaccine. If your fear of the vaccine lets you make others deadly sick, get a diff job.
2165	108202	This is why we can't have nice things in this country -- B/C there is far too large a portion of our population who refuses to take a safe, effective, free vaccine, but who will gladly ingest livestock dewormer...
2166	109177	@toleafoa_ I read an article about how they wouldn‚Äôt guarantee a coronavirus vaccine to be affordable for everyone because they need the private sector to invest.

2172	112256	@IanLaveryMP The objective was to flatten the curve.Anyone who believes that you can stop viruses without a vaccine is insane it will distroy everything else if you try.There is no vaccine for SARS CoV1 2003 MERS CoV or coronavirus that cause 30% of Colds.Stop living so that you don't die!

2174	110413	Clarification that‚Äôs not 100% true, the flu vaccine is made using different techniques and not an mRNA vaccine. There are currently 3 different ways influenza vaccines are generated. The Covid vaccine is first mRNA vaccine but that technology has been in development for 30yrs.

2178	111296	The side show is coming &amp; we hope there's not one news agency that falls for it. Trump getting a vaccine on TV? Oh please, supposedly he had covid, although it could have been re-election ploy, for all we know, its saline. means absolutely nothing, NOTHING! He has no transparency
2179	109121	Madagascar made a coronavirus medication, the world rejected it because it is from Africa. The West made a vaccine, we are forced to take it without questioning it, WHY? By the way Madagascar only has 42,800 cases &amp; 958 deaths, way lower compared to countries taking the jab

BRICS is not for the needy
2193	108992	As the looney left tries to force vaccine mandates, the makers of the vaccines are now admitting the vaccines don‚Äôt work.  If they did work, they would not be suggesting boosters two months after vaccination.  Wake up, sheeple!

2196	111680	Why do all these conservative Republican @gop suddenly want the first Covid-19 vaccines?? Don‚Äôt they keep saying it‚Äôs a fake virus?? Were they lying?
2197	110087	Another angle to consider - the first vaccine w/ an EUA will enjoy an unprecedented infusion of public-private funding + manufacturing. There are incredible resources primed to go. We don‚Äôt don‚Äôt want to unleash these resources on what turns out to be the ‚Äúleast good‚Äù vaccine.
2198	111051	@PolitiBunny @DeAngelisCorey My daughters are RNs and caught COVID19 while serving on the front lines during the pandemic. They are barely allowed to work because they refused the jab. They are already immune!

2200	110967	When you see so many #COVIDIOTS out and about, getting too close in shops etc, I do think once we've all been offered the vaccine, we just let it rip. It will kill some of the idiots and many will get long #COVID19 but as least we can all just get on with our lives.@BBCNews
2201	108904	Question for those that know: if Biotech updated their mRNA vaccine to target the Delta variant instead of the original version, will they need to do trials again or can they go straight to the market? #Pfizervaccine #coronavirus

I‚Äôm worried the v is going to destroy their immune system and they are going to have to rely on a ‚Äúbooster‚Äù for coronavirus and flu for the rest of their lives. Imagine tge control they will have on people when they rely on the government to live. In comes digtal passports
2206	109434	@GovWhitmer Why is taking so long with covid19 vaccine what's going on why everything is slowing down now . ?
2207	109987	@Evar_Galois @strauss_matt Dying from Covid-19 or any reason is never good news. It is very sad, but is  just part of the reality in pandemics like this. We can't do much to avoid it, if we have no vaccines. In case of this virus, we didn't until now. Better times are ahead.
2208	109218	@MarkHubbard33 @Mihi_Forbes Further  the spike protein in Covid-19 vaccines is genetically modified to enhance the immune response and to stop it binding to cell receptors in the same way the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein would. Hope this clears things up
2209	112627	@jonathanec12 @ScottGottliebMD It's saying that we won't get herd immunity from the vaccine but if we get COVID-19 it will be less likely to kill us. What do you think it says?
2210	111381	@elemental @ASlavitt Where are those immunologist who understands that this coronavirus attacks humans who have an unhealthy body metabolism and pH factorsWithout a vaccine immunology and immunotherapy are the only way to combat this virus.It's an RNA protein has a fatal attraction for malnutrition
2211	108708	Could someone please ask Dr. Fauci why a vaccine will confer immunity that actually contracting the coronavirus doesn‚Äôt? #COVID19
2212	108244	So what happens is FDA only approved Pfizer and not moderna. How does everyone get boosters if they originally got moderna or JJ shot? Your not suppose to missmatch the vaccines. I think this is a important question to figure out before mandating  vaccines. #FDA #VACCINE #COVID19
2213	110959	It's GOT to be this way.We've got to save our country.If we have to fire people to do it, so be it.They need to simply get the vaccine.I don't feel sorry for them.It's their choice. üë†

All the vaccines are trash that is why influenza is so heavily monitored or was until Covid-19 became popular. The only risk is the persons age or current condition before infection.

2228	112508	With uncontrolled spread in various places (including India) there is a risk of a new vaccine resistant variant springing up.So the studies that say I'm safe from the standard variants are not good enough when I don't know the travel history of the person on my sidewalk.

2281	108021	The findings show that the body‚Äôs immune system is able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 in many ways, dispelling fears that the virus may elude ongoing efforts to create an effective vaccine.
2282	108085	@JackReb65 @spectatorindex There is actually no set time the body produces the spike proteins for after having the mRNA. This is a trial, there is no long term data whatsoever to prove that it breaks down. 12 year olds don‚Äôt get admitted with severe COVID-19 symptoms, but they do after the vaccine though!
2283	201812	Sputnik V vs Astrazeneca/Johnson and Johnson etcRussia Federation versus the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland/USACovid-19 and the vaccine shenanigans are just wars of dominance amongst the powers.Possibly why Kenyans no longer welcome to the UK for allowing the Rus vaccine!
2284	109387	@Extralien @YorkusMarcus @Mannon17947862 Any vaccine risk is going to be VERY small, trials will have caught out significant bad reactions, only safe vaccines make it. Perhaps 1 in a million risk from the vaccine at WORST. Around 1 in a million currently die from COVID-19 EVERY DAY !! Take the vaccine please ! Silly boy
2285	112748	Why put a Dail motion when the Dail doesn't decide who gets the vaccine? seems like a motion for social media rather than actually substantive
2286	110698	I'm not gonna be going out till they have a vaccine for covid-19,I'm only gonna go out for necessitys #coronavirus  #Illinois
2287	109929	my southern 82 year old aunt got the pneumonia vaccine and is very convinced that will protect her from getting the coronavirus... lord give me have strength
2288	112176	@cbracken20111 @bas9295 @GovMikeDeWine @DrAmyActon It's not that easy since the medical people on the Federal Coronavirus Taskforce still believe another wave os coming this Fall. China says they already are experiencin a second wave with virus mutations that are is hitting people harder. Any vaccine will likely be nect year, if
2289	109491	@BostonGlobe Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
2290	108874	I commend people who do their part in fighting this virus - whether they are in the frontlines or simply staying at home. I believe we can all get through this. We can flatten the curve. A vaccine would be coming soon. Many people will recover. There is hope. #coronavirus

2293	110517	@AllisonPearson The thing people forget is that coronavirus is a super vaccine against coronavirus.Some groups need a gateway vaccine like pfizer, AZ etc ... But ultimately it's the infection that will give long term protection.
2294	107846	@JacobAchorn @PeterMDavies80 @MissvalCa @RogerMarshallMD @mattdizwhitlock And every animal trial  for those coronavirus vaccines failed. Guess what? They skipped animal trials for this one
2295	111586	@eagle4congress I agree to all except the vaccine. It's not safe. They came up with it too fast. Cancer and lupus don't have cures. And, these diseases have been around much longer than this coronavirus.
2296	107892	if you chewed on polly pocket shoes when you were a kid do NOT worry about what is in the coronavirus vaccine
2297	110015	All these numbs, Which covid are they testing for. Strain1 and 2 behave differently but there's gonna be mutations within and outside of those. Apparently the old vaccine  don't work if you've had the old covid before and apparently the new one doesn't work on the super strain.
2298	202360	Y‚Äôall can still catch COVID-19 with the vaccine just like the Flu. However, the flu shot is FDA approved AND you at least have options on how to cure it. With COVID-19, you‚Äôre just winging it and hoping for the best.
2299	111466	Good thing we have an endless supply of ever growing debt to just keep dumping money (foreign aid) and vaccines on the rest of the world...  glad my tax dollars are going to this and not the crumbling infrastructure in my city.
2300	109550	@MattHancock  Great news the Coronavirus vaccine has been stockpiled, I‚Äôm assuming you will be one of the first volunteers to get it, Am I right in thinking that ????
2301	111079	@NPR I'm no scientist,. but if you have taken all available shots, and they can still catch and spread Covid19.I would say the Vaccines don't work very well...
2302	111127	Based on Twitter worst side effect of COVID-19 vaccine is the inability to stop bragging about getting it. Like a vegetarian needs to tell everyone that they are a vegetarian is the only reason I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt eat meat. #vaccinesideeffects
2303	112743	@MetcalfeDavid Everyone is different David, my mom‚Äôs tested positive for covid19 after having the jab but has no symptoms, my partner has had the jab and felt lousy for 2 days after, others have had no effect. I‚Äôm gonna have it when offered, as I see it the only choice to get back to normal?
2304	110550	@Arron_banks @BorisJohnson @DominicRaab there has been no vaccine for common cold (coronavirus or rhinovirus) for 70 yrs.  Only testing, tracking, isolation and COUNTING accurately will achieve what is required.  Looks like the virus is in charge until the Tory party step it up. https://t.co/lqi9n10phX
2305	108172	Just saw on TV that two VACCINATED US Olympic athletes just tested positive for covid19. Again it has to be asked, why is the government pushing a vaccine this hard that may or may not work??
2306	202010	@cactuskash Yeah but Martinez would have scored and had the Covid-19 vaccine in his back pocket, so...
2307	108950	@Quartermills1 @DavidWeiss9 @RealKidPoker In fairness, a lot of this is still unknown so the informations is always going to chance. We don‚Äôt know how effective vaccines are yet or for how long. We‚Äôve never been able to fully get rid of some coronavirus (flu/ common cold/etc). There‚Äôs a real chance covid 19 is around...
2308	109669	@danschmohe @NickPonticello We try, they're still quarantined and will be till there's a vaccine they can take. We do all the shopping and a good chunk of the chores around the property.  No way are my folks gonna get COVID19 if I can help it.

2310	112636	Guys we don‚Äôt want to be Europe. That variant is bad. Mask up. Get vaccine soon as you can.  Be safe!
2311	111542	We can't wait forever for something that we don't know when it's gonna come. Leave us to drink our lengana in peace. We don't want to die while waiting for a vaccine if we can use our herb. We'll drink it and be healed like we always do.
2312	111103	@lukeisamazing they haven't been able to make a vaccine for any human coronavirus since the first human coronavirus was identified in 1965, but I'm sure they'll figure it out right away this time!
2313	108312	I got both jabs, but I do not believe that anyone should be forced to have the vaccine.I am against Covid passports so much so I've deleted the NHS APP. My support is with everyone against the Covid19 passports. Yep I am a @Conservatives Member. @BorisJohnson man up.
2314	110950	@SenatorKapenga You‚Äôre an IDIOT, Republicans like you made wearing a mask as well as the vaccine political‚Ä¶..I can state w/direct knowledge people showing up in the ER with #COVID19 are the ones who DIDN‚ÄôT get the vaccine‚Ä¶.keep wearing ur Trump/Pence mask showing all you are a #MAGAMoron

2319	111066	@juicyjonjames @AaronTampaNole @MaryannKay @BradleyWhitford @BarackObama My point is that Swine Flu after 5 1/2 months WITH NO VACCINE. NO VACCINE. DURING THAT PERIOD* had killed only 4k in the world, while COVID-19 has killed 86k in the U.S. alone and 300k worldwide *in under 4 months*.  You saying a vaccine kept H1N1 #s &lt; COVID-19 makes no sense!!!
2320	109208	@makumbi_k2 I think you guys are failing to real issue here.... How many people have died from covid-19 in SA and globally so far!? All nations are doing their bit to find a vaccine asap, and there are volunteers of the vaccine and if you don't want. You are not forced to take it.
2321	201921	I cried quite a bit today but also was FINALLY able to schedule my first appointment to get the COVID-19 vaccine üò≠‚ú®
2322	110547	"Why? It's just a flu and it's safe to send your kids back to school.Clearly, if we wait just a little longer it will just go away.And this the easiest coronavirus in the history of coronaviruses to fix, so a safe &amp; effective ""warp speed"" vaccine will magically appear soon."
2323	109395	@talkRADIO coronavirus vaccines have no long term data and yes would never ever have a flu jab as effacy  low &amp; it damaged my mothers health.
2324	112293	Is it just me who thinks they are coming up with new shit to scare ppl and make them take the vaccine?
2325	112932	@hello2youz @king_wynn2810Q @Craig97640805 I mean it‚Äôs all out there. If you want to decide that this vaccine is not a failure, I will view you as pathetic and in denial. The vaccine is not effective, it is not safe, and wait for peak coronavirus season and that ADE to hit. It already has and we aren‚Äôt even in winter.
2326	109667	@Sharon81243753 @guypbenson We‚Äôll never have herd immunity. Respiratory virus 101. There‚Äôs always a dominant respiratory virus. Most times it‚Äôs an influenza virus. Sometimes it‚Äôs a coronavirus. They never go away and no ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù or mask will change a thing. Influenza will figure out how to be #1 eventually
2327	109614	@LukeMeliaTCh @InkedUpSHAQ You do know a vaccine is already in very advanced stages right? Same as Smallpox, Meningitis, Polio and others Coronavirus has already came to humans previously and has been broughtnto zero cases the same will happen with this strain

2334	112477	Question, how do you feel about taking a vaccine for the coronavirus? Or for your family you know all vaccine is poison you know that right none of it is healthy none of it is save all vaccines are poison. That‚Äôs why they plan to force it on us.
2335	202156	Well, that's me all jabbed up. Second dose just received. #AstraZeneca so not looking forward to the next 72 hours but it's better than COVID-19 or Long Covid! If you're offered jabs, please take them! üôè Let's get back to some normality! https://t.co/jfYx7TDrge
2336	110492	I will preface this by saying I am not antivax. My kids are utd on all their vaccines.  This however is a completely new experimental shot with too many side effects to just shove under the rug.
2337	111619	? If you're suffered from covid-19 and you're admitted in hospital plz don't take vaccine. Because vaccine has work on immunity top to bottom in the first time and patient also loss immunity so my opinion is avoid vaccine if you are admitted.

2348	111246	@torreymspears A Coronavirus mutates so fast. It mutates at every infection of a new host. Your vaccine cannot keep up with that and they know it. The Flu doesn't mutate, it drifts and shifts. LOL!  They can't get the Flu vaccine to work properly yet they can get a CV vaccine working?
2349	110090	if you see these vaccine things claiming COVID19 injections, then stay out of their way, especially if you are HIV negative. Always gotta be using another twisted distortion of another's research. I am US Gov't employee #COVD19.

2351	110301	So remember, not letting the guidance out won't make the vaccines come any faster.  And if the vaccines aren't demonstrated to be safe, providers will not recommend them for their patients. The WH raising objections over safety surveillance is incredibly damaging to confidence.
2352	109626	@PeterNavarro45 @POTUS It is not the china virus. That‚Äôs racist. It‚Äôs either coronavirus or COVID-19.

2360	108871	@notinphilly69 @washingtonpost do you know how vaccines work? There are decades of research on how vaccines work. Coronavirus are NOT new, THIS strain IS. The more you know!
2361	112320	@robert_weiter @shootingsteady @kmoxnews @kmoxmaria @senatemajldr @VP @CBSNews Just to let you know, COVID-19 isn't going away without a vaccine. Even if everyone stayed home and never saw another human being for 3 months. It will always come back as soon as schools open and businesses reopen.
2362	109964	Logic tells me:If ppl can choose the vaccine they want = there will be a less popular vaccine = vaccine wastage Wastage of vaccine = wasting tax payers' money...unless we have Toyota inventory management techniques.

2364	109746	@BrianH618 I think it‚Äôs an absolute terrible idea. No way to even know if Covid-19 is better or worse in the spring. Also, even with vaccine, no guarantee fans, players or coaches will take it. One study said 2 out of 5 individuals surveyed said they would not take a vaccine.
2365	109851	I guess I'm curious as to why this is question with ONLY THIS vaccine. Why not MMR or dTap when we had a whooping cough or mumps outbreak in recent years? Those are easily transmitted, too. #VaccinePassports #vaccination

2368	108666	My question is this, The vaccine remains the same and yet the virus keeps mutating. How would a booster help if it is the same vaccine I took originally? Hope someone has an answer.
2369	112832	I would say it‚Äôs a positive step that pregnant women are now being offered the vaccine &amp; can make an informed decision about whether or not to receive it. Some won‚Äôt be able to get it, others will decide not to but the key word is choice. 1 in 2 is not a bad uptake so far either.

2380	110904	Should #Guatemala (and other countries) have to close their borders, it creates an interesting dilemma for those who chose to go abroad for their #covid19 vaccines. Because the country is one-two months behind them, so when they need a booster shot there could be lag.
2381	111706	So crucial for EVERYONE to get vaccinated. We've eradicated a slew of deadly diseases in this country this way. These vaccines work. PLEASE. Just do it. We will never truly be done with Covid-19 at this point, it's just too late, but we can regain our freedom and security.
2382	111302	@SnypLuciano @YouTube Yep but this is what we are dealing with on the left. This is why they are pushing for a vaccine and lying to the ppl that it is a vaccine for covid19. They are evil incarnate and have been planning this for decades.
2383	111050	@latimes yes this is true, i've shared meeting minutes from 2019 -conversations about coronavirus. how deadly it'll be - how it will spread - and which pharma will make the tests and vaccine.

I couldn't care less if you believe me or not but the fact is, you can spread Covid-19 even if you are double vaxed, my immunity will last a year, your vaccine will need 2 boosters a year.
2388	112360	The gap between countries who can &amp; can‚Äôt afford vaccines is growing every day. Vaccinating everyone, everywhere is our only way to be free from the #COVID19 pandemic. Tune in now for this once-in generation festival.

2395	111025	@Newsweek Does anyone really know how effective this vaccine is will it last 30 days 6 months or even 1 year in your immune system will you actually not get the coronavirus
2396	111405	How is this not going SUPER viral?They just admitted vaccines are worthless. @benshapiro Unpack this please
2397	107901	#COVID19 I will not be surprised if we have been told to take the vaccine 3 times a year, yep ones every 4 months. taking something that is so useless against any mutation.
2398	202378	I‚Äôve even considered getting a pneumonia vaccine. But I‚Äôm going to talk to my doctor first. I‚Äôve had pneumonia more than most people in my life (last one was about 14 years ago). So I‚Äôm considering it anyway. TBD. Gonna talk to my doctor first.
2399	109800	While we're on the topic of fat-phobia, who can tell me if fat people were included in any of the wildly successful COVID-19 vaccine trials? Cuz what you're NOT gonna do is give us a vaccine that's only made for thin people. (yes, there are precedents - like Plan B)
2400	109947	||‚Ä¢ So tomorrow my writer is going to get the Covid-19 vaccine shot at around 12:45pm. So glad I don't have to work tomorrow.

2402	110618	@CDCgov What I have to inquire about is not the testing. I‚Äôve heard pneumonia is what actually makes everyone so sick with covid19. If that is true why can‚Äôt potential victims of the virus get the pneumonia vaccine? I have COPD and no pneumonia since taking that vaccine.
2403	108123	There are certain problems with the Sputnik-V vaccine (this is the one being administered in the private sector). Details mentioned below:
2404	112923	Just a reminder, the rest of the  world is working together on developing a vaccine against #covid19 and the US is not included because they don‚Äôt trust Trump.

2409	108701	One problem with this plan is that the Indian Serum Institute (like our FDA) hasn‚Äôt issued an EUA for any of the COVID-19 vaccines manufactured in the U.S., so none can be administered there yet. The SII has approved Covidshield, based on the AZ vaccine, but not quite the same.
2410	109849	‚ÄúVaccines for the coronavirus is a frustrating subject. It could take a year, or 18 months to develop a successful vaccine for #COVID19. Most importantly, we want to creat a vaccine which can actually worked‚Äù
2411	107712	@FEDERMCF @FaheemYounus Exactly thatviscwhatcI am saying.I am unstupid enough to know facts such as...Vaccines have ingredients highly dangerous for the nervous system such as formaldehyde etc. Do you even know what is in your vaccine?Do you know Bill Gates owns the pattern for Covid19 (Phirbright)?
2412	111520	@EWoodhouse7 And THIS is why no one has been able to develop an effective coronavirus vaccine in decades!  Masks don‚Äôt work- vax doesn‚Äôt protect.  Let‚Äôs go back to the main truth- virus is gonna virus
2413	111968	No vaccine for HIV after 40 years of research.No vaccine for the common cold.ÔøºNo vaccine for cancer after 100 years of research. A virus mysteriously appears and within a year a vaccine is created and we are all expected to take it.Not. Happening! #COVID19
2414	110857	Okay normally this would be funny but this is just going lead to more not taking the vaccine and the longer we going have to deal with the pandemic.
2415	109441	February 25: ‚ÄúCDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.‚Äù  February 25: ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a problem that‚Äôs going to go away‚Ä¶ They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we‚Äôre very close to a Vaccine.‚Äù??

2417	110253	@HeidiWhitaker @POTUS What will they do. Arrest you if you don‚Äôt? They let dangerous criminals OUT of prisons to protect them from #COVID19 yet they will jail someone for not allowing a forced vaccine?
2418	110469	Why did we go for the cheap and less effective one? Why didn‚Äôt we go for the Phizer vaccine?Australia isn‚Äôt a poor country. But LNP members have stocks in Astra Zeneca so I guess their finances are more important that Australians, right Scomo?#auspol #ScottyFromPhotoOps
2419	108250	lol there it is, the deal with modernathe company who has never made a vaccine before yet is charging the highest price for a CV19 vaccine, all while insiders dump stock at unprecedented levels on the heels of their vaccine news driving up it's price
2420	109900	I have heard this same message 100s of times and my stance on taking the vaccine hasn't changed but now my football team says it that's totally going to change my opinion

2424	112275	@TeemoCarry @KeenwaAcai @DrEricDing They have clearly said they aren't injecting part of the virus like they have done in the past that can cause these reactions. You're assuming things with no proof. I rather have the vaccine with its very low chance of side effect to getting the Coronavirus with no vaccine
2425	110830	@GorillaSIX @uk_domain_names as in there is no approved vaccine yet...Not for SARS1, not for MERS and not for RSV...all 3 are coronaviruses that we have lived for a long time already...all 3 can cause pneumonia...and neither of them a vaccine...so COVID19 is treated like a VIP
2426	111578	@newsmax I know people who don't agree with getting the COVID-19 vaccine, but the politics they like &amp; listen to are saying we need to get a COVID-19 vaccine. And so those people are now saying we need to get a COVID-19 vaccine just because the politics they like &amp; listen to are saying it

2431	112341	I honestly had no bad reaction to the vaccine and I got it while pregnant and my baby is healthy and growing fine. It‚Äôs a choice to get it and I don‚Äôt judge people who don‚Äôt so don‚Äôt judge others who do get it.

2447	110842	@Arshathz your POV on this would be appreciated. Kindly enlighten us on how far is this going to be safe &amp; effective over an mRNA vaccine for their second dose? Are there clinical efficacy data for mixing and matching vaccines, such as clinical trials or real-world studies? #lka

2452	108643	Okay y'all, really? We are going to hoard covid vaccines? This is the moment we all help each other!! THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU RESTORE FAITH IN HUMANITY. Not the moment where you capitalize on this vaccine, over people's lives!!! Just stop, stop, and be human.
2453	109617	@MediaSequitur know the WHO is complicit in this. If you listen and watch the videos very carefully (watch them a few times) what you will notice is that it is an admission that the oral polio vaccine doesn‚Äôt work, causes paralysis, and yet they are advertising it anyway. So a COVID19 vaccine
2454	110590	@Intuitive1966 Im curious to know how the vaccinated get on when they catch the actual virus . Will it be fine or create the cytokine storm coronavirus vaccines are known for !
2455	111385	It‚Äôs apparently unpopular to say this as a communist, but vaccine mandates are good actually. It‚Äôs just a systemic issue where declining one can ruin your life.
2456	111158	@TrueLoserCorp66 @Tama_Rama_SR ‚Ä¶&amp; of course, that is impossible, which is why there have NEVER been effective vaccines for any coronavirus. Including, I believe, a common cold. So.

2510	111234	@AllisonLCarter Most are not anti-vax. They are anti-mRNA which they don't trust the technology which has no long term studies in humans. There also has been no successful Coronavirus vaccine due to ADE or the Common Cold would have had one. These are therapeutics as you still spread the virus.
2511	109345	@denise_dewald I would get a COVID19 vaccine in my eyeball every week if it meant we could end the pandemic
2512	112036	@Norma09 @Just_a_fox_ The COVID-19 vaccine has no mechanism for causing the virus because it contains no virus.
2513	110023	.@GovWhitmer just called for a vaccine that is free and safe for all. Sounds good to me, eh @uaem?#Drugprices #COVID19 #DemConvention2020
2514	111330	@scoot3r83 Given what we already know about covid I think there is sufficient data to say the vaccines are ‚Äúrelatively safe and effective‚Äù. Far from perfect but a great tool against covid19 and it‚Äôs complications. As for mandates, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a good idea. No one should be forced.
2515	111671	And in the wealthy countries people decline the #vaccine. They laugh in the face of covid til they are hooked up to their very own ventilator - #getyourshot
2516	110352	Remembering in 2007 when Gov. Perry mandated a vaccine for girls to prevent HPV and realizing there is no at the wheel in the mansion these days. A goat could do this job. It would just eat any ideas places in front of it.
2517	108381	@joimonki @lara_bolivar @nytimes I don‚Äôt remember anyone needing a polio vaccine every three months - bad comparison. Also animals do not get polio, but some do get Covid-19 -meaning we might always have an animal reservoir.
2518	109696	Please, everyone, keep wearing your #facemasks This is madness! #COVID19 #COVIDBooster won‚Äôt solve it all. Ugh üò©
2519	107864	#vaccinationCovid #CovidVaccine ive been largely shielding since March 2020. Ive been balancing the risks of my kids continuing to go to school because if their specific needs, my work requirements and the serious risk covid-19 has over me. I know some of my BME/BAME followers
2520	109539	I just don't care if I get baned censored or whatever you want to do I will never get the covid19 vaccine I have had covid19 last year and I am still alive and well at 60 year's old I feel great,stop the lies .
2521	111684	Yes, In a very courageous step he forgot to place an order for vaccines. Those alive may win, the dead has lost it forever.
2522	110358	"I'm in the US, but still. Movie theaters can enact all the ""safety"" measures they want, I'm NOT going to a show until there's a vaccine and #coronavirus is behind us. And I love movies! This is the hidden economic problem - open all you want, there's not going to be demand."
2523	111921	US banned too. I think the whole world now. The vaccine is testing now for the new variant covid19. Results will be soon.....
2524	109216	@joncoopertweets I get my annual flu shot at my local Walgreens, but they have never had any COVID-19 vaccine.
2525	109117	@Matthew_4_Trump @sweetrox76 Feels like a trial run....Covid19, the election fraud, the vaccine. How willing are we to be sheep??
2526	111020	@ShannonSharpe And I was fired from my job because I declined to take the covid-19 vaccine they discriminated against me based on religious preferences how is that any different me being fired because I'm black I'll wait? ü§î
2527	112322	@Cleavon_MD No obstetricians I know are recommending the Covid-19 vaccine for pregnant women. Just as they have not approved the vaccine for 0 thru 12 year olds. I am very sorry this beautiful woman died. We know nothing about her medical history, and it is not our business.
2528	111692	Ordinary developed countries strive to produce their own vaccines against coronavirus infection.However, Japanese only think about buying foreign-made vaccines.The Japanese do not consider increasing the burden on vaccine-producing countries.
2529	108648	Indeed. These are the numbers that a longer process would cover, hence the rapidity that many feel fearful about.When my turn comes around, I‚Äôll be having the vaccine:to protect my loved ones &amp; those who cannot have this.#COVID19Vaccine Such an incredible achievement.
2530	111043	@WideAngle_ @BreitbartNews Biden's coronavirus advisor Zeke Emanuel (Rahm's Brother) wants Biden giving out the vaccine to China and Everyone Else. While those in The US get the vaccine last it's how insane Liberals are.
2531	109734	Scientists around the world are working non-stop to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Catch up with the latest developments below ‚¨áÔ∏è
2532	201821	Looking forward to continuing my little trend of getting bubble tea after getting vaccinated against COVID-19 on Sunday for my booster üòåüßã
2533	109465	@RegionofDurham @AnitaOakville @JenOConnell_ @DurhamHealth Thank you. Keep up the great work you all do there and hope you keep on getting more vaccine supplies in a timely manner. Your updated Covid-19 vaccination website looks better too and very informative. I‚Äôm checking it every day for my turn üòâ.
2534	111721	Herd immunity: There are two paths to herd immunity for COVID-19 ‚Äî vaccines and infection.I'd rather get the virus than the vaccine.gov NEVER cures a problem by making it bettervoting won't fix this!
2535	109425	@BBCLBicker I wish and hope the vaccine works.  World coronavirus illness has surpassed South Korea's population.
2536	110533	2/4  In a world with anti-vaxxer numbers rising, we desperately need to: A) make sure any COVID-19 vaccine WORKS and is SAFE; and B) convince people to TAKE it. So what does someone as Ascientific and just plain stupid as DumpTrump do?
2537	108728	@LauraRbnsn Listen: God sent the coronavirus plague to punish this sinful world, fully knowing that scientists would seize the opportunity to implant the Mark of the Beast in the vaccine and distribute it to the Earth's population, paving the way for Antichrist just so... I'm exhausted  üò´
2538	111167	A year ago, you couldn‚Äôt even mention this without getting censored, banned or deplatformed. Just think what will be uncovered next year about vaccine safety. Tick tock.
2539	108857	#Covid19VaccineReport Don't just accept the vaccine because they say so. Find out what it is all about because you are still not safe after been vaccinated. Be wise
2540	108280	Every person that breaks lockdown rules and those that repeatedly do so whether fined or not...should be a the last to receive any COVID-19 vaccine! They obviously believe they are immune or simply don‚Äôt care so they should be given to those who respect this virus! #covid19
2541	108536	Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt care if he did? Honestly, do what you want just don‚Äôt force me. I‚Äôm not anti or pro vaccine. I‚Äôm anti mandate.
2542	112278	@TeamPelosi There is a vaccine against the Coronavirus, China has it, it does not say it because it would accept that it is guilty of spreading the Chinese virus
2543	110041	The covid19 vaccines are not vaccines. If you want to get sterilized or impotent, get a covid19 vaccine .
2544	111211	The anti-vaxer nonsense on Social Media is getting out of hand. Ignorant people undermining the brilliant work done to develop  #CovidVaccine so quickly. Already encountered this on Twitter today before seeing this
2545	111541	Tier 0 is the new normal...Remember people the flu is a coronavirus and there is a vaccine ... guess what? The flu is still around.Lockdowns are not because of a virus! A virus so deadly you need to have a test to know you have it...which can still be false üßê
2546	110400	@rheumacademy Is Covid-19 Vaccine SAFE for Pregnant Women ? ? ? HELL NO !!! Don‚Äôt you dare sign that paper unless you can prove 100 % there are absolutely NO BIRTH DEFECTS. (Testing will take 9 months plus 2 years) We don‚Äôt want any COVID BABIES.
2547	112868	my question is, how do we actually know if they are getting ‚Äúthe vaccine‚Äù and not water or some other shit instead
2548	109766	@ethanndg @Nlechoppa1 to cause that's what they want you to. People who have taken the COVID-19 Test, were healthy and after they took the test, then ended up positive with the Virus. The COVID-19 vaccine ain't a vaccine. It has a chip in it. That's why Bill Gates is tryna make it a Cashless society.
2549	108307	@jacorbol @Shwin1080 @malika_imani @letitiawright They are in my favor, that's for sure. Please do document your experience with the covid19 which is unlike any vaccine ever made before. Enquiring minds are eagerly awaiting our guinea pigs
2550	108054	Taylor Swift Will Sing ‚ÄòBetty‚Äô says coronavirus vaccine could be distributed to Americans before year's end #fakeheadlinebot #learntocode #makeatwitterbot #javascript
2551	112678	These people are so insane. Vaccines have been mandated before in the US. They don't have to get the vaccine if they don't want to, they just can't work in Federal, State, and City Governments or in Healthcare. üôÑü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2552	202451	On Sunday my 88yo mum tested positive for covid. Four days down the line and she's ok so far. Holding out and hoping things stay this way. üíôüôè #COVID19 #vaccine
2553	112761	If you're not worried about what's in the coronavirus vaccine, don't worry about what's in cigarettes.
2554	110712	If it's not confirmed that already having COVID19, doesn't mean you won't get it again, why are some places trying to implement this antibody testing in order to get off of house arrest &amp; go back to work? Why would a vaccine help if the real virus doesn't give you immunity?
2555	107869	Apparently, No vaccine is going to be rolled out for the Coronavirus for at least the next 18 months? This is getting scarier by the day. üòå
2556	110340	People itch for like ‚Äúpositive coronavirus news‚Äù and maybe my head is just fucked now but literally none of it makes me feel even slightly better it all looks exactly the same. Only news I will accept is ‚Äúquarantine lifted‚Äù or ‚Äúworking vaccine created‚Äù
2557	110624	@eNCA @_cosatu cosatis useless, thy wll say this until we get covid19 vaccine, toothless organisation
2558	108543	Got news for the UN, it will be a cold day in hell before my family or I, will take a covid-19 vaccine! News for Tedros and Gates, you will rot in hell before you or your minions force vaccines on my family!! Bold talk yes, bold actions by me, yes!! I do not need elites orders!!
2559	112753	I'm confused by all the different dates, and whether they mean the whole vaccine or half the vaccine. I guess the deliberate confusion is to help to continue with spreading herd immunity and fleecing the taxpayer? #Marr
2560	108763	@SenRonJohnson you might want to consider getting the vaccine! Unless you think your cow dewormer will protect you! ü§£ü§£ü§£
2561	108474	@ding_gang Malaria huh? I‚Äôve had my malaria shot and booster (the booster is a hum-dinger) I‚Äôm inclined to not believe this since a US Navy ship has #COVID19 and all sailors are inoculated for malaria in boot camp.
2562	110481	When a job trys to make you get the covid-19 shot saying its a requirement for the position but you got some for they ass üò≠üò≠üò≠ ‚Ä¶ I went &amp; got a doctors out saying I cannot get the vaccine . Ion even play like THAT
2563	109062	Thanks to everyone who's spoken up and called for an advanced vaccine rollout. Now starting in February. #COVID19vaccine
2564	110699	i‚Äôm honestly so so fed up of people thinking they‚Äôre scientists when they‚Äôre just not Highlights include:- why is no cure for cancer when we got a vaccine for covid-19 -covid-19 is just another flu -masks are filled with bacteria that will make us ill
2565	107839	@JaggerMickOZ The vaccinated don‚Äôt realize the Delta variant they‚Äôre getting now is weaker than the original Wuhan COVID-19 strain. They assume the vaccine is why it‚Äôs not worse. Wait until a new full strength variant hits this winter. I think that‚Äôs when the ADE will really kick in.
2566	110581	"I mean, it might work as a sales pitch. ""All y'all nakers are gonna die! The racist COVID-19 is genocide! Now get this vaccine!"""
2567	112105	First dose of the covid19 vaccine is now in my body. My arm hurts like someone punched it, but otherwise doing good!
2568	111469	Why are we not surprised. How can you possibly have a proven, fully tested and safe vaccine after only 7 months? What about the long term side effects, does anyone have a clue on that one? Doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
2569	109184	I would happily continue to live like a hermit until there is a vaccine if it means my son can start kindergarten on time in the fall.
2570	108707	People want to know what is in a #Covid19 vaccine, but they don't even check what they eat or drink. They swallow pills like they are nothing - and they don't even check ingredients. You know why? Because they wouldn't know what E171 means. But yeah, go on with your stupidity.
2571	112831	There is a cabal negatively smearing this and azithromycin in combination because it‚Äôs inexpensive.  They want expensive vaccines big money
2572	109496	@Tom_Fowdy Because it's a smart (though shady) thing to do. Only time will tell which vaccine trials work out and which fail. ESPECIALLY when there has been no successful human vaccines for a coronavirus yet developed.Not saying they DID it, only they have good reason to. Same for the US.
2573	110523	Looks like Oxford has the best chance at a vaccine then, they can increase the antigen count quite a bit unlike other phases 3 vaccines that are currently being tested.
2574	202135	I‚Äôm not a doctor but I‚Äôve seen people acting sceptical of the vaccine over this so I‚Äôll give my opinion. My dad got vaccinated and his arm was sore like when u get a flu shot. It probably isn‚Äôt something serious. I kinda need your arm not to be sore to play baseball
2575	111861	Can we get paid to get every vaccine from here on out? So can checks be sent to us for prior forced vaccines. My state is paying 100/person for Covid-19 vaccine. Lol so can we make that a paycheck for 100/vaccine since birth. Also every time we get the flu vaccine too. Lol!
2576	111004	When are they going to admit the vaccine does not work . And it looks like the vaccine gives you covid .
2577	110565	@SChad71593015 They never were able to develop a coronavirus vaccine. And when they tried back in the early 2000's all the lab animals died!
2578	108761	also the essay is about coronavirus vaccines and it‚Äôs actually cool as fuck so i‚Äôm here purely to ask if anyone would be interested in a thread about current corona vaccine research and how different types would work?
2579	112383	@WHO @Sophie_Mokoena @DrMikeRyan Q: Can I stop wearing my mask after being vaccinated?A: No. We don't have proof that vaccines protects you against Covid19. You can still get infected and infect others after taking the vaccine.
2580	112090	@hrkbenowen It will be a winter of joy!  The vaccine in itself is an infection of the cells, just like a virus infection.  It goes into the nucleus and instructs the cells to replicate a foreign body; that being the covid19 spike, a virus component!  Wish the vaxxed luck!  They'll need it.
2581	111107	@waffaisback @dona17_mc They‚Äôve actually been working on a coronavirus vaccine for a decade.  They just finally got funding to have the resources necessary to complete it.
2582	112361	@RobertEarnsha15 COVID19 is no better or worse than every other strain and every other virus or cold. If a vaccine is nothing but a small amount of the virus to allow me body to get over it, then I'll do the same on my own
2583	201854	That second covid-19 vaccine is starting to kick in. Feeling fatigued and some arm soreness, but it‚Äôs worth it.
2584	107760	I pray that these seniors families don't allow this to happen. This is extremely dangerous. Nothing is even known of this so-called Covid19 vaccine. The article gives no details concerning it.
2585	111812	They‚Äôre going to inject 100m Americans with Dr Trump patent snake vaccine days before the election? Or just announce it and hope it‚Äôs enough to win him some votes before people work it it‚Äôs a hoax? Either way everyone involved is a danger to the public
2586	112917	@POTUS @DeptofDefense - ENOUGH!  - make it a requirement while serving - we all had to get measles, polio, &amp; other vaccines to eradicate diseases and protect everyone.  This is no different.
2587	109295	There are millions of people around the world without access to any COVID-19 vaccines and they would kill to get one. Meanwhile Americans are going to continue to get sick and die this year because they think they are smarter than a virus. SARS-CoV-2 is endemic. It‚Äôs here to stay
2588	112365	No Vote No vaccine. This is business. So only in Tamil Nadu BJP is competing with Nota üòÇ. Never ever seen such a fool PM üôè
2589	111895	@pfizer company has developed #COVID19 vaccine. Interesting fact is that Pfizer is the who invented Viagra. So, Whoever have consumed Viagra can tell that how effective this vaccine will be. Is there anyone?
2590	108946	@Minapina7 I hope so, because Iran is not far from my country, but after the issue of the Coronavirus has ended and I have taken the vaccine so that I am allowed to travel...
2591	112424	Please be a hero and volunteer to test for a coronavirus vaccine. You can‚Äôt get coronavirus from the trials. It‚Äôs not a live virus. I would volunteer but there‚Äôs not a location near me. Check this out, please.  https://t.co/sD1qvlgb6R
2592	111903	These are the industries that @MassGovernor is destroying w/ his phased opening plan. Is it any wonder MA has the highest unemployment in the country? Big box stores never closed, meanwhile no parades until a vaccine. It‚Äôs nonsensical.
2593	109205	‚Ä¢The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is reported to be effective against the Kent strain of coronavirus, according to the Chief Investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial.
2594	108273	#COVID19 is not going to go away. It is something that will have to take its natural course and become a normal virus in our ailment pool, just like the flu. We cannot be contained to our houses until a vaccine is released to the public, in an estimated 12 to 18 months.
2595	111965	This is how coronavirus in feline (FCoV) looks like ‚òπÔ∏è Before we freak out, it cant be transmitted to human. Cats infected usually wont survive, it is currently untreatable. I only have seen vaccine for CanineCoV. Truly sorry for your loss.
2596	108022	@tractorbadger @LukeJohnsonRCP @Paulrichardsmig No it isn't going well for them. Not at all. But with foreign aid and known cures and preventive jabs they don't need to.Ask yourself this simple question.If COVID-19 isn't that bad because they have 'statisically lower numbers'Why has the planet locked down?

2598	109118	@KelvinBSP @johnpilger There's no such thing as a safe vaccine. They are never tested in double blind studies &amp; the covid 19 virus has not even been isolated let alone tested. Everyone has coronavirus in their system, the name for all flu viruses. Tests for the virus are not accurate.

2602	107727	@Pippov66 @GeorgeMonbiot That‚Äôs why vaccine equity is so important. The WHO has said that the whole world should have access to COVID-19 vaccines so we call all work in unison.
2603	111637	@funder Is it possible to gather some bats and study them? Why isn't there a bat specialist working on a covid19 platform? Go to the source. Find out why bats can carry their own vaccine and humans can't. A human  cannot handle viruses from bats but humans are larger in size.
2604	110089	in ireland we need to face up to the sad but true reality that #COVID19 is not going to stop till be have a vaccine but we can slow it right down and unfortunately a lock down is the olny way to do this there is no other way. We all know it as we need to wake up to fact that some
2605	107695	Being in law enforcement means following the rules. So why are police unions telling their membership not to comply with vaccine mandates? COVID-19 is the #1 cop killer in the nation. It. Makes. No. Sense.

Well Bonnie?
2621	111015	In my opinion we need to get used to live with ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù until vaccine is distributed to the population. Our grandparents lived during WWII. They worked, they even had concerts on the field and towns, dinners. It means we can live with corona too. Corona is better than war.

2624	109092	@RachaelGreen I agree and the majority of people would. Only 6% in the article said definitely not its a non story, most people would as long as there has been rigourous testing. Whether there can ever be a vaccine for a coronavirus is another debate. Sky news just making news out of nothing
2625	110280	@AdamNutter This doesn't make sense. In what instance would it be mandatory? Someone gets Covid19, either beats it or has to go to the hospital for medical assistance but refuses? Has the flu vaccine been mandatory by law in the USA @RepThomasMassie?
2626	112494	"Just try to get off all the markets emails and social media stuff you'll get from all these ""for profit commercial"" vaccine hubs"
2627	111017	It makes you wonder why Trump and the GOP didn't exploit the creation of the covid vaccine to earn votes, instead they weaponized it against the Dems and made it political. They were in a perfect position to capitalize on it. Why didn't they? #COVID19
2628	108934	@Travistritt Read slowly: When not enough people get vaccinated to reach herd immunity like for the diseases you mentioned, viruses canM U T A T E as Covid-19 did. So the vaccine needs to be check and tested so it can be even more effective against the mutations.
2629	107982	@hmca19 @WPaulJones2 @khangliter @duty2warn It isn't as if Coronaviruses are new, the first human Coronavirus was in the 60s, and a vaccine was developed using much of the research and testing they had done for SARS in 2003. Furthermore, mRNA vaccination is new but not unknown, they have been researching it for decades.
2630	108421	@chrissteinplays @GreatDismal Wait, if we take this vaccine it will not only protect from COVID-19 but taxes as well AND fix my vocal cords and music pitch?!
2631	112561	@southsider35th @molly24742136 @AmyJacobson @ChiPubSchools It‚Äôs a simple concept for everyone except right wing extremist fools.  The vaccine greatly improves your chances of not getting COVID-19 or of surviving the virus if you get it.  For anyone with an ounce of common sense that‚Äôs a great reason to get the shots.
2632	108750	@CKnorcal @RealCandaceO Actually a vaccine‚Äôs job is to prevent you from getting a disease. The COVID-19 vax does not do that do it is hardly a true vaccine. More like a therapeutic. So if you got the shot(s) you can still get sick, though likely not as bad. So not really a vaccine.
2633	108712	@POTUS I got my 1st Covid-19 Vaccine Shot Today (Moderna)üôèüèæPraise God for the Courage to get this done @POTUS
2634	112926	COVID-19 vaccine.   With this low IFR for kids and young adults, why take the chance on a new risky vaccine?  naturally built immunity better prepares the body for the next virus.... and immunity induced by infection is naturally selective resulting in lower HIT
2635	111739	@hrprogressive @edyong209 um... it is a coronavirus with animal reservoirs.  there are no sterilizing vaccines, and there never will be. it is NEVER GOING AWAY.  EVERYONE WILL EVENTUALLY GET IT.  if you aren‚Äôt old or fat you‚Äôre more likely to be struck by lightning than die of Covid.  really. Do the math.
2636	108386	Now that we have open borders and people coming into our country from all over the world bringing coronavirus-19 with them.  So now will they take the vaccine meant for USA citizens? Then will we be locked up in our homes or studio apartments for another year?
2637	109474	My mom getting her covid-19 vaccine really has me in tears this woman deserves the world for holding it down üò≠
2638	107935	@TONYxTWO It actually isn't a vaccine it is just a flu shot with strains they guess are going to be around that year. The covid19 vaccine will end up being the same thing, a shot. A vaccine is not needed every year. Just their way of making money and injecting shit into you, possible chip
2639	201876	This is so sad üíîMy uncle in his 60's got a blood clot in his leg after the jab... Had to have his leg amputated below the knee. üò¢
2640	111798	This past year has made me into more of soulless human robot than ever before, but there's something about my primary care patients who have survived the Khmer Rouge/ Cambodian Genocide now getting their COVID-19 vaccine in our clinic that gets me a lil emotional.
2641	108555	Not sure why it‚Äôs not being reported much but the Coronavirus has been found to have mutated in Denmark and would make ALL current trial vaccines worthless.
2642	109857	"""Govt may impose sanction on persons who refuse to take coronavirus vaccine ‚Äì Oppong Nkrumah"" You dont have what people are deemed to be refusing. procure it first, and let all above 18 take the jab, the malady doesn't know who a citizen is or an illegal resident is."
2643	111038	So did I get that right? The fellow in the control group dies after being injected with the existing meningitis vaccine (supposedly safety tested) and already on the market? and they've bypassed the double bling gold standard altogether. Nice.
2644	108559	#COVID19 mutation found in Denmark. Evolved in mink and transferred to people. This new mutation is immune to the future vaccine - so now all 15 mio mink in Denmark has to be euthanised. This was not on my 2020 bingo card #CoronaMutation
2645	107966	@Aiims1742 @apoorva_nyc I feel terrible for the Capitol grounds staff that had to clean up the mess they left behind. Hopefully everyone working on Capitol Hill has gotten a COVID-19 vaccine, but I doubt it. There's no doubt that the entire Capitol Hill complex is teeming with COVID-19 now.
2646	111651	So SARS-COV2 has mutated beyond the previous strains. How in the hell is a vaccine the world's developing now going to be effective against these new strainsüò¢üôÑ
2647	109185	I'm not vaccinated &amp; don't plan on it. That is my personal choice because I'm healthy. My immune system is good however if I had chronic illnesses that effected the COVID19 if I got it I would do the vaccine! I don't promote it or talk against it. It's a personal choice. MASKüò∑üé≠
2648	108353	What do I do if my employer tries to force me to take a COVID-19 vaccine under threat of losing my job? How do I support my family if I lose my job by refusing?I'm really scared!
2649	201860	Pause so people been dying, getting evicted and going hungry for over 7 months and got ONE check for $1,200 and y‚Äôall giving the second one IF we get a vaccine.. as a BRIBE ??? I have no words
2650	108969	@TheScientistLLC If it is so good why he was not vaccinated himself?What could be better for publicity -- Putin is getting publicly vaccinated with Russian #COVID19 vaccine?I guess, Putin is not so sure how well does it work or even tolerated.
2651	201972	Last night my friend‚Äôs Dad received a text notification of his vaccine appointment...on March 31st üôÑ Can you please get it together lads? This is beyond frustrating and ridiculously incompetent. #COVID19 #covid19ireland #COVIDVaccination

2653	112140	Good explanation for why the coronavirus vaccines need to be kept so cold, created using a little bit of organic chemistry
2654	108433	[P] FWIW, my mailman just dropped off 100 million doses of coronavirus vaccine. Gonna need some help getting it all down into my basement. MAGA!
2655	108048	@1stnamenumbers @JustATh27580793 @MLive I have nothing against vaccines, in fact all my kids are vaccinated. I'm just against a vaccine when the premise is: you NEED it to protect them when 99.999479% of kids ages 11-younger (ineligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine) have all survived without vaccine for 18 months
2656	108575	This is insane. Blocking those that want the vaccine?  How does that impact you?  How do we have so many moons in this country
2657	107990	‚ÄúSir Ian McKellen has become the latest celebrity to get the coronavirus...‚Äù*gasps*‚Äú... vaccine.‚ÄùFFS.

2659	110293	@Paul__Agha @TZ_na_Vijana They are very different and do behave in different ways, however unlike influenzas #COVID19 has no vaccine as yet and it‚Äôs seems to be more transmitted than seasonal influenza, nobody has prior immunity and the virus keep us new. Still there is a lot of unknown .
2660	202429	Never been more aware of my privilege than today. So grateful to receive my first coronavirus vaccine #docsforvax
2661	109307	@great_martis @AvidCommentator There has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus. People need to get the idea that we need a vaccine to save us out of thier heads. What happened to swine flu, bird flu, the plague? They aren't with us anymore. Preventative options and contact tracing are key. It'll be over soon.
2662	112352	Because Bill Gates prefers the trials with Africans over using animal testing.  And the African leadership makes them comply.  And they are the first ones to get the actual Covid vaccine when it comes out, as Melinda Gates stated.   They will be top priority.  Eugenics.
2663	110563	Hey...BLM...The Gates have so graciously decided you all get to be vaccinated first! What an honor!! The very people who want to depopulate the planet with the use of vaccines must really like you guys so much they think you should go first! Just a conspiracy theory, right?!
2664	108942	No vaccine in the 224-year history of immunology since Dr Edward Jenner developed the first smallpox vaccine has been developed under such an intense spotlight of media scrutiny as #covid19 vaccine candidates. Previous trials were paused too ... but nobody knew about it.
2665	110513	@porszag @StevenTDennis 1/COVID-19 has mutated into 30+ strains. There‚Äôs no way of knowing if a cure/vaccine is developed if it will work on all strains. Even if someone‚Äôs been infected with one strain there‚Äôs no way of knowing if the antibodies of one strain will protect from other strains. There‚Äôs no

2667	112898	Facebook is offering to add a covid-19 vaccine frame to my profile picture. How many magic internet points will I get for this?
2668	111435	Lost another family member to COVID yesterday. Then his wife, distraught and feeling tremendous guilt for telling him not to get a vaccine, took her own life‚Ä¶leaving their two kids behind. Will people PLEASE just get the shot??? #COVID19 #GET VACCINATED
2669	110459	Ok #Delco where are the vaccines? Was told the pharmacy didn't get any deliveries this week. WTAF is going on? We had appts, but alas no shots. #DelcoSucks #COVID19
2670	112483	So even once we all get the vaccine - by this time next year - doesn‚Äôt #covid19sk still persist, like a social condition, something to be avoided and never solved, like poverty, or like diabetes - manageable, but never in remission? This was simply #COVID19 Year Zero.
2671	108334	Watching @JustinTrudeau press conference - what is the obsession with the US and the response in the past. I, and my family and friends, want to know if a vaccine is being worked on? How close? What are the steps? Can we have money to pay for food and housing? #coronavirus

2676	109844	To anyone who says they will refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine I say fine, but then I DON'T think that I or anyone else has an obligation to make any sort of accommodation to keep YOU safe.
2677	110940	To be fair, Europe has it in abundance too.  It is just in the fridge as people don‚Äôt want it after the disgraceful scaremongering of Macron, vd Leyen et al.  #vaccine #eu
2678	110329	Exactly. If you‚Äôre not sick, you don‚Äôt have COVID. The vaccine companies understand this, why can‚Äôt  we get everyone else to?
2679	112653	This is America, I am working hard to stop the exportation of any vaccine raw material and our hearts go out to the Indian people. Well, on behalf on the Indians or any human beings that needs help.FUCK YOU USA! You are so fake!
2680	109881	@hellodumbass2 @carrieinparadi1 @faggo4you @RealCandaceO The mRNA vaccine was being developed for years. They only had to adapt it to the Covid-19 strain like they do with the flu shot every year. Don't take it if you don't want to. No one cares.
2681	202131	And the first Pfizer Coronavirus vaccine is in my arm! Thanks #aqueduct and the #nationalguard, the experience was seamless, safe and speedy! I got punched by a jockey, but he‚Äôs just cranky bc he can‚Äôt race horses right now. https://t.co/81Zl2TKzKQ
2682	110654	This makes sense! The vaccine is supposed to be there to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Though there is not much long term studies done, it is helping to try and get back to normalcy. #UNCWJourno
2683	109404	@ellymelly @rob__angeles @ScottMorrisonMP I told people I would never take the #coronavirus vaccine because it is rushed and they looked at me like I was crazy. I have no problems with taking vaccines but I'm not willing to be a Guinea pig for one
2684	109587	I got my second shot for the coronavirus vaccine my daughter got her second shot from the coronavirus vaccine yesterday and so far so good we both woke up feeling great thank God mind you in 38 years I have not have the flu shot my daughter 16 has not flu since 3 years old
2685	109723	History is being made. We can‚Äôt get complacent though. It‚Äôs going to be 6 weeks before just this lady is covered by the vaccine.
2686	109650	No origin! No vaccine! This bio virus has features of SARS, and other viruses. After 17years of SARS outbreak, not even one effective vaccine is found. Hydroxychloroquine is not perfect, but saves life! Take down Communist Party of China!
2687	107958	How many will flu kill this winter&amp; will must be separate from coronavirus. Professor Valance said coronavirus wont be eradicate with vaccine &amp; it‚Äôs likely to return each yr like flu. To me WHO is problem with coronavirus world wide.
2688	109508	@Matthews_angst If there are only certain vaccines in the world that everyone is being pushed to take against the COVID19 virus worldwide, then there is no such thing as variants.
2689	109439	@rudigr88 @NimblyBimbly420 @BluzPower @Keefito33 @Sally40613367 @paulanoukas you can get it from covid-19 as well, since viruses can cause it. The link to vaccines is just another excuse by anti-vaxers not to get the vaccine.
2690	110856	@alexbhturnbull It's all about the vaccine. Things will never go all the way back to life as we know it until there is a coronavirus vaccine. Until then we are just playing for time and coming up with workarounds.
2691	109492	Correct me if i‚Äôm wrong pero i think only pfizer is the only vaccine effective against the south african variant, a variant who‚Äôs not only more transmissible but more fatal. Pero pinupush talaga ng gobyerno ang gawang china ano.

2693	111772	Nobody will ever convince me that China didn't engineer the coronavirus as a weapon to be released into African countries to clear space for Chinese agricultural industrialization. They've been grabbing land for decades. It simply got out before they could engineer a vaccine.
2694	202040	I had my second dose Pfizer vaccine yesterday. Got at 2:15pm,  3:30pm start feeling weird at work. 6pm low fever &amp; fall sleep while in zoom class. Very unusual for me to fall sleep like that. This morning wake up with low grade fever, soar throat, muscle aches &amp; chills #COVID19

2697	112267	@peter_levy people need to wake up the covid vaccine is not a quick fix!! influenza and it's vaccine has been with us for decades and people have to have a flu vaccine every year the covid vaccine will be no different and coronavirus will never be eradicated
2698	109274	Only in the UK do 5 million asthmatics get told to be extremely careful and to minimise contact with everyone because they are more at risk of Covid19, then a week before their vaccine is due they get told they aren't getting it because not enough asthmatics have caught covid19

2709	201992	@9NewsAUS @Gabrielle_Boyle It's great news that at least everybody in NSW (Including myself and my carers at Parracare) have had at least one jab of a vaccine against COVID-19 however, there is still a long way to go before we can consider ourselves out of lockdown. I have my second jab on 9th Sept, 2021.
2710	112430	@MollyBeck @journalsentinel It is just plain selfish for 33 yo @AlexanderLasry to get the covid-19 vaccine shot. His excuse is unacceptable. Find a senior citizen. If you don't know any, then you're out of touch.
2711	108931	@nytimes We developed multiple vaccines for COVID-19, but there won't be one for #Trumpism. OTOH, it seems we did achieve herd immunity against Trumpism by Nov. 3, 2020, although many fools still refuse to accept the cure for that, just like many refuse to take the coronavirus vaccine.
2712	111112	Absolutely üëç They should!! Just like smoker's pay more!! But this is a serious mutant virus that will ONLY get worst if unvaxxed people continue this route..cut the corde to the variant..we all want a safe healthy life too..üëá

2719	112857	@ERtravelRN @NPGardener @BaddCompani My brother-in-law said he was sick (the worst he could remember) in January of 2020 so he believes he has already had Covid-19 and believes he is immune and therefore doesn't need a vaccine.  There is LOTS of bad thinking like this out here!

2723	110983	@PeterHu65796484 Paramount they get everyone vaccinated so they will be connected to the smart grid including children (important) so they're controlled in the future.

The vaccine provides no immunity whereas my immune system does.Corona viruses mutate hence its preferable to develop immunities as one ages.
2740	110789	the main downside of mRNA vaccines from the point of IP is the fact that once it is out (lipid formulation manufacturing process), it is out forever for any other indications too. It will be end of their exclusivity. So, they will not divulge it voluntarily.

2745	110814	People do realize they don't have to take the vaccine if they don't want, right? There's no reason to prevent those that do what the vaccine from getting it!
2746	202329	Feeling slightly under the weather on the second week after my last /final jab for #covid19 #Vaccination Actually, I feel slightly better today compared to two days ago. So, I hope I'm on the right track. üôèü§ûüòÜ#CovidVaccine #Pfizer @pfizer https://t.co/PsXIVYo0UX

2752	112859	Come on people how do you really know what they are putting into the arm of @Mike_Pence or @JoeBiden as they go on TV to make a big show of them getting a Coronavirus vaccine. It‚Äôs probably just saline. people are so gullible they will believe anything
2753	110315	@zacyoga @TimothyPSmith7 @rexzane1 It will be with us forever.  There's never been a vaccine against a coronavirus or the common cold. It is simply science. Just because a vaccine works on something else doesn't mean it will work on a coronavirus.
2754	110929	@AndrewFeinberg Does he seriously think we're all as ignorant and gullible as him?  He.  Did.  Nothing.  They have been working on coronavirus vaccines for years, and really upped the work after SARS.  That's why they make them so quickly.
2755	111724	@Baz4Ppc @FARIAMAL The existence of the new coronavirus has not been proven.It's definitely not a vaccine, as you can't make a vaccine against an unidentified virus.There are various types of existing coronaviruses, and even their vaccines, including SARS and MERS, do not exist.
2756	109790	@ryanlee609 @RationallySassy @JoshuaBeraldo Wanna know a fact. There have been 2 other coronavirus outbreaks in the last 18 years. Neither of them have a vaccine. SARS and MERS are part of the coronavirus family and you're telling me that infecting everyone will protect against the next coronavirus in 8 years?
2757	111191	of course, we are going to find a vaccine that will work 100% against #COVID19. This is what every country is wishing for (some are already making plans). I think no one has talked about plans in case no vaccine will be available. If I am wrong, please send examples?
2758	108136	eh, by a bunch of eugenicists that are trying to thin out persons NOT like them and to get their minions to assist ans stay in line - or else. yeah, it'll be done just like the eugenicists said they would - via the vaccine.

2762	112169	It absolutely flies all over that Bill Gates has the audacity to order everyone in the world to get a stupid Coronavirus vaccine which Fauci himself said may not work.
2763	112026	Why would i get the COVID-19 vaccine if it doesn‚Äôt stop me from getting COVID-19 or stop me from spreading it? and I will continue to have wear a mask even if I get it.... no thanks.
2764	108751	Swedish media is reporting that a vaccine for Covid-19 might be available already in September, the narrative went from 18 months to 5 months, I don¬¥t trust those energy vampires one bit, I aint having it in my body, rather take my chances
2765	202244	@CeeJaay761 Absolute insanity! Moderna, the NIAID, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also signed a Material Transfer Agreement for ‚ÄúmRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates‚Äù just two weeks prior to the emergence of COVID-19‚Ä¶ Coincidence?
2766	112759	"Let's stick to what we know: ""...not yet possible to say whether the administration of any vaccine would result in herd immunity in the population, because it was not known how effectively any of the COVID-19 vaccines would stop transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus."""
2767	108410	Your health is not my responsibility.I am not afraid of COVID-19I have the agency to make my own personal health decisions.The harder you push the vaccine on me, the more defiant I become.If you're worried go get the vaccine yourself, stop trying to control me.
2768	108064	"lotta people being like ""but it's a BRIBE!!!!"" yeah well if you had just gotten the (safe, effective) vaccine they wouldn't have to be bribing you"
2769	110780	People in my area are fighting with other people in grocery stores over wearing a mask. Coronavirus numbers continue to climb. A vaccine is coming but it's going to be a long time before the average person sees it.
2770	202072	So I wasn‚Äôt allowed to say anything until today, but I volunteered for the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer. The vaccine was developed in Russia. It‚Äôs in 6 different stages and I received my first dose this... MOAR....

2777	112310	I will surely take the #COVID19 #vaccine. I don‚Äôt believe with what the pessimists are saying about it. #AstraZeneca
2778	201914	My dad and sister got their COVID-19 vaccine today! I feel better about them going into the OR now. My dad changed his mind after he found out his brother, niece, and her two daughters tested positive this week.
2779	109939	Could open above 30k! What has been pointed out is that #Moderna vaccine DOES NOT HAVE to be kept in below zero freezer.
2780	112409	@realDonaldTrump People who already had Covid-19 symptomatically or asymptomatically probably don't need to take any vaccine, since they already have antibodies to the virus in their body.
2781	108369	This bears retweeting.  I lwas really hoping to spend some time outside with my regular friendsgiving peeps, but we aren't even going there.  In 8 months, vaccine permitting, we can party like it's 1999.

2783	109013	@BusinessLiveSA Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
2784	110047	Oh heck @SoniaPoulton you're mis-informed. Prof Sarah Gilbert has been working on a vaccine for a human coronavirus for over a decade. I don‚Äôt want to ridicule you but I‚Äôd urge you to do your research, you could stop someone having the vaccine with this sort of behaviour.
2785	112136	Put the COVID-19 vaccine in Diet Coke or Coke Zero and two things will happen. All these anti-vaxxers will be vaccinated, or they'll boycott and I won't have to drive to three different stores to get them, because these fools keep 10-15cs in their carts.#GetVaccinatedNow
2786	108601	just got my COVID 'My Vaccine pass', worked a treat, saved it using Google Pay, great system #MOH #COVID19
2787	110809	@MarineX @JD_Meadows @laurenboebert LOL. You can't compare statistics for the 1918 flu to the typical flu we have now. Again, a vaccine was developed for it in the 1950's.Actually Covid19 will compare pretty closely to that pandemic. The difference now is there are better health care systems all over the world.
2788	112053	My question it the anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists is this;If #Covid19 and by extension the vaccine is one big made up scenario, what is the end game?Give me a logical answer to that plz.
2789	110998	Just scheduled my appointment to get my 1st Moderna vaccine shot next week. They opened up the age eligibility range to 16 and older today here in PA. I can't believe I can get my Covid-19 shot that soon. #tuesdayvibe #COVID19
2790	109094	I found myself standing just inside the door of a restaurant yesterday to pick up my to go order, when I realized I'd forgotten to put on my mask. I didn't get panic-stricken though, because I've had my Covid-19 booster! I did get my ass outta there as fast as possible though. üòä
2791	110790	Hypothetical question:If you had to choose between being intentionally infected with the coronavirus or taking an mRNA vaccine, what would you choose?
2792	110376	@RichardBulling9 @nanbgood @latimes Yep. We‚Äôve never made a coronavirus vaccine, and the one they tried to make for SARS-Cov1 ended up killing the animal subjects. The virus burned itself out before they finished. It‚Äôs unlikely this one will do that. Ive been fretting since january!!
2793	109876	Why is @JoeBiden ignoring the vaccine? Is Joe crazy? What is all this garbage? 1st masks don't work, then they do &amp; now only work with 2 masks. But China Joe apparently thinks none of this works. I guess @JoeBiden rejects science after all.
2794	109383	It fascinates me the inverse logic of these ü§°. It like using alligator repellent in the bathroom and claiming it saves lives. It‚Äôs a cold type virus. Everyone gets them and there‚Äôs never been a workable vaccine for common colds.
2795	112060	@NHSuk The NHS is lying. The truth will surface. #stayhome¬† is so you don‚Äôt find out their hospitals are empty. They abused care homes. This health service is evil. Do not by any means take the vaccine. There are no #NHSheroes, #coronavirus is a hoax not a conspiracy.
2796	108284	"As per the script. They'll just start calling it flu when a ""vaxxed"" person has it , ""covid"" when they aren't contaminated with experimental gene therapy passed off as a ""vaccine""."
2797	110778	I can't wait to get my COVID19 vaccine.I'm a little concerned how I will personally handle the vaccine. When I got my flu vaccine in 2020 I got a temp of 104.7.That's just me.Please people just take it.
2798	108081	Legit question for my followers. @RepJayapal tested positive for #COVID19 from reckless actions by her Republican colleagues. But didn‚Äôt she get the vaccine?  Can someone please help me with this. I‚Äôm for the vaccine but this just came to my mind and I‚Äôm curious.
2799	112285	This isn‚Äôt that surprising and honestly if this becomes like an annual flu vaccine it will normalize getting the shot and maybe more people will be willing to do it.
2800	111907	The pandemic in South Africa right now is not Coronavirus. Petrol prices are going up astronomically tonight which would affect the price of bread, transport, and basic items but our leaders have decided to listen to the UN, WEF, WHO to mandate a vaccine that does not work
2801	108498	Everyone is panicking over this vaccine and posting irrational and fake news on it. Listen to the ACTUAL FACTS. Get the vaccine or don't, but either way please shut up about it. I don't know about y'all, but I'm over this pina colada we are in and I'm tired of distancing #COVID19
2802	201974	Excited for my friends with younger kids to feel the same overwhelming relief I did when my adult children were vaccinated last spring. Where and when Johnson County kids ages 5 to 11 can get Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine https://t.co/i7fb4KbZdt
2803	110543	So the #FDA approved #Phizer #VACCINE, I still wont get it, not enough study done on it, not one person will say how the vaccine reacts with your DNA, my doctor told me I‚Äôve had Covid and I have the antibodies no need for the vaccine, don‚Äôt forget #COVID19 actually has a nucleus https://t.co/3i9e7D4duM
2804	107781	You all can can the bullshit now. The vaccine doesnt work, has deadly side effects. You guys are pushisg it too hard. Give it up its a money maker for you guys.

2806	109158	No, no! This isn‚Äôt happening!!! NO. Not them too. Take the ones who refuse the vaccine, if anyone at all, not those who are naive &amp; innocent, please.

2813	110012	@IamRubberYerGlu @PattyHajdu So what group do you feel are the experts then. The W.H.O ?  The U.N ? Bill Gates ? Fauci ? Are you gonna get in line for the Covid-19 Vaccine. I'm not sure if I am aware of any group of experts that are going the same direction. Please enlighten me so I can do some research.

2817	107722	@duggo11 @DrAnneMurphy @ciananbrennan @morningireland There is ongoing trials and now real world data too, and if there was none complete they will still be getting the vaccine, I have seeing the effects the common cold has on my child and covid19 will be detrimental to them if the catch it!
2818	107784	So what you want me to believe is that coincidently while they developed the Covid vaccine it just so happens that a second dose and a booster of the same vaccine will work on the original coronavirus? Is that what you think I‚Äôm going to believe?
2819	109017	@moes_taverne @Yetta_HH @NDRinfo @ndr They shouldn't even be receiving the jab if they've had coronavirus within a month prior.If they already have it, then they need to let that pass, wait a month, then receive the vaccine. If you vaccinate while someone is already infected, it will not work as intended.
2820	109898	@beebdeaxoru yikes, my parents aren‚Äôt anti vaxx but ik some parents who are. omg how does she feel about the coronavirus vaccine?
2821	109885	If you get the vaccine you‚Äôre highly unlikely to get Covid, BUT if you do, you won‚Äôt show symptoms, BUT if you do they are likely to be mild, BUT if they aren‚Äôt you aren‚Äôt likely to be hospitalized, BUT if you are you won‚Äôt die, BUT if you do‚Ä¶ sorry Charlie
2822	108495	So Canada has just approved clinical trials for a Coronavirus vaccine developed by a Chinese biotechnology company. The new (or same old) Steve Jobs business model: if there‚Äôs no need for your product, create a need then offer your product as the only viable solution

2840	110977	@SUNYUFS @uupinfo  Can we vote on a faculty vaccine mandate!  I think a majority of faculty would vote for a faculty vaccine mandate.  We want safe working conditions.  So if you're really representing faculty interests, why not put it to a vote?
2841	111327	We need an Apollo-type program with public-private partnerships to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine AND a universal flu vaccine. It would take 2 major pandemic threats off the table.
2842	107776	@BuckSexton Here is the one suggestion We can all agree on.The Covid-19 vaccine should be tested on our politicians, MSM, and professional athletes first!If they survive, it is safe.If they don‚Äôt, We are safe!!!
2843	109591	So what happens when vulnerable people have had their #COVID19 vaccine? Will they be expecting to mix with others as if the risk had disappeared for everyone? They still pose an infection risk and this needs to be made clearer, surely? @MattHancock @doctorshaib @drphilhammond
2844	109004	@chrisyeem Thanks very much CJ. I guess this winter will be harsh for Covid19 spread. So after Christmas when it's warmer and safer is probably best to take the vaccine.
2845	111398	The notion that Covid19 Vaccines were developed to fight humanity is utterly wrong and cannot be verified.Do you think we'll all be alive and well if the previous vaccines we received where developed to work against us?Please be wise! Go get a jab.

Are antivaxers going to take a vaccine for a virus ü¶† that‚Äôs fake and can‚Äôt hurt you?ü§® I don‚Äôt get it???
2861	107713	We can‚Äôt do this to our health care workers. They‚Äôve already endured unimaginable tragedy. Get. The. Damn. #Vaccine!
2862	110714	Data after data shows the covid vaccine is very effective against severe hospitalizations and death.. If you can make sure to get vaccinated. With numbers like this i still dont know why folks are not prioritizing the vaccine over other unproven treatments #TwitteRx

2864	107943	Vaccines are nice, but it still doesn‚Äôt stop long-term effects and spread. We still need to care for ourselves, which in turn, takes care of one another. Do your part, please.
2865	111180	My grandmother was born in 1945. She told me that when the Polio vaccine came out in the 50s they lined her and other kids up at schools to get it. Unless you had a medical or religious exemption you had to get the shot.You lived through this too Joe.It‚Äôs not hard.
2866	112742	Let‚Äôs assume that what they would take is actually the vaccine. Pretty easy to have saline. Didn‚Äôt Barack stage swimming in the gulf while they were covering up the deep horizon oil spill...
2867	108503	@cmosl101 @larsp2740 @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I agree numbers are worse, clearly due to reopening efforts and human behavior (please, everyone wear a mask!). But we are still ‚Äòflat‚Äô compared to original estimates. Would you agree the Coronavirus will be around just like the flu? A vaccine will not stop or eradicate only slow
2868	110440	Dumb idea I might actually do: If you're taking a coronavirus vaccine, buy far OTM puts on the stock of the maker. That way you're partially hedged if there are some bad long-term effects to the vaccine (the lawsuits will probably kill the makers).

2896	110775	Ang nakakatakot dito, we're trying to paint a picture that a vaccine will be readily available this year when it's in the early stages of human testing? With the entire world needing the vaccine, where and how will we be able to pay for the vaccine? Exclude private ulit?
2897	110495	No one has stated anything about a person already having the COVID-19 and survived with anti-bodies, no one addressed that they would be tested for COVID first before insisting on vaccine or those who have anti-bodies!
2898	201937	My experience not getting a COVID-19 vaccine, at age 36 around February of 2020 I got COVID-19 and most of the symptoms moderate to severe level. I never got tested for COVID-19, but I'm sure I already had COVID-19 and probably all of the variants.  #DeltaVariant

2929	109888	@DoniTheDon_ Delta is only mandating coronavirus tests for its ‚Äúunvaccinated‚Äù workers. If you‚Äôre going to mandate testing, I truly do not understand why you wouldn‚Äôt test your entire workforce (the vaxxed and unvaxxed). The vaxxed can get infected and spread the virus too. Totally weird.
2930	111239	@JoeBiden You're a FUCKING IDIOT. The @potus does NOT approve a vaccine. A #coronavirus vaccine will be approved like ANY OTHER vaccine or drug. YOU ARE CAUSING PANIC AND DOUBT in a vaccine when it becomes available. YOU ARE A FUCKING WASTE!#HarrisBiden @TheFive #TheFive
2931	108047	@darakass The Covid-19 ‚ÄúVaccines‚Äù (which they are only therapeutics, not actual vaccines) do not stop infection or spread. Neither quarantines nor masks stopped or greatly slowed the spread. If we want to get back to normal, just get back to normal, without trying to stop nature.

We already know you don‚Äôt become immune without a vaccine, how would it irreparably damaged their long term immunity? Are you suggesting letting children catch it? It‚Äôs not chicken pox. Leave it to the experts.
2974	112470	All he had to do is just get the fucking vaccine. The positive news is, nobody really ever catches anything from Cousins when the #Vikings try to make a playoff run.
2975	112133	@MichaelGershon5 @Mssarahmssarah @NYCMayor @DOEChancellor @NYCHealthCommr Masks are not protection, people with Covid-19 think if they wear a mask they won't spread it. My 92 yo Dad died from Covid-19 before vaccine. In a locked down nursing home, all wearing masks. He got it from his masked caretaker. He wasn't the only one, it spread like wildfire.
2976	112373	So let me get this right, some peeps wont take Covid-19 vaccine because they dont know what‚Äôs in it or because of a so called chip in it, but would happily carry mobile phones around and eat whatever Mcdonald‚Äôs dishes out to them? Hilarious this aint! üò©ü•∫

2978	107683	@rmkaymusic @bunker_pod @NinaDSchick @Dorianlynskey @sturdyAlex People have died because we don't have an effective treatment for coronavirus, not because they were waiting for a vaccine.
2979	112908	@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I have never got a flu vaccine and I never get the flu. I haven't got the Covid19 virus that I know of..

2982	110487	How is this going to work? Who gets the vaccine and how will there be enough? Do we even trust a vaccine developed this quickly? I hope proper testing occurs.
2983	109195	No one: Absolutely no one: My dad: What if aliens came to earth with a vaccine for coronavirus but in exchange for it they ask that we give up Australia
2984	112839	Why does someone who had COVID19 and show positive anti-bodies have to get the Covid vaccine? It's stupid. It's like giving the chickenpox vaccine when they show positive antibodies!@RonJohnsonWI @SenateGOP @SenateDems
2985	108252	It truly is a gift- I‚Äôm in the phase 3 Pfizer trial and still not sure if I had the real vaccine or not- I think I did due to the strong effects after mr second shot !
2986	108534	@out_th3re @ConservUSA38 @AP You obviously aren‚Äôt very intelligent, there is no stopping this. Have we stopped the flu after decades? Coronavirus is here to stay even with a vaccine. Shutting down the country will cripple the economy to no return. It would take decades to recover from another shutdown
2987	108086	This is a good analysis. Consumer confidence will likely be low as long as immediate testing and a verified vaccine are in place.
2988	109957	@AWokeZombie Not sure if this is a vaccine death or not. But it really has to be fully investigated. And if parents are reluctant to get their children vaxxed because of this uncertainty, I cannot disagree.

2996	112197	@SenSchumer One big question and problem is until a vaccine is found on almost a worldwide basis. What can we do. As if the airports and borders are open and people from all over the world are flying and going everywhere. The coronavirus will still be spreading....

3007	201910	I wonder how me (21) and my sister (26) didn't get Covid 19, when our parents (M58, F59) did (father got it twice). We both use birth control pills (Diane). All of us got vaccinated, but before vaccines were in Turkey they got Covid 19. #Covid19 #Pandemic
3008	109147	We not only need a Coronavirus vaccine, we need a MAGAT vaccine. It needs to stop the ongoing spread of lies and corruption
3009	111986	So you mean to tell me that the immune system I‚Äôve been building for over 20 years doesn‚Äôt work anymore because I stayed inside for two months?? After I done had all your little vaccines and shots? I‚Äôm not going for it.
3010	110558	@ReutersUK Thanks, but no thanks. Not interested in taking a rushed through vaccine. I'd rather stick to my vitamins and zinc, and a good routine to keep me safe as it has done so since covid-19 started.

3028	108628	@britneyxmariah Why wouldn't they trust the vaccine?The COVID vaccine is just a different version of the SARS Coronavirus vaccine that has existed for years. The only thing that's different about the COVID vaccine is which protein is included in the vaccine. Other than (1/2)

3041	112916	@CamJunior1972 @ChrisCuomo vaccines prevent you from infection because it trains your immune system to fight the specific virus.

3099	111711	"Lol Politicians getting ""the vaccine"" in public. Don't even know where to start with this. I mean, I know they're stupid/careless/trusting enough to do it, but why would any conspiracy theorist believe it weren't saline? 90% of what the elite does at this point is lazy handwaving"
3100	202002	I had my first jab last week (Ox-AZ)! In &amp; out under 15 min, then a 15 min wait post-jab before driving - couldn't have been easier or better organized.  Didn't even feel the actual jab, no side-effects aside from a slightly achy arm &amp; mild headache. Very happy! @NHS @UniofOxford
3101	109586	I just got my first COVID19 vaccine! 1 year into a devastating pandemic and the human world is (largely) coming together to fight this common foe. Please sign up for your vaccine shot, wash hands, distance, and mask, all signs of respect for each other. ‚ù§Ô∏è
3102	112725	just read this whole thread - spooky in its implications - amazing work!  Only ? I may have is there any difference in vaccines used and do they follow the 2 shot protocol va Ontario and I am now pondering what the hell is going to happen when Ontario starts 2nd shot in 4 no
3103	108958	@ShaunaLeas @Gmant055 @washingtonpost A mass vaccination strategy against an airborne coronavirus in the midst of a pandemic with a leaky untested vaccine is a very bad vaccine use case.

3108	112554	going out on a bleak limb and officially predicting a certain someone is going to take credit for this vaccine (which will not work) in order to get votes from dipshits and then the dictatorship REALLY kicks off

3114	109002	What's the point?Testing results enable contact tracing and inform those who definitely need to isolate.  Without rapid testing, cases will increase until there is herd immunity (70% or more of population infected) or until there is an effective vaccine.

3116	110923	They also have ZERO liability on any vaccine they produce. Major conflict of interest as they have no financial risk of making a dangerous product. Yet the sheep will flock to it. Ill take my chances with eating right, working out, and building up my immune system.

3135	108873	This is why no one trusts this govt. Who are these sources? Who is on the panel? What is happening considering till a few days ago, consensus was that one should get jab after rapid antigen test which showed level of antibodies. Just say you dont have vaccines, dont make up stuff
3136	111146	I‚Äôm not surprised....if only the rest of Kansas could get with the program. Spreading awareness and education on the vaccine helps.

3138	112488	@AldoAvina Been people in America getting reinfected. The flu is a version of coronavirus so why do we believe a vaccine will be 100% effective. Is it more realistic that developing better treatments is the way to go?
3139	201933	@MamaTealRose @bigdaddyd2008 @MoodyMegsy @10NewsFirst Morrison need not worry because he took the Pfizer vaccine already.It have preferred if the healthcare worker in the Brisbane hospital that got infected with covid19 (revealed last night) had received his dose. #ScottyTheLiar #ScottyFromGreed thought he needed to have it first.
3140	110746	As far as I'm concerned,  THROW THEM ALL OUT! Gates and the depopulate earth have got their kill vaccine motion. IT CAUSES STERILITY AND MISCARRIAGES! How better to depopulate the world! DO NOT GET THE VACCINE! It is also killing about 20%of elderly!

3142	110032	@lemondrops42 I‚Äôve only seen Dems call it the Biden vaccine to troll Trumpers calling it the Trump vaccine &amp;/or giving Trump ALL the credit.

3145	110970	@mdnij34 A mask will protect you even after the coronavirus is under control , but remember this vaccine is not a cure , and the experts don't know how long this vaccine will protect us from the virus that is mutating. This vaccine is in the testing stage .

3152	112148	@aurorabennu @CSaulnierHfx Then you clearly dont understand what science is. Science is the study of information. Humans can be biased but science isn't. As for the scientists that developed the vaccines. Their work wasn't sloppy and this isn't the first coronavirus vaccine to exist
3153	108203	After the election.They've also been conditioned to think that a vaccine will be their savior, despite the fact that no coronavirus has had a vaccine.
3154	108988	@CloydRivers Folks liking this acting like they weren‚Äôt saying the COVID-19 vaccine wasn‚Äôt FDA approved and therefore they couldn‚Äôt trust it. So do you want the government‚Äôs oversight or not??? Lmao

3161	108469	@Goat_Jump_Ranch @_lorieeee @disclosetv Natural immunity from the original strain of COVID-19 is WAY better than the vaccine. If you‚Äôve already caught covid once then you don‚Äôt need to get vaccinated. EVIDENCE has shown you‚Äôre more likely to catch it a second time if you get the vaccine. Don‚Äôt go by what the say!
3162	112104	It's looking less and less likely that there will ever be a vaccine for covid-19 so is @T_Deeney never going to play football again?
3163	111298	Wonder what the real answer they want to track and trace Black, Indigenous and elderly.  Couldn't pay me to take that vaccine if Gates has any part of it!
3164	112469	They stopped offering Covid19 vaccines anywhere in my area because most everyone is so old that they were eligible months ago. Now I am eligible and can't get one. I knew I was going to fall into a crack. I'm going to have to wait for herd immunity.‚òπÔ∏è

3170	108499	@AnnastaciaMP Remember coronavirus isn't Covid-19, the testing can't distinguish between influenza A or B, let alone Covid-19. But they hope you don't realise this because it blows the lid off their illusion to push the vaccine!
3171	111558	To leave unjabbed frontline workers in position over the winter period when the system is most stretched and then to sack them in the spring proves that these are really punishment sackings for not obeying Government orders. If they were a real danger, they would be removed now.

3183	109498	Actually the scientists all said they don‚Äôt know if the vaccines will work on the current strain. Studies are being carried out. What they said is if a vaccine was available they would take it irrespective. But since we have access to only a handful of doses it‚Äôs largely academic

3195	112864	Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that doesnt have a vaccine. instead of not getting it (ala when u get a flu shot) some ppl will get it &amp; difficulty getting over it. Healthier ppl will get it, get over it, &amp; move on. It‚Äôs the inundation of treating the sick that‚Äôll be annoying
3196	112381	It only applies to Canadian citizens, it's weeks away, and you may still have to quarantine at home. So the government's line is: Vaccines work, but only if you got 'em in Canada. Non-citizens, meanwhile, are an existential threat.It's just bonkers. It makes zero sense.
3197	111029	Why? It doesn't make sense when they have said the vaccine doesn't prevent getting infected or it  spreading, only the seriousness once infected. So therefore it wouldn't make any difference ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3198	109998	Why is anyone getting a vaccine? I‚Äôm vaccinated because they said do your part, u can‚Äôt travel protect yourself  etc. I got sick after second shot. I will not be risking my health for a booster that does nothing to protect me or anyone else. Vaccines only benefit those selling it

3201	109751	The U.S. needs to ship out the remaining vaccines now. If the idiots anti-vaxxers don't want it, stop wasting it and get it to people who do.
3202	112446	The question is why did US start to develop vaccine if they haven't had any case in US or if China hasn't shared the gene sequences with world yet . Can't you get your lies straight? #COVID19
3203	109830	@J_Effing_B @Dmack2407 @EthanStarr45 Because living a healthy lifestyle &amp; building your body's immune system will do more to protect you from a virus than an untested vaccine when I had covid19 back in July I quarantined but I also jogged &amp; walked around my yard to strengthen my lungs.

Then when they do get one, it still has to be administered, &amp; we know how well that‚Äôll go with you at the helm!
3205	109590	The French govt sends their jackbooted stormtroopers to disperse the masses protesting a stupid fucking idea. Like that's gonna encourage them to get the jab. Get pissed. Cos it won't be long before it happens in your area...
3206	110519	@ewarren I heard got #COVID19 even with so-called #vaccine.  Huh, another one shows #vaccines don't work.
3207	108096	Hey @krispykremeUK can we get this over here? Or is it a US only thing? I've had my first covid vaccine and I love Krispy Kreme üòÄüíû
3208	112641	You are Part of the Great Vaccine ExperimentNot every American will want to take the new Coronavirus vaccine once it has been approved.¬† But there are many who have already stepped up to take the vaccines that will help to determine if and when the rest of us should.
3209	112305	If the new COVID vaccine is free, and it‚Äôs not patented, then it will alleviate a lot of the civil unrest happening now. People will stop dying and getting ill from Covid. No BBQAnon rallies. Families can hopefully safely go back to work. And the learning gap will slow down.
3210	108551	@MontagueTerrie @RayUngerer Do you, or your ageing parents take the flu jab annually??It‚Äôs a virus, it mutates‚Ä¶. Annually.Covid-19 is a virus, it too will mutate‚Ä¶. Annually.
3211	108641	As I recall, and I may be wrong, when the Polio vaccines came out there was NO charge for them.  My concern is the price Big Pharma could charge for the vaccine as they already do for most drugs. Jus' sayin.
3212	112129	"@JimMFelton I CANNOT WAIT for the advertising campaign where this lot roll up their sleeves up, look directly into the camera and say their catchphrases, but all Corona-y. ""I'm getting the vaccine because my doctor's got an -ology""""Coronavirus! You are the weakest link, goodbye"""
3213	202226	What a fantastic experience today getting my first #COVID19 vaccine injection at The Royal Hampshire County Hospital üè• Clear signage, great instructions both verbal and written just a great system from start to finish üëèüèª üëèüèª #Pfizervaccine #COVID19Vaccine https://t.co/wTs4JbvifH
3214	111547	@wagsSC The vaccine doesn't stop the virus. It reduces the symptoms. The virus is called SARS-Cov-2The vaccine deals with COVID-19 which is the symptoms not the virus
3215	107960	@RichardGrenell @TwitterSupport Rachel, why are you spreading misinformation about COVID19?  The vaccine does not stop it.  You can still get Covid and infect others even if you‚Äôre vaccinated.  Now stop or we will have to report you to Twitter. Just kidding. We know they don‚Äôt care what YOU say.
3216	111614	@tr6pilot @BuckSexton He was. The novel coronavirus is not an influenza virus.Flu vaccines are not mandated.
3217	109513	@miffed_slightly @DebbieL59701084 @delbigtree Like I said, go ahead and be the first to take the coronavirus vaccine, oh you might of taken one with the flu shot. This one will be special though, I don‚Äôt want to bore you with the details. I‚Äôll let you look into how bill gates and, WHO, NIH, NIAID are connected to eugenics.
3218	110511	. #Moderna says #COVID19  vaccine 94.5% effective.Good news.But vaccines cant put an end to a pandemic just like that.So keep those masks on please
3219	110316	@BorisJohnson No need for lockdowns, masks or vaccines if you actually ran the country like a properly run businessIt's not our job to protect the NHS, it is yours to make sure it is fit for purposeThe buck stops with you BOJO #TheUKisAMess
3220	112346	There will never be a coronavirus vaccine.The Coronavirus family are RNA viruses and mutate like wild.By the time you brew a vaccine, it will be a completely different strain.Thanks China!
3221	111203	@cziriak_ I'm actually feeling like death warmed over upon waking up this morning. Received my second and final moderna covid-19 vaccine yesterday and although yesterday I felt super great... Today I feel just the total opposite... üòê
3222	112686	How stupid do the red hat anti maskers have to b to1. Think the vaccine contains live coronavirus 2. The vaccine keeps them fr being exposed to the virusThe vaccine ISNT A FORCEFIELD. You will be exposed to the virus, and your body will easily fend it off bc of the vaccine!
3223	108699	Good now people will hopefully shut up about ‚Äúit‚Äôs not an approved vaccine, it‚Äôs only emergency use, I won‚Äôt be a SHEEP‚ÄùThey probably won‚Äôt‚Ä¶.but god I hope.I‚Äôm sure most of my followers are vaccinated but if you‚Äôre not please please please get the shot üíâ
3224	112568	I know this is a high plateau but it‚Äôs working! The US will get this under control. Because, well, loads of money and vaccines. Which we may not have - however, we do have the reassurance that the vaccines seem to be helping with reducing spread. That‚Äôs enough for me to hope
3225	109297	This is the NHS Chief Midwife, urging pregnant women to get the jab, even though we DO NOT have the data to say this jab is safe!! @TeamCMidO - we would formally like to invite you for an interview to defend your stance. Could you kindly get in touch please? üëç PLEASE SHARE! üëäüî•
3226	109074	@tweettruth2me Antibody Dependent Enhancement. It‚Äôs been the fate of all prior Human Coronavirus vaccines (trialed in mice/ferrets, not humanity). Wrecked cellular Immunity, coupled with the shots still being coded to the Wuhan strain. I am worried for my vaccinated friends and loved ones üòû
3227	110954	@Nick_Pye If it ever ends üò° and aren‚Äôt they protected by the Coronavirus Law ü§î. Just like they will be with the vaccine üò°
3228	111185	Remember when Right Wing religious extremists would go around murdering abortion doctors for Jesus? Well, those same people believe that the coronavirus vaccine will kill everyone who gets it...
3229	108993	@YahooFinance @denitsa_tsekova Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.

3231	111336	@bluebug1954 @GovSisolak No thanks to everything you said. You‚Äôre welcome to get an experimental vaccine, I‚Äôm happy it exists for the elderly, but the young and healthy don‚Äôt need it. Especially not those of us who already had Coronavirus.
3232	201826	Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday took the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at Delhi Heart and Lung Institute here.His wife also took the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine here. https://t.co/cVcp49xjHs
3233	109977	@axios Not surprising. GOP are virus sceptical so don‚Äôt take precautions, which leads to getting infected. How many more times will we see this? How many times will they open up too soon and let COVID-19 run wild? Add in vaccine hesitancy and it could take a long time to get rid of.
3234	109240	@IsaacMadengu @thehill He's very much connected with Anthony Fauci, who is making the vaccine push here. And many outlets do recognize Gates as a leading figure in the international Coronavirus response.
3235	108689	@DrEricDing I am sorry, but He is not a Doctor. So He should not have a say on what is needed! Only the Doctors that have made this vaccine know how many shots will bring a person 95% coverage from #COVID19!
3236	108114	Happy News: just made an appointment for my 90-year old mom to receive the coronavirus vaccine! So excited!!! ü§ó
3237	108983	@Jgfleet661 @DemocracysBrnr @NBCNews The next coronavirus will be novel, but they will have a head start on a vaccine because of what they learned this time. Talk today was of a pan corona vaccine that addresses some more basic trait the family has in common. It may need to be tweaked each season like influenza vax.
3238	108853	People really think they‚Äôre gonna get a vaccine for COVID19 and it‚Äôll all be over with ü•± this is our new normal,  you can‚Äôt completely eradicate a virus
3239	111034	Please get vaccinated if you are eligible. Our great teamwork is our only way out #CovidVaccine #COVID19Aus
3240	111795	"@BigDaddyLiberty That profile is the kinda idiot who STILL doesnt know masks do nothing to protect against Coronavirus.And that profile believes so intensely in its satanism,it is threatening employers they'll""meet their makers""if they oppose the misnomer #MarchToSaveLives for vaccines that kill"
3241	109187	I mean we all want to return back to normal. But you can‚Äôt say that vaccine is proven safe. I won‚Äôt be apart of taking that. Plus I‚Äôve had COVID-19 before and am younger, so I feel my body will fight it easier and have built up immunity for it. We need to look after the elderly.
3242	112664	When they develop a coronavirus vaccine -will the anti vaxxers use it? Or do they just oppose some vaccines
3243	109006	I know Coronavirus panic is being used to try and put the boot on our necks, but what if it makes people realize they need to be a little more self-reliant in an uncertain world?  I'm hopeful that 55% of New Yorkers wouldn't take an experimental vaccine,
3244	112528	I don't even want it around like the flu. Wish people of today were smarter about vaccinating. üòîüòîüòî Vaccines are the reasons we don't worry about polio, tuberculosis, the flu, measles, and so on. Maybe we won't even worry about cancer &amp; HIV w their own emerging vaccines soon.
3245	201810	I just got the COVID-19 booster shot. Let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôll feel like I just woke up from a seizure again like the second shot. Seriously, that shit hurt.
3246	111205	"To COVID-19 antivaxxers: The government already put  microchips in everyone (&amp; has continued to do so on newborns) when the ""Freedom Act"" was put into law after 9/11. They don't need to waste money on implanting ANOTHER microchip in you with the COVID-19 vaccine..DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
3247	108747	So great to hear the Moderna vaccine is 94.5% effective against coronavirus. Any good news is so welcomed. But our reliance on getting this information through a press release without seeing data needs to change.
3248	107952	Title: Asymmetric information and its influence on the distribution of the Covid-19 Vaccine. Meaning: no one is gonna go get it.
3249	202021	My spring break summary:- 923 tweets sent- 8 virtues signaled- 2 masks worn (one over the other)And I got my COVID-19 vaccine. I forgot to announce on Twitter that I received my vaccine, but thought I would let every one know that I got one, because I‚Äôm a teacher.
3250	108017	So they know not only that there will be another #pandemic, but also that it will be a #coronavirus again. Interesting.Thinking faceYou can bet that if they actually do come up with such magical #vaccine that it will be basically mandatory - even moreso than the jab for covid.
3251	107883	If it is true my beloved government will steal the vaccine and sell it to our neighbors then vaccinate us water ( fake)
3252	109221	Great for us. But American exceptionalism is dying.   The problem with this is that poverty stricken countries cannot afford any vaccine and there wont be any left for them. Covid-19 is world wide. Its even in Antarctica. The WORLD needs vaccine. @JoeBiden
3253	112455	@TheSiuloir @Dr2NisreenAlwan @jeremycorbyn So would you approve ‚Äòunvaccinated HCW(because they don‚Äôt believe in the vaccines) vaccinating patients with covid19 vaxes?.
3254	110184	@elonmusk Why not Tesla get into producing vaccines for masses in poor countries against Viruses such as coronavirus
3255	108084	@itvnews If the ‚Äòvaccine‚Äô doesn‚Äôt stop transmission, you‚Äôve had #covid19 and recovered, why the hell would you waste a vaccine rather than protect someone else?!? This is the most absurd statement so far. Absolute rubbish.
3256	110098	If there is no cure or vaccine for the old common cold coronavirus why would there be one for this newest coronavirus?
3257	108465	This election is lost. Declare it a fraud, move to state legislators appointing the electors.  Take next 2 years to work on a true fair system, cost not object. implement it and test it, like moon shot, or covid19 vaccine priority. All chips on the table. This is it.

3260	111295	@ZLoescher @rauzersg1 @9NEWS What a bizarre response. It‚Äôs not as if doctor Fauci is the only expert supportive of vaccines. The vast majority of them are. Covid is a novel virus. That means it‚Äôs new. And we‚Äôve never had a vaccine for a Coronavirus before.  The rest is just an odd series of deflections.
3261	112760	Thank you @ReneeMerrifiel3 for bringing attention to this. It is too late for my grandmother, but many elderly will not receive vaccines for months. They deserve all the resources we can provide.
3262	110583	The liberals are having a talk about the importance of working together during covid while they are in charge of the only country in the world where they didn‚Äôt work together and thus have Canadians rationing vaccines!
3263	110591	My hunch is that a lot of EU expats got their #vaccination in their home countries, like me (though I then got my GP in Brussels to register my jabs in the Belgian system)
3264	108346	I‚Äôm going to get my COVID Shots soon but I need to take my time with that. It‚Äôs fairly obvious that vaccines work but not all the time, which is why you take your time getting them. I became very sick and more autistic from vaccines but the stabilized versions do work.
3265	109785	Well if distancing and masks are still needed then the vaccine obviously doesn‚Äôt work!                          And if virus doesn‚Äôt stimulate immunity then the vaccine won‚Äôt work!
3266	111700	@timacheson @MaizyDaizyZzzz There goes getting COVID-19 under control  Especially with those South American numbers I bet they get the vaccine before US citizens like they have done in the UK  Yes Britain has the same problem and liberals suggesting mainland Europe is not safe for immediate
3267	110321	@thelionrawrson @Conserve321 @GovAndyBeshear Science will tell you that children don't get sick from coronavirus. Science will also tell you the vaccine does not stop the spread it just lessens the symptoms. If kids don't generally have symptoms what is the vaccine for?
3268	111708	@Abba_Annabelle @funder Between fighting Covid-19 and ignorance, it is easier to get the vaccine since it is very difficult to talk to an ignorant person.
3269	112544	How to convince a conservative to get the vaccine:What? You want me to pay for YOUR ICU bed because you didn't take PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY and get vaccinated? You are so ENTITLED #cdnpoli #antivaxxers #covid19 #CovidIsNotOver
3270	108387	@johnthefocuser @j88KBF @zev_dr The vaccine renders the coronavirus a non issue. It‚Äôs for the greater good to have it. Please do when the time comes.
3271	107882	Or until you decide to give up your power, which everyone with a brain knows you never will.This is not about the vaccine, this is about control.
3272	112610	@heatherschatz @WJCTNews Thanks for work on this.My two-bits --&gt; If no definitive vaccine in 2020 for #covid19, we would be best using resources to help restaurant workers transition to things we need today.
3273	112563	@2000Nhgt @brad224 @JoyceWhiteVance All my loved ones are vaxxed. If I had young children, I would rarely go out‚Äîand would go NOWHERE w/o absolute precautions. I worked too hard to get my kids and would die for them w/o a second thought, #COVID19 #FullyVaccinated
3274	109409	Say no to Chinese vaccines. China hasn't explained how they let coronavirus get out of control. They lied from the beginning. Now they want us to take their vaccines üò´
3275	110621	Layering and masking up with my quarantine buddy to go stand in line for a vaccine. I live in one of the zip codes and qualify under the 1B criteria. I really hope that when we get there, the line is obnoxiously long bc folks are wanting to get vaccinated.
3276	108691	Covid-19  I just cannot take the governments seriously, not while they are still allowing anybody to fly all over the world, I am not getting any more vaccinations until they stop toying with us, they wont trust the vaccines, neither will I.

3278	107984	If we are healthy then world will be healthy he says. Pandemic has no cure or vaccine says @narendramodi Keep away from crowds and maintain social distancing. It is v necessary to practice as it will play a big role in combating this pandemic
3279	110462	@DrMadej I am a Korean. He has one son and he is a Christian.. I don't have faith in vaccines either. I hate vaccines. The distrust of covid19 vaccines in particular is very big.
3280	110080	Ethically &amp; morally the right decision.  Especially if the US already has enough supplies. I'll actually think we need to be proactively working with health institution to make sure vaccines gets to everyone. This action is a form of leadership and a lesson about our character
3281	111678	Lol what? You've been keeping morale of the populace up by telling everyone the vaccine was the answer, and life would return to normal. Well, now we have the vaccine, and you're telling us the pandemic still isn't over and to still follow all the precautions?? Get bent.
3282	109571	I'm so glad I don't have to deal with the possibility of being at school for üó£Ô∏è IN-PERSON CLASSES IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WHILE THERE IS NO VACCINE OUT YET. üó£Ô∏èI'd nope tf out if I found out someone I shared a classroom with got coronavirus.Risking myself &amp; family is not the move.
3283	110946	actually that's not so accurate.. we can get infected again with other strains because the virus is always mutating, and mutating very fast. That's why Moderna started on making improved vaccine for #COVID21 group. In Aug 2020 already 29 #COVID19 strains were found in Malaysia
3284	109672	"@BrexitStewart  We trusted a dodgy ""Scientific model"" which has proven to be dramatically flawed. Yet we are pressing ahead with a vaccine, why? There is plenty of evidence to the contrary, which states a vaccine is not needed. Who decides if we need the vaccine?"
3285	108173	It could be a blessing in disguise. More opportunities will come my way. My greatest achievement was getting into the University of Edinburgh Law School. I am very proud. Sadly, I think I have to defer until next year when there is a COVID-19 vaccine.
3286	110243	"The ""no way we have a vaccine this year"" to 2.1 million vaccines initiated in first 2 weeks of rollout and extrapolating that out years ahead is an interesting new narrative."
3287	202296	Not wanting an untested vaccine in my, or my family‚Äôs, body is now ‚Äúextremist‚Äù.  If this doesn‚Äôt dissuade you from this vaccine, nothing will.
3288	110362	@GiuseppeConteIT @robersperanza Several scholars have been raising warning flags about this imminent possibility in respect to the coronavirus vaccines aggressively being rolled-out, particularly the Bill Gates-backed Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

3293	112484	@UBI4UandI @EricTopol The #COVID19 #vaccine is free for all Americans.What is going on @US_FDA defies simple explanation. But we should all ask why @POTUS hasn't named an FDA Commissioner. Leadership matters, especially in a #pandemic .
3294	110290	@laurenmill3r93 It doesn't change the fact its a human experimentation, hacking our bodies, never before this synthetic DNA or RNA has been tested on humans. There has been already many deaths reported but clearly they died cuz of covid19 and not this so called vaccine.
3295	108800	@RichieAllenShow My main problem with the vaccine- if they haven't yet tested for a virus, but genetic material, then the virus can't possibly be what they say it is. SO- what exactly are they trying to force on people?? What is in that syringe? #StopTheNonsense  #COVID19 #KBF

3302	108396	@atrupar What does he even know about the coronavirus vaccine? Someone should ask him. It sounds like in order for the vaccine to be effective, a person would need two doses of the vaccine for it to be effective. So like a vaccine and then a booster?

3304	110203	@CobbSchools great news!If you‚Äôre serious about ‚Äúencouraging vaccination‚Äù, it‚Äôs time to set up vaccine clinics, like many other metro school districts have done. Make it easy for parents to get their kids vaxxed, making school safer for everyone. No time to waste‚¨áÔ∏è

3307	110551	The government has had since December 31st 2019 to come up with a plan for us in multiple scenarios, what are they actually doing, this thing aint going away and a vaccine is not arriving tomorrow
3308	202232	PM @narendramodi Ji got the first  dose of Covid-19 vaccine this morning.

3309	111652	Sorry for the barrage of negative news but I truly don't think many people understand what we are dealing with here.  I'm praying for a vaccine so we can get our lives back to normal.
3310	108328	@OregonGovBrown @OHAOregon What on earth did you think was going to happen? Oregonians will not stand for your tyranny any longer. If vaccines work, why are you shutting down? This is the WRONG way to motivate people to get vaccinated. You are out of touch with reality.
3311	110863	@ann_eann @MrStevenCree @caitrionambalfe Exactly. My understanding is that you may still get exposed to COVID-19 but the vaccine lessens the severity of the symptoms. Ultimately, isn‚Äôt that what it‚Äôs all about? Not overwhelming the hospitals when they have a limited number of ICU beds, ventilators and staff to run them?
3312	108483	"Unfortunately, yes.  You cannot take the Mark of the Beast. Staying away from the vaccine is critical. Please DO NOT get vaccinated. It is not a vaccine at all. This is a deception to capture souls while the world chants ""COVID"" or ""DIVOC"" and evil spirits latch on to the Godless"
3313	109148	Boorah for @realDonaldTrump - We do not want to follow a corrupt organization like the WHO! They are heavily influenced by the Communist Chinese Party! They want to force the world to take vaccines &amp; that is NOT possible! Too much unrest to get it done!
3314	108034	I worked in a research lab in a hospital and went to a patient floor ONCE A WEEK. I had to have antibody testing, get vaccines I didn't already have, and have boosters for others.If I didn't - NO JOB!If you don't believe in science why work in health care?üò°
3315	111322	This is excellent. Every teacher who feels uncomfortable in the classroom should be offered a vaccine now so that we can get school back in person, five days a week, ASAP.

3320	109597	Vaccines vs variants. This is an example of why I rant like I do about vaccines not getting into arms fast enough, it literally is a race. Whether the vaccines are effective against this variant is unknown, but so far they have been effective against others.
3321	112073	Covid-19 vaccines are like prayers. Even if you commit 100%, you still need to do everything like a person who commits 0% for them to work.

3324	112094	@tburages I am so sorry @tburages. Truly. This is devastating. You are pro-#vaccine, and now struggling w this death in your family. An idiosyncratic reaction to anything like a vaccine or a medicine is possible. Yet on a global scale the vaccine is saving millions of lives. Seeüëá
3325	107762	@matthewjdowd üíØ% Precisely.Besides, Coronavirus Vaccine has been in the process for nearly ten years.
3326	111240	My mum (62y) has tested positive with Covid-19 for the first time after getting vaccinated by four days, would I blame on vaccine for weakening her immune system or thank vaccine for bearing this disease.
3327	108921	@matthewstoller Theres never been an effective coronavirus vaccine for humans. Maybe this will be the 1st...
3328	109810	Listen folks, I am triple vaxxed, my whole family besides my 3 year-old too. I am fairly left in my politics. But this is bullshit and such a slippery slope.
3329	109237	@GeoffRBennett @maggieNYT TRUMP COULD PASS A VACCINE TODAY FOR VOTES üá∑üá∫ BUT PROBLEM IS THE VACCINE'S GOTTA WORK AND TRUMP CAN'T BURN OUT COVID19 LIKE PUTIN JUST DID.. #SNAKEOIL @PTPGOfficial @IntlCrimCourt @HouseJudiciary @allontheline @ICCT_TheHague
3330	110528	My wife is a rheumatologist and has a masters in epidemiology. She tried to enroll our kids in the vaccine trials. That didn't pan out so we'll have to settle for as soon as they're eligible.
3331	108656	COVID-19 vaccine #AZD1222 showed robust immune responses in all participants in Phase I/II trial. #AstraZeneca is not making any profit on this. üá¨üáßüá∏üá™
3332	108909	the two questions:why is this vaccine different from all other vaccines?why in all other pandemics do we act like normal humans but in this pandemic, we act like idiots?
3333	110305	So the Moderna Vaccine is 95% effective against COVID. These companies like to play it safe so chances are it‚Äôs 110% effective. Soon as it drop, I need y‚Äôall to line up for it like y‚Äôall did the PS5. Take the vaccine and stfu about Corona and masks and social distancing. Thx
3334	108901	@Trinhnomics Why would anyone under 70 take or need a vaccine not to mention an mRNA any mention big ADE coronavirus??? Humans so much to learn... Wake the hell up
3335	111556	There are lots of reasons not to want to get a #covid19 vaccine.But none of them are any good.#VaccinesWork
3336	109707	@genesimmons @FoREVer_A_BAT and @jerogan  If everyone got the vaccine they wouldn't have to worry about getting or spreading the virus. If they were to get the covid-19 virus and they had been vaccinated, their case would be very mild or asymptomatic.
3337	202351	This'll take 5 minutes of your time if you track üëåüèæ (I religiously track mine as my migraines fall in line with my cycle!) - my cycle length changed after my first vaccine &amp; my first worry was impact on my migraines! This is important research for many reasons...
3338	112102	@HoarseWisperer Actually, some good news on the vaccine front with Moderna, with rumors saying more good news later this week on the Oxford vaccine. It would be destiney if on the day Biden takes office, multiple companies announce Covid-19 vaccines. Hey, we can all dream, right?!?
3339	109610	@karlamarie171 @aubrey_huff I don't know if you are or not. It sounded like you weren't going to get either of the covid19 vaccines. Did I misunderstand you?

3423	110703	My bigger concerning is that nobody knows how long the vaccine last effective, not even CDC. If this is something we have to get every 6months or less, there's going to be huge delay of plan bc then whoever categorized in high risk group needs their second shot around summer.

3442	108539	"@SarahD31523908 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump If you take the gamble then that is your choice. There is no treatment on the mass market, no vaccine, one day COVID19 with have a cure and we can go back to normal but until then you have a duty to yourself to reduce risk. If you don't,  you can't then say ""its not my fault"""
3443	108662	Interesting , don‚Äôt think üá¨üáß is  doing any post vaccine testing?We should, it‚Äôs important monitoring data
3444	109134	We need to be on the lookout for an effective foreign-made #coronavirus #COVID19 #vaccine because this administration would 100% suppress the news if it competes with an American company that #Trump has investments in
3445	112649	@for_seagazer @_EMazing @emmy_angelle Yeah, the problem with vaccines in the past is they rarely got any attention or funding.  Hell, there was a vaccine in the works for I think MERS, which is another Coronavirus and it got it's funding pulled because politicians didn't think it was worth the time or money.  Idiots.
3446	109770	My only opinion on the vaccine is this: I got one shot Sunday &amp; I‚Äôll get another May 2nd. I‚Äôve got people close to me who have contracted Covid-19 &amp; suffered &amp; people in my house with immunity issues so I‚Äôm going the safer than sorry route &amp; I‚Äôm 100% confident in my decision.
3447	109370	@FRANK_SINATRA7 @Breaking911 All the shots are booster shots. If one is vaccinated they would have sterlization immunity. They would not pass on or get sick from the virus. Hence reality is there is no vaccine for this virus. Highly unlikely there will be a vaccine for a coronavirus anytime soon if ever.
3448	202108	As of yesterday, 56.5% of the UK's population have had  one Covid-19 vaccine dose and 33% have had both doses. An incredible achievement.
3449	112388	People getting outraged by this.. Vaccines don't make you immune, just makes you more resistant to the infection.COVID-19 isn't going away, just like the flu.
3450	107976	get'er done folks. Let's go beach whaling! Would u like to join me? Tons of food, sun, camaraderie and fun, but if you like to be trim, jogging on the shore or swimming will keep u healthier!#CoronavirusPandemic #VaccinesSaveLives
3451	107905	Face it right now - if we do not inaugurate #PresidentJoeBiden Jan 2021, we have NO WAY through this. Would you take a vaccine touted by this admin? Would u ever give it to your children - (no trials being done on children yet?) Honestly, I would not. #JoeBiden2020 is our hope!
3452	110275	Hold on. #immune45 may figure out a way to make a buck from coronavirus and get involved big time. A fake vaccine?
3453	111276	1.1 Billion people across the continent need the mechanism to get vaccines. Until we all come together to make sure they get it we're never going to get rid of COVID.
3454	109064	@mynameisme91 Thank you! He‚Äôs the MAN!This virus has a bunch of mutation, which helps in getting to a universal coronavirus vaccine, but can sometimes be catastrophic.He just relieved so much anxiety.
3455	111197	@aznananc @JesseUno @TulsiGabbard The vaccine is meant to prevent serious illness. If the elderly do get it, they don‚Äôt get sick. The vaccine does not prevent COVID-19 from spreading.
3456	111448	Fort Detrick has the vaccine. (They had already been injecting soldiers with MERS vaccine in Summer 2019).
3457	109628	I work in health policy, am immunosuppressed. I‚Äôve had my first #CovidVaccine, can‚Äôt wait for my second and my 4 year old child will be vaccinated as soon as a vaccine is approved for his age because #VaccinesWork #cdnpoli
3458	108631	Like any epidemic, there are still only three options to keep it under an epidemic threshold1. Indefinite lockdown2. A vaccine3. Enough immunity
3459	110710	To be absolutely clear: Get the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as you can. It is right the experts are investigating, but almost certainly there is no real issue here, and even if there is an issue, we know it's very rare. The risk of getting Covid-19 and dying is worse.
3460	110937	This is sad. I‚Äôve been rooting for all the vaccines. I‚Äôll be shocked if it gets approved here in the US...
3461	109313	@Altxk @tariqtramboo You should get one serologic(antibody) test done cuz according to CDC, If someone who has had COVID-19 recently wants to take the vaccine, then ideally, that person should do so anytime between one to three months after symptom resolution, following infection with SARS-.CoV-2
3462	108230	If we pay attention  to people like @BDUTT  we give them importance .yeh l trend ke bhooke h..bas dhayan dena band kar do. they are worse then coronavirus ,corna does have a vaccine in future but people like this dont #barkha repeat #sushant was not bipolar #UddhavResignOrCBI4SSR

3468	109316	This is why myself and my family won‚Äôt be having this vaccine. We‚Äôve managed perfectly well without it all this time, and it‚Äôs not going to give us our freedom back anyhow. No thanks @BorisJohnson
3469	108743	This is why anyone with a half-functioning brain knows the thing about a widely-distributed, effective vaccine in the next couple of months is... well... bullshit
3470	108103	I I think getting a vaccine developed is a good idea ‚Äì vaccines have saved a lot of lives and this is a very weird virus we can‚Äôt hide out for three years.  I‚Äôll take them back soon because I want to see my grandma!
3471	108142	Since so many red-staters don‚Äôt want their vaccines, why can‚Äôt those of who may need a booster just take theirs right now?
3472	111829	I'm confused. As far as I am aware these vaccines do not prevent acquiring OR spreading the virus.The conflicting information is troubling to me which is why I'm waiting and NOT getting a vaccine.Media, medical, and government need to pick a lane #ldnont @fordnation @WHO
3473	112241	From what I'm reading, it looks like the coronavirus vaccine process is going to be in multiple waves over the course of years. The first vaccines will only give temporary immunity and the population will have to be revaccinated every few months or every year.
3474	109485	So it looks like people are going to be forced to get the covid-19 vaccine if they want to go to college or keep certain jobs, it seems like none of the representatives in office are doing anything to stop it.
3475	108407	#unitedstates, please get vaccinated. The #vaccine is 95% immune to #coronavirus . Every #american can be 95% immune to #COVID if we all work together
3476	111767	I can‚Äôt imagine how are the Americans allowing this lunatic out in the open. Even a tyrant Putin is vociferously against vaccine mandate but the gold standard of democracy has resorted to coercion and force! Shameful

3479	109340	@EmaGabrielaS @IngrahamAngle The premise here is completely wrong. We know the flu has a shelf life, and we have new vaccines for it every year.This is a NOVEL CORONAVIRUS. That means we have never seen it before and that we have no immunity to it. Also we still don't know how well survivors will get along.
3480	108714	I find it frustrating that people didn‚Äôt get the vaccine UNTIL it affected them personally. Not doing it out of wanting to protect everyone around them and themselves, but until they were affected.
3481	112746	this most likely will be what ppl will get every year, like the flu vaccine. new boosters for variants. this vaccine is still in ‚Äútrial stage‚Äù and they don‚Äôt wanna admit it
3482	107893	We need to make the #CovidVaccine mandatory.  Those that don‚Äôt want to take can move to #Detroit , can‚Äôt fuck that place up.  They can then play the herd immunity game with each other.  Once #COVID is gone they can return to society.  ##COVID19

3485	107815	@TheAnswerer1 they may be. no vaccine is going to work against a coronavirus. that's why they have new ones each year for new strains. that and the $$ it generates. And of course, if JJ sees everyone else getting paid on the booster train, they are jumping on board.
3486	109809	Allowing #Covid19 to spread uncontrolled across US is just prolonging the pandemic. And we are creating perfect conditions for a worse variant to be created that will evade the vaccine even further.It feels like US is on suicide mission and taking whole world down with us.
3487	107998	Why are people tweeting about the covid vaccine with ‚ÄúJUSTSAYNO‚Äù included in their tweetsOh right, they‚Äôre idiots who think Covid-19 is a lie. I forgot.
3488	112167	I still wear my mask inside places. It doesn't take much for me to do that for other people.We know vaccines only help ourselves, that's what all vaccines do, they protect the person who gets the jab but we still have to stop the virus from spreading.
3489	110037	@FCN2go Ya.. this is how they SECRETLY give you this so called vaccine for the Covid19. Plus whatever else they have in mind or up their sleeves.

3494	110638	So what if we don't get a viable vaccine or medication in the immediate future and it takes 2, 5, 10 years? Or worse, we never get one.
3495	108251	We‚Äôve had a vaccine for a good 6 months now?I can‚Äôt &amp; won‚Äôt have any sympathy for them anymore. If they‚Äôd rather listen to an ex reality tv actor, twice impeached *president than DOCTORS &amp; SCIENTISTS, may God have mercy on their soulü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

3504	108292	@Astartiel @JustMarilyn7 @KitterleCathy My concern is considering this is a coronavirus (the same kind that are common colds) that they won‚Äôt be able to make a vaccine that is effective. We don‚Äôt have them for common cold coronaviruses. I am hopefully, for good treatment options though.
3505	109433	Yeah, but it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs vaccine rollout that violates muh freedumb, so we certainly won‚Äôt get vaccinated. Plus, having a national healthcare system is socialism. So I guess we‚Äôll just have to get sick pay for it out of pocket.Makes sense, don‚Äôt it?*Sarcasm*
3506	107830	@thegriffin666 @RichardDawkins Since you are some kind of expertise in this field. Do you think that it is likely, that the world‚Äôs population of humans get vaccinated. Before the vaccines available will be outdated, due to new Covid-19 mutations. Like the common flu virus?

3560	111194	@NolteNC Never had a flu shot, why would I get this shot?What's the long term tested results of this covid-19 vaccine?Get back to me in 10 years with the results.K bye.
3561	109353	While the vaccine may take some time to arrive in the market, we need to be aware and take the necessary precautions. Just a reminder. .#spreadpositivitynotpanic #Covid19 #Precautions #Prevention #CoronaVirus #WearMasks #NoMaskOff
3562	110759	Great article explaining how herd immunity is truly only effective with a #vaccine - otherwise hundreds of thousands more people will need to die before the #Covid_19 #pandemic ends. Herd immunity is perfect for diseases like #rabies #Measles #polio. #VaccinesWork
3563	108557	@EricTopol We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
3564	108254	Until there is a vaccine I do not understand the decision to open up schools, it's a disaster waiting to happen #COVID19

3566	110437	@futurepundit This coronavirus is similar to SARS so it may be that developing a vaccine will be similarly challenging. It may be that some of the horrible reactions in Wuhan are similar immune system overreactions and not inherently due to the virus itself. (This is seen in dengue too.)
3567	109330	@szn_holiday It‚Äôs almost like we don‚Äôt already know a lot about coronavirus strands and have a vaccine for sarsü§î
3568	109201	If these folks give us free vaccines as donations,do you think they will allow us to manufacture our own Covid19 generic vaccines  in Africa?
3569	108025	While this is all great news. There still will be loss of life till then. Im everyone working on these vaccines are doing their very best to help save us all. I thank each and everyone you these people.
3570	108269	After all I‚Äôve been getting my Flu Shot there for free for the last 5 years. Thanks to OBAMACARE!! Trump is now trying to take credit for this? Also don‚Äôt trust a COVID-19 vaccine!!! #CancelWalgreens
3571	202104	Took my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against COVID-19. https://t.co/9539rdC6fQ
3572	109262	I couldn't believe what I was reading. This is my state. There is no way in hell I'd take any vaccine for covid. I don't take any of them.
3573	202185	NEW: Ontario is proceeding with second dose administration of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, beginning with those who received their first dose between March 10-19, 20211/2
3574	108501	A vaccine is unlikely. The virus will evolve and mutate.The population needs regular exposure to develop T-Cell immunity.It's beyond control and elimination.Get back to normal. Use vaccines against the worst strains, and target the vulnerable.You know, like flu.#COVID19
3575	201930	Got my first covid shot on Wednesday.  Yesterday I had muscle pains and fatigue, along with arm soreness. Would I do this again? Absolutely! This temporary discomfort is nothing compared to getting Covid-19.  Do you have concerns about the vaccine? #CovidVaccine #COVID19 https://t.co/DSnQhWg6J3
3576	111870	What if coronavirus is a laboratory engineered virus and the Gov't made a deal with China to let them in to hasten the spread of the virus and in return loot what they get from the portion once the Chinese start selling vaccines #coronavirusInkenya
3577	111998	The flu pandemic lasted for two yrs and they never found a cure why you think they give you the flu shot. This coronavirus pandemic is gonna last for two yrs they making a vaccine because there is no cure
3578	109649	I‚Äôm definitely going to say I got the vaccine if this is true.I‚Äôm just being as truthful as they were.#CovidVaccine
3579	109109	*sigh* And here goes the first.(I know it doesn‚Äôt mean the end for this vaccine but not looking good).This is why vaccine research usually takes years, and why I don‚Äôt keep my hopes up. Failure in vaccine research is part of the process.
3580	112088	#DrFauci has lost my trust. He now tells America, there will be a #Vaccine by the end of the year. On whom will they test this Vaccine, prisoners? Formerly, Fauci said a suitable Vaccine would take between18-24mths to know if it works. Has Dr. Fauci fallen foul of #GOPCorruption?
3581	112429	Will we eventually reach #HerdImmunity when the #antivaxxers either die or create their own antibodies? #CovidVaccine
3582	112904	Yes... if my slippery snow covered sidewalk, that belongs to the city can get me sued if a person is injured... then not much of a stretch for Covid spreading when vaccines are available.
3583	110461	@maestramarney I'm so very sorry for your loss. Because of the Trumptards scientists are starting to say that covid-19 in all four phases is most likely going to be with us forever. I suspect until they find something like the pneumonia vaccine we will probably have to get a shot every year
3584	108323	Wimbledon provides a platform to nationally recognise great work where it is deserved, incl. NHS, carers and AstraZeneca vaccine scientists.I'm so glad AZ/vaccine developers were included. Well done @Wimbledon
3585	112279	NO....you don't get to do this....countries all over the world are working on a vaccine...We have people in our countries that are going hungry....No more...CDH
3586	201884	My father got his first AstraZeneca Covid19 vaccine shot in Delhi today. Succeeded after 2 attempts to book a slot, 2 system reboots while waiting and 1 correction to how his name was spelt. Failed at taking a photo though ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
3587	112489	‚ÄúI never get sick. I don‚Äôt need the vaccine.‚Äù1. You can still be asymptomatic and spread #COVID19 to others.2. You can still give the #coronavirus a chance to mutate into a more virulent strain.
3588	108962	And if the vaccine works those who take it will be immune to the virus. No reason to worry about me who doesn‚Äôt want to take a vaccine. Right? So there‚Äôs no reason to mandate everyone taking it just those who, ‚Äúwant to live‚Äù. At least according to THEM!
3589	110401	#bbcbreakfast What do you mean it's not yoghurt?What the hell have I been growing in my fridge if it's not a coronavirus vaccine?
3590	108822	They have coronavirus vaccine but it's for the elite. they'll start threatening us that we can get the vaccine if we agree for the microchip. This is how they're going to control ppl. Dont call doctors dont contact ppl. Stay healthy as long as possible üñ§ #WhyImNotVotingForTrump
3591	111562	eventually, if the vaccine does not work, or the virus learns to mutate, this virus might triumph over Homo sapiens...
3592	108295	#COVID19 #COVID19vaccine @DFisman Seems fighting a pandemic is a 100% participant sport, there is no 100% participation, Xmas politician holidays confirmed it will never be! so , instead of fining, why not just move the non compliant to end of the vaccine line?
3593	112644	@daveretiired @goal I just went to receive the COVID-19 vaccine today but when I went sign the confirmation for it I couldn‚Äôt find any pens to sign with! It was really strange! I checked my security footage and saw that Penaldo had taken all my pens! I‚Äôm still shaking. Curse you Penaldo!!!
3594	110957	Remember, you are not alone on this world; give a stranger a hug, the coronavirus vaccine will be out soon
3595	110117	Dejavu of last spring ~ Cannot believe how SLOW the vaccine rollout has been in Canada. So disappointed that our government (one of the ‚Äòbest‚Äô countries in the world for health care) did not order enough vaccines ahead of time, it is MAY in one week!??@AndreaHorwath @CP24
3596	109326	I'm sure the monkey's lead scientists stole the samples after they realized that humans are taking too long develop a vaccine.
3597	109952	Dad is now signed up in a dozen different spots for the #COVID19 vaccine.He's 77, and has COPD. It *is* his turn; I just need a health org or department somewhere to realize that.In other news, you may now refer to me by my new job title: CEO of Paternal Vaccine Procurement.
3598	107904	MAYBE if we showed the head honcho of @WHO the HORRIBLE things happening@around the world, and then have them say that they've found the #coronavirus vaccine, THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD'T GO INTO F*CKING CHAOS!!!!!
3599	112611	I get a flu jag every year. If I need a covid jag every year too I'll take it. I get my 2nd Astra Zeneca jag in just under 4 weeks. I don't know if they've said anything about future vaccination boosters
3600	112614	This is so great. I'm going to have all my vaccine information tattooed on my body in case I lose my card--but where?
3601	111349	Yeah then they‚Äôre gonna tell you the vaccine only makes you immune for 6 months and you need a booster
3602	110996	@andrew_lilico @dumbrill We don't. It can't be done without a vaccine. There isn't one. Yet.That has always been the fundamental flaw in the 'herd immunity' thesis. It was based on plans for a flu pandemic. A coronavirus isn't influenza.
3603	108049	The #CLOTSHOTS aren't vaccines! Please don't just take my word for it! Do the research! Don't take what anyone says at face value..especially the government &amp; particularly not the people that are going to make a lot of money out of what they're telling you to do!!.eg..Big Pharma!
3604	107704	@GandBLawyers The Victorian government are lying about test numbers? The question is why? And the answer is to keep this fraud called covid going until a vaccine arrives. Then most will jump at the vaccine to go back to normal &amp; those who don‚Äôt take it will be persecuted.
3605	111840	I am never taking this vaccine for sure. If anyone isn‚Äôt providing trial data and publishing them, they can‚Äôt be trusted.
3606	202118	I was fine after first two shots of Pfizer #COVID19 vaccine... but the Moderna booster absolutely wrecked me.
3607	109030	If there's a vaccine for Covid-19 made in less than a year. Why hasn't a vaccine been developed for Cancer?
3608	108841	@dobermankahn @Tennscarlett1 @Richard63052724 @CanalZone66 @poeticpotion111 If you get the vaccine you are safer than if you didn't take it.But if you think it's smart to get covid-19 to be even safer then you are dumb af. You can die from it and pass it out to others!
3609	110350	Y‚Äôall are killing me. So the virus is gonna end by us all collectively staying on lockdown... forever? And not the government using this time to create a vaccine and tests for immunity? America is trying to patent the vaccine before it‚Äôs even been made whi-#Day13 #StayHome
3610	112749	I don't want a vaccine!!! That there could or will be a vaccine for #COVID19 is a ruse 4 something all 2gether. Many sticky fingers in the COVID pie! COVID=VIRUS &amp; as such, it's constantly mutating! That's why there's no vaccine for the common cold, which btw, is a COVID virus!

3619	111174	@zanaturalhealth @rcr_pereira @geoffreyyork @MarianneThamm The purpose of not going for ‚Äòherd immunity‚Äô is that there is more time to find a cure. The concept of herd immunity in the absence of a vaccine just means everyone gets sick - it is not a cure. For Covid19 80% need to become infected and then immune. How is that good news?
3620	108848	"Is there data on how long immunity from COVID lasts once a vaccine has been administered? The ""post-vaccine"" hype is getting out in front of what the reality may be."
3621	109461	@NJKMcG @gaelmcl @Aintropy @BorisJohnson So what good with a vaccine do, if it mutates and changes so quickly? And I'm quite sure there is just one strain of COVID-19, hence why all the vaccines are focusing on COVID19. So How can Boris get the virus again if he's already got the white blood cells or t-cell immunity?
3622	109264	You blew flu vaccine. Does that mean you're due to get one right like the blind squirrel finding a chestnut?
3623	107708	I used this exact rubric to figure out whether I should get #COVID19 or not, and it convinced me to get the vaccine. BTW, being vaccinated *can* stop you from getting and spreading #COVID, but just like every other form of medicine, results are not 100% guaranteed.
3624	111037	I'm getting my regular flu shot over the weekend. I'm a huge supporter of vaccines.BUT there is no way in hell that I'll get a Trump COVID-19 vaccine that has not been tested properly. Is this Trump's attempt to kill more people before the election? #COVID19 #vaccine
3625	109252	@DinerOpinion @CobbIslandCrab @GeorgetownJD @blockbasher22 @BuckSexton Not even the point.

3627	109488	@ShroomMonarch @ShariFreeWill @Gray_Mackenzie No vaccine is 100% at preventing transmission or infection. They work really great when everyone who can get vaccinated gets one. Kids spread COVID-19 to other people. Mitigation strategies are not just about their safety.
3628	112680	The question no one is asking...will the #COVID19 vaccine be free? If not, will it be affordable for EVERYONE?
3629	111162	Trump lying again! There‚Äôs not a chance in hell there will a vaccine available in a couple of weeks! The drug companies r still going through their trials! They will not release a vaccine that may harm people because they r afraid of the lawsuits that would be coming there way!

3632	108852	@CDCgov Natural immunity is good. No one wants to get Covid19 but vaccines aren't stopping break through cases. So if you've already been infected why would you need a vaccine for protection when you already have protection?
3633	112271	Today I had my first dose of #COVID19 vaccine. I got emotional. In one year we rapidly developed and produced millions of vaccines. I fear for what‚Äôs next,  being a COVID-accelerated financial crisis or an even deadlier pandemic.

3642	112260	The IOC flopped on an opportunity to lead a global vaccine campaign with WHO or something. Even with a global vaccine shortage, the IOC has to be corrupt enough to get vaccines for every Olympian headed to Japan
3643	111639	@Oregonian I am all for vaccines as they are proven safe, and often the side effects are little compared to what the vaccine is for. I even get flu shots and stay healthy. As long as a Covid-19 vaccines was properly tested as other vaccines, I would get one.
3644	108784	The only Project Fear is the one against masks, all based on anecdotal evidence like 'an imaginary friend of an imaginary friend had to sit down for a minute after wearing a mask to go and buy cigarettes - that proves Bill Gates is trying to murder us with an untested vaccine'.

3668	109824	@ChicalinaT @delterrykilgore I agree there will be a time we need to get back to pre virus life. That time is when everyone can be tested for COVID-19 or there is a vaccine for the virus. That is when life will return to normal.

3676	110914	@timspector Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but is there any link between Covid-19 vaccines preventing the onset of hayfever symptoms ? Normally my hayfever kicks in strongly mid-May, but this year I haven‚Äôt had any symptoms (yet)
3677	108419	@Mivi_Official I think covid-19 vaccine will arrive first than refund for my order no. 090802698. It's been two months since I have returned the product and continuous follow up for refund but there's no support from customer care. Didn't expect this from MIVI.
3678	110407	"@backinghostform The whole COVID-19 was apparently man-made, and also the vaccine Bill Gates wants to ""test"" in Africa is going to turn black people into some kind of zombies, their going to monitor everything we think, they'll install micro chips into our brains through the vaccine"
3679	110027	Still want to send your kids to school in person??? You may want to rethink this while there is no vaccine available for them. #GoBacktoELearningAndKeepYourChildrenSafe #DeltaVariant #COVID19
3680	107700	@drvolts My vaccine may not protect me against the next COVID-19 variant. #1. I selfishly want others to be vaccinated. #2 I don't want to see others suffer needlessly.
3681	109629	Give it to Bill Gates first. In fact give him all the vaccines first. If he don't died, get cancer or a third tail in 5 years maybe then the study will be safe, No?
3682	112158	@sciam Current vaccine is yet to be so stable and the mutations of the virus may possibly make this vaccine useless in coming days..My best guess, this story will end up as seasonal flu vaccine wherein we will have to take covid19 vaccine every 6 months/year.
3683	111712	@AndyBiotech $AZN has never been a vaccine company before now and Oxford University is a... well, an academic institution.Realizing that, chances of producing a safe vaccine that prevents coronavirus infections in all comers anyone?
3684	111033	‚û°  Multiple SLU faculty will add their expertise to our epidemiology, communications and geospatial work. It will help us research and plan for an eventual COVID-19 vaccine. And it will allow us to use SLU‚Äôs COVID-19 app for symptom tracking and contact tracing.
3685	109760	To everyone without a COVID19 vaccine either by choice or not, I sincerely wish you good luck and hope you do not get exposed to this nasty, nasty virus.
3686	112439	So looks like I‚Äôll be participating in the #COVID19 vaccine trial. They just need to clear my odd reaction to the HPV vaccine from 10+ years ago, but once they do I‚Äôll be setting up my first appointment to get microchipped, I mean my first injection.
3687	112307	They can authorize all the emergency Covid vaccines they want you‚Äôre not FDS approved you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre putting into your body and if you think it‚Äôs safe not me
3688	112944	Somehow we've managed to invent and deploy an entire new vaccine technology in this time but can't figure out which of dozens of existing antivirals will work against a coronavirus.
3689	108753	Truth &amp; facts scare Hehr Fraudci. He's all about helping make deadly viruses &amp; vaccines that don't work. I guess they do work when population control is the objective. 5 yrs. in prison is not enough.
3690	110365	@cachobweeney I think if 25% of the pop. gets immunized by next spring it will be a miracle. All those whining about masks = tyranny now, there is no way in hell they would agree to EVER being injected with a #COVID19 vaccine.You know - the Bill Gates, George Soros, contrails crowd...
3691	112843	@JustinTrudeau What about all the Canadians who are high risk and can‚Äôt get the current vaccine because we are on immune suppressant drugs? We are being told we can‚Äôt get the current vaccine and we want it #covid19 where do Canadians with compromised immune systems go for funding and a vaccine?
3692	111359	It's proved that HIV is treatable, Ca is a different subject it's not a virus u can't compare a virus to a disease &amp; not all illnesses are fought the same way. Also so what if they came up with a vaccine in this short time interval? Covid is clearly more contagious and urgent atm
3693	109298	Such a sad story. Anyone else feel like you're screwed either way? Take the vaccine and risk whatever adverse effects it has, don't, and risk this?
3694	109145	@VOAChinese What happened? China has announced that novel coronavirus vaccine is available free of charge to all people in China.
3695	108185	"Something I like about the ""don't take vaccine because you don't know long term effects"" folks is that they never mention long term effects of COVID."
3696	110633	When we have a coronavirus vaccine, the federal government will start to give the vaccine to elderly Americans first, then to everyone else, hopefully free.
3697	108787	@JeffVeillette Great except that won't work as I got my Hep A and other vaccines. Not getting the COVID-19 vaccine. It is experimental and no long term data on it.
3698	108794	They still haven‚Äôt got a vaccine for SARS (a coronavirus), and that was 18 years ago, now these morons expect us to believe they can conjure up an entirely new sage/tested vaccine, for an entirely new virus within a year. I know you think we‚Äôre all thick, but we‚Äôre not..
3699	108177	Why aren't the vaccines working to stop the spread? The UK is a highly vaxxed country. They going to try and blame it all on the unvaxxed there too?
3700	109346	There has never been a successful #mRNA vaccine in human history.There has never been a successful vaccine for human #coronavirus in human history. Correct? Every attempt at both has failed, right?

3704	108391	Lock it down till atleast 2022..... We're going to do this just wait for a vaccine dance until people finally decide life's to short to not fully live it.
3705	108996	Not even one day. This seems to indicate that parents sent this kid to school while awaiting a test result. This is exactly what teachers and parents fear will happen. This is why schools should remain closed until therapeutics or a vaccine is developed.
3706	108732	@BreitbartLondon PM you say we may never get a Coronavirus vaccine. No surprise, the scientist can't stop the common cold, and we still get flu with the so-called vaccine, so let us get our economy up and running again. We can't keep hiding from a virus. Let the vulnerable and fearful stay safe.
3707	109705	I really don't get this demand for vaccines that don't prevent covid but only lessen symptoms when you contract it. If kids aren't spreading it (see recent Duke study) then this seems like cutting in line. #ncpol
3708	202157	@kmonation I have gotten the covid vaccine about 20 times now. 4 Pfizer, 12 moderna, 4 Johnson. Once I got my first vaccine, I started cravings for it. There is something so great knowing I am reducing the spread of the coronavirus with each of them. I am feeling so empowered.
3709	107838	‚ÄúEveryone wanted to play again, but it‚Äôs still a gamble out there. This story is tragic and it‚Äôs not as safe as everyone‚Äôs saying out there, even if you‚Äôre double-vaxxed.‚Äù
3710	110337	I feel like this is gonna confuse people, especially since no one has a choice in what vaccine they receive.
3711	112573	And who would believe such a dictator like Putin? He can't even encourage his people to take the Sputnik vaccine. Just like China, whose orientation is that their country is a utopia and the rest of the world is rubbish.
3712	108160	Is this what we want for our country ?? I think NOT!! This should scare the beekeepers out if anyone considering taking jab. You have been warned üò°
3713	107855	"Trump thinks the virus will spike in places but the governors will ""put out the fires.""  OMG. We're so screwed. He's not interested in a vaccine. He thinks it's going away. #COVID19"
3714	108875	@KTHopkins Wow! I like coincidences! We had the virus outbreak in Wuhan,which has the Wuhan Institute of Virology,they build a hospital in 10 days,who could to die already passed away,they bring the vaccine probably to sell for a good price.
3715	111147	‚Äúbring a resident that is patient facing to get the vaccine in your place‚Äù and to ask the program director for their ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù assignment.‚Äù This is just awful. These residents deserve better.

3723	109773	@DearAuntCrabby The coronavirus was first discovered in the 1960s. Why wasnt a vaccine looked into then. Why wait until a pandemic?
3724	109035	Honestly‚Ä¶@GavinNewsom should override this order. People can now get any vaccine they want whenever they want at any pharmacy they want. More masking requirements won‚Äôt change their mind and it‚Äôs only going to cause more problems for businesses.
3725	110166	The way the IRL govt has handled #COVID19 &amp; #CovidVaccine is really making me regret moving home. They are so bad &amp; seem to believe they know more than the rest of the world. @DonnellyStephen @MichealMartinTD @LeoVaradkar @simoncoveney I don't want to raise my family like this
3726	112117	@1100RS @AlistairHaimes Flu is vaccinated against, so not everyone catches it.  Currently we have no vaccine for coronavirus.People also never catch the same strain of flu twice, however this doesn't appear to be the case with corona.Coronavirus is *not* the same as flu.
3727	112006	Is it bad that I would rather take the Uk vaccine over the US vaccine? I‚Äôve seen their steroid chicken is all. #lockdown #vaccinations #COVID19
3728	109154	@Lark_Goes_Dark My Shingles vac hit hard too. I still need to get the second one. Plus a covid19 booster &amp; Pneumonia vac soon. You are correct getting the vaccinations is a heck of a lot better then getting the virus.

3734	110274	@arinudman @maskartists @richardursomd The COVID-19 vaccine really isn‚Äôt a vaccine in the medical definition of a vaccine. It does not improve your immune response to the infection, nor does not limit you from getting the infection.
3735	108039	@andygoldstein05 So we have a virus in the world that we may NEVER find a vaccine for and will always be around like the common flu, good luck to you staying in lockdown and keeping kids out of school FOREVER! Covid-19 is going nowhere anytime soon........
3736	111894	@mithisa_motho This is not true. Check on WHO website or google you‚Äôll see SARS-CoV has had vaccines for years and covid-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. I don‚Äôt know what you mean there‚Äôve never been vaccine.
3737	112650	This is an appropriate step - a pause - while the data can be evaluated.   Such clots occur regularly in the population, so this MAY or MAY NOT be related to the vaccine.  That is why the investigation and pause is appropriate.

3741	110042	Whistler, Prince Rupert, the Downtown Eastside, Long-term Care. If you don't believe the good news from other countries, then believe what we're seeing here in BC. Vaccines work. They are the clearest path out of this pandemic. Thank you @j_mcelroy for telling this story.

3749	107867	@fangirlsmash @GravesWilliams6 I had all those diseases and have natural immunity. Also those vaccines  went through rigorous testing. They also aren't Coronavirus' which are different.  üôÑ Thus vaccine doesn't stop the spread.  Why aren't they mandating Flu vaccines.  My friend died in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
3750	111717	not gonna celebrate until I see these vaccines rolled out and no, not gonna praise the govt for the bare minimums
3751	109908	My only guess on why we are taking the Covid vaccine is to ease symptoms.We will all get Covid and unfortunately people aren‚Äôt listening to me about what vitamins and minerals to take to lessen its impact.Without this potentially harmful vaccine.
3752	109273	In case anyone‚Äôs still wondering why these craven GQP pols have done a 180 on vaccines and virus mitigation. Owning the libs has backfired spectacularly.
3753	107992	@Local12 Are the only parent who knows without a vaccine my child's going to love to go to school without being vaccinated up-to-date so is there a covid-19 vaccine that I don't know about for next year or what
3754	112122	@HappyDragon95 Honestly, I can't wait until we have a vaccine out for this so we don't have to worry about getting/spreading COVID-19 as much
3755	111069	Here‚Äôs the Toronto Star trying to push the same globalist agenda. Not happening. Masks come off once the vaccine is readily available. If everyone puts this intent in their mind, it will materialize. Question is how long will humanity let itself get pushed around? When is enough?
3756	110372	Like she üëáüèΩ says in the second video , ‚ù§Ô∏è will get is through ‚ÄúThe Dark Winter‚Äù as articulated by the great James Corbett It will get worse before it gets better.  But I agree with her, the Oligarchy will lose.  Because they‚Äôre insane and overreached re #COVID19 mass jab fraud.

3761	202093	Yesterday, a meagre 50k doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Colombia, a country with almost 60k COVID-19 deaths. After an overblown ceremony at the airport and a freaking motorcade, vaccine roll-out finally started today. This is how it's being handled. üò©
3762	111199	At this point, I'd prefer to be called an antivaxxer...if being pro vax is to participate in this circus, sorry not sorry.Who takes so many 'vaccine' a year? Since when is that a thing? And if you refuse you are labeled anti science?Get the F out with your new science. Sheep.

3771	108727	I am 1 of the 8. I‚Äôve received both vaccines, test twice a week for work and attended many in-person meetings relating to council matters in recent weeks, undertaken safely/professionally by our fantastic council staff. Labour‚Äôs unpopular #GreenBinTax is why they don‚Äôt want this!

3775	109602	@David_Durkan23 @judetigger @DarranMarshall For crying out loud!  Why do you lot think that people's reason for not wanting the #CoViD19 vaccine is a fear of pain or needles?  Do you think that these people have never had vaccines?  Do you think that they do not go to the dentist?
3776	109286	I think it is best to be realistic. #COVID19 has come and will stay with us. Hopefully, a vaccine has been developed and available in 1 year. It is interesting to think about if we could do the same as in South Korea, mapping every person that has tested positive,&amp; their network.
3777	107850	@WJCork My reason FOR getting the vaccine is for a religious reason. To love my neighbor as myself and being vaccinated with allow me to take the gospel to the nations and not worry about taking COVID-19 too
3778	112893	If you want to get vaxxed do it because you want to!!! I‚Äôm not afraid of anyone who‚Äôs un vaxxed, they pose ZERO threat to me or anyone else!! #Startlivingagain #COVID19 fear mongering is for show only!!!
3779	109585	@LorienElros @BarackObama @POTUS Sorry he passed. But no vaccine has ever had 100% efficacy. The Covid-19 vaccine has a 78% efficacy and the booster increases that.
3780	111601	@JJWUrology @ecclesias @SummerPMHNP This disaster right now exists Bc a deadly virus has been politicized. There‚Äôs a vaccine available to disarm the deadly virus‚Ä¶politicians refuse to speak TRUTH to their constituents.Covid-19 has a cure. It‚Äôs a vaccine!Those refusing the vaccine are occupying all the beds!
3781	112478	So they lost the market for their covid-19 vaccines and now they produced new virus so called omicron so that they can sell it's vaccines and overcome the loss they faced. Poor @ASTRAZENECAUK@AngelMutabaruka @imfurayiwacu @IGIHE @AJEnglish
3782	109241	@Boabbysam @timfisher836 Right. And Covid-19 vaccines are effective. There is no truth in advertising. This is opposite-speak.
3783	108234	@Macro__Business @anonymouse476 @Chuckjson @realDonaldTrump Actually you could develop a vaccine for a cold strain but the mutation rate of those viruses would render it useless quickly. So far novel coronavirus doesn't do that so there is hope. The Oxford vaccine looks promising and that is the trial I entered
3784	107786	If this doesn't disturb u then u are lost. The vaccine makers will not accept legal responsibility for harmful side effects &amp; since NGO's can't afford to, these people cant get a vaccine.But 'this is about health. The vaccines are safe.' Oh &amp; my favorite -'the vaccines are free'
3785	111002	Really cool that the US can fast-track development of a vaccine for coronavirus, but...  You're not going to get the coronavirus vaccine.  Why?  Half of Americans don't bother getting a flu shot in any given year.

3788	111718	If there has to be incentives in order to try to get the American people to get the vaccine, then (in my opinion) it is not nor ever has been a serious threat!!!!!!
3789	110198	I wonder if the anti-vaccine crowd is throwing coronavirus exposure parties like they do with measles or things...whatever doesn't kill you I guess...

3794	111253	Got my NHS letter inviting me to book my coronavirus vaccine today. I had my vaccine on Monday. That‚Äôs all.
3795	109567	Just 3 weeks into the study.  We‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs vaccine related but it‚Äôs a good reminder that there‚Äôs a reason why vaccine development takes time
3796	108633	New vaccine but don't burn you mask yet. Looks like Matt and Johnson may want you to keep wearing it.So they presumably will want to keep the full array of lockown meaures.
3797	111568	"""I would expect it to be as mandatory as you could possibly make it,""That means he already knows he can't legally force anti-vaccinators to take the vaccine unless if they get Centrelink payments and cancel those  payments if they don't!"
3798	109525	How the hell can anyone know if their symptoms would have been worse had they not been vaccinated? They‚Äôre still pushing for vaccines even though they got Covid after being vaccinated and boosted
3799	111456	@TheChuck1nator @Smilan317 @GovMurphy @B52Malmet I don't understand WHY you people that were JABBED think  it's okay not to wear mask or social distance just because CDC said so? Don't they also say the jab doesn't protect you from NOT getting Covid19 or variants of it or spreading it? It's just for supposedly less severe?
3800	109057	@TheFreePeopleA1 @DHSCgovuk Our news site tracks the progress of the vaccine for COVID-19 spanning all nations, it's prbly the case Americans will get access to the vaccine. The more interesting ques. remains precisely how effective it ends up being.
3801	112196	Y‚Äôall need to quit being bitches and get vaccinated. The vaccine is a product of years of research about coronavirus strains that existed before Covid-19. If they were going to push out an unsafe vaccine it would have come out a year ago when the pandemic just started.
3802	108523	This is a reminder that these shots are not actually vaccines. They don't prevent spread, they don't stop you from getting Covid. All they do is mitigate symptoms for a limited time. That's not a vaccine, that's a treatment.
3803	108608	This applies no matter what country you're in, but especially the US and UK. We know a vaccine is coming now, but it will be months before that starts having a effect and we all still have a part to play until then. We've come this far and need to keep going. #WearAMask
3804	111421	@UniLionsTom Hi, good to know, would like to be vaccinated with Medigen as well but afraid it won't be recognized in my country when going back home. The usual pressure from China üôÑ#covid19 #vaccine

This will change how the country behaves for years to come and may well mean the way we travel and work changes.

3809	111311	@CuomoPrimeTime @donlemonChris, until everyone who wants a covid-19 vaccine can get, it would not be fair to give preferential access to those who can get it. It would be double discrimination and it would only incetivize the well connected to skip the line even more.
3810	112336	@RichLowry Liked your op-ed on the virus. Coronavirus is not red or blue. But your point that DeSantis has always said vaccines are the best defense against it somewhat undercuts your position - if so, why not mandate them? Just sayin' - keep up the good work. Thanks.
3811	109928	@NBCNews #COVID19 does not care about religion.  If any person will not #WearAMask then they should just stay home. Not wearing one is harming millions of people &amp; 1000s have died so I don't feel sorry for anyone who refuses the vaccine or who refuses to wear a mask for ANY reason!
3812	108820	@DrOz I think the president is wrong. This is not like the flu. We have vaccines for that. We need to stay home until we have a vaccine for COVID-19
3813	111198	Why is there no pressure to find a coronavirus cure only the vaccine? Because there are more healthy people in the world who will take the vaccine. Someone needs to make money on it. You do the maths.
3814	110417	If i gotta drive through and get a weekly vaccine i would just beep my microchip and let me know where to show up.

3824	108678	Does having the coronavirus make you immune? If it doesn't, then the lockdown was a complete waste of time, energy, money, and our economy.If it does, then until a vaccine is proven, getting the disease is the only way to get immunity.#endthelockdown #OpenAmericaNOW
3825	108379	Does anyone wonder why 20-25% of the healthcare workers at a hospital would rather quit than get the vaccine?  Are they all stupid ‚ÄúTrumpists‚Äù who don‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve the science‚Äù?

3828	111314	Hello Pak Govt - GB Govt!? Imposing lockdown isn‚Äôt to protect us till vaccine is developed but rather to ensure the transmissibility of virus by infected person remains &lt;1. Once achieved lockdown restrictions are eased stepwise with SOPs in place to maintain that level!
3829	112277	@FourFourJordan No matter what we do, human stupidity will ensure that COVID-19 won't go away just like that. A vaccine is needed.

3832	111915	It‚Äôs too early to say for sure, but there are now reasons to suspect that vaccines will not be effective against the South African variant of coronavirus.
3833	108919	This isn't how vaccine trials work.There is not a process by which they purposefully infect test subjects with a live virus.They only need to test that the body is producing antibodies without side effects.
3834	112576	Next Pick $OCGN Deadly variant. Ocugen has the only vaccine grown from live virus. People will be more inclined to get this vaccine. Stock is going to $700

3840	108243	The fact that they paused it for a less than one in a million chance of treatable blood clots should really drive home just how careful they've been and how safe the vaccines are. Please get yours. If not for your own health then for everyone around you who may be vulnerable üíô
3841	110554	@TheRickHoweShow I'm kind of on the fence about the vaccine for covid-19 all as I'm wondering is how long does your immunity last after having the vaccine injected into your body is it 6 months is it a year like the flu shot

3844	112880	I will not take a vaccine. There are no long term studies to prove it's safe. If you don't want to take it tell them you're allergic to Polyethylene glycol and it causes you to have a sever allergic reaction. PEG is petroleum based. No thanks. I'll pass.

3853	109880	@TheMacroShow Dont want to be that person but the vaccine will fail according to the WOT the vaccine has only 25% chance of working and covid-19 can create a new strain and we will have to wait another year for another vaccine
3854	108590	Mass non compliance to vaccine mandates and passports will be the norm. How are they going to check and validate? How are they going to enforce? What will be the penalties? We will be in court for decades! We do not consent. Fuck you! #COVID19 #cdnpoli #Elxn44
3855	112328	Good news. Getting the vaccine is so important in addition to practicing the guidelines for prevention. I hope they stay well and safe!
3856	111949	@Miriam2626 I need your enthusiasm,I can't take this vaccine due to a life changing illergic reaction to Prevnar-13 ,6 years ago and my specialist said this COVID-19 shot could kill me because of the damage to my immune system and digestive systems. Thank you for the part I can't play !
3857	110185	I don't believe there's been one single elected Dem that has thanked President Trump for helping cut through the red tape, picking the right people to coordinate the logistics &amp; ensuring the vaccine is getting out to those that want/need it. @GovMurphy
3858	107858	How the hell do the Govt. expect to retain their credibility over the #covid19 vaccine when it's blatantly obvious the ones being demonstrated in the media are all fake?If it's genuine and low risk why aren't they being demonstrated for real?
3859	108642	The jibby-jabby is useless against the virus but successful in infecting humans with life threats! Go figure?
3860	108697	16. The virus will die off when temperatures rise in the spring 17. Coronavirus is the deadliest virus known to man 18. Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19 19. The virus originated in a laboratory in China 20. The outbreak began because people ate bat soup  (4/7)

3885	111145	@debbiekadams @kyrstensinema Evidence tends to show that herd immunity to this virus is not possible. A vaccine is also questionable. Coronaviruses are notorious for mutating and so far there has never been a successful vaccine developed for any coronavirus. Good luck!

3909	108789	I‚Äôll never understand how AB is still in the league. Falsifying a vaccine card is a federal crime!!! How many times is AB going to do something illegal and get another chance?
3910	109173	I‚Äôm worried, this is what will eventually happen, that people will start walk-ins to the vaccine centres since #cowinregistration isn‚Äôt helping much. Please actively manage the expectations sirs @CMofKarnataka @mla_sudhakar #coronavirus
3911	110245	So‚Ä¶ people won‚Äôt take a free vaccine cos they don‚Äôt trust medical expertise, and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it.But they will pay money for deworming goop meant for large livestock, without knowing what‚Äôs in it, and then trust medical expertise to save them when they OD‚Ä¶??
3912	111290	@DoHSocial @SEHAHealth any danger of someone letting me know if I‚Äôve had the vaccine or placebo as a volunteer in the #COVID19 trials? I was told 2 weeks ago that the results are being released........ still nothing.... I just want to know if I‚Äôm protected or not #4Humanity
3913	108260	Why are some vaccines getting more negative press than others? Pretty sure they‚Äôre all equally untested and bad for us. Is it to give the appearance that the ones they don‚Äôt criticise are safe? ü§î
3914	108216	Whoa....I‚Äôm so sad my family have and will get the vaccine. I warned them. I asked them not to. I had to let it go.
3915	110615	Don't get vaxxed, get the Rona, build natural immunity.Get vaxxed, 1,2,3, + times, still able to get the Rona, pass the Rona and then still have all the undetermined health issues with the üíâ that's injuring, maiming and killing ppl.I'll take natural immunity for $500 please.

3917	111361	@BrianLehrer @nytimes @carlzimmer @WNYC If the pandemic gets sufficiently bad, might we start using a vaccine that had proven to be safe, but not necessarily effective?
3918	112230	@MatthewJshow @JoeBiden Of course there is. WHO literally admitted that the PCR tests are creating false positives so how are they so confident in a vaccine that they don‚Äôt even know will stop coronavirus from spreading? As of recent, they have only been testing the vaccine to see if it has any side ...
3919	108089	@TimetoactOne @Trumptweets2020 FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus. EVER.
3920	110446	@RoyCooperNC Healthcare and worker rights are on the ballot don‚Äôt mistake this SCOTUS appt anything other than a trump get out of jail free card and no relief to coronavirus. If this WH can‚Äôt distribute PPE federally, how will they handle a vaccine?
3921	112376	@RealJamesWoods One doctor said there will never be a true Covid-19 vaccine because this virus is mutating in unprecedented ways.
3922	202307	I'm concerned that the covid19 vaccine is going to be obtrusively collecting data on me without my permission and uploading it all to a cloud server owned by an unknown 3rd party who will use my data against me.- sent from my smart phone.
3923	108277	@tom_nevin It is a complete gamble to plan a pandemic response the worlds first coronavirus vaccine being available in a year. Although it looks good and is a major (amazing) development, there are still some long term unknowns.

3926	112519	In fairness; if Tories had cracked testing and PPE, then had a separate team focusing on drugs and vaccines I would get that. The chaotic way they‚Äôve approached this is pure mismanagement and incompetence. Listening to Trump (?? bleach) is a clear symptom of this #JohnsonMustGo
3927	111263	@JimRHoughton @DrAmberKhan Eradication?   It's a virus that is going to be in the community forever.No previous coronavirus (SARS/MERS/Common Cold) has ever had a successful vaccine.... ever!   There's not only no guarantee for this one, it's very unlikely that it will happen.(cont..)
3928	202440	I got my #COVID19Vaccine!  The 1-dose Janssen vaccine.  Kicked my butt between 18-28 hours after getting it, with soreness, fever, and lots of sleep, but cleared-up real quick.  #COVID19 #vaccination
3929	111553	@MaddowBlog No matter what we do to curb the novel coronavirus‚Äîwhether through social distancing, wearing masks, or developing a vaccine‚Äîone thing is certain: This virus is never going away.
3930	112319	Can't get vaccinated yet, still broke until I can apply for the Cares Act &amp; get money for us next month but we need these vaccines, everyone does.
3931	108535	This idea that we are ever going to ‚Äúcontain‚Äù COVID-19 without a vaccine is fanciful. The only way to truly contain this virus without a vaccine is to keep everyone quarantined in their homes indefinitely which we all know is not realistic and has its own disastrous pitfalls.
3932	108046	My Coronavirus Vaccine Predictions:1. Trump will not directly mandate the vaccine, but won't stop it either.2. Mandates will come at state level. If you're in CA or NY, get out now! All states will jump on the bandwagon eventually.More&gt;
3933	109570	@john606sc @Waccoe1919 No one is shouting, John. It isn‚Äôt certain that people could catch COVID-19 if they don‚Äôt have a vaccine, that is utterly ridiculous to suggest such a thing.

3935	111994	@denisecockerel @Inevitable_ET @cjones4334 @inevitable #denisecockerel As far as the coronavirus, I don't see how you can sue anyone. If you decide to voluntarily get a vaccine, whether it promises antibodies against coronavirus or not. It's not an injury. The 'injury' has already done by the CCP labs. The world is trying.
3936	107697	@KatieM12121 Father and both Uncles had clots, one Uncle died.I have had Covd19 so cannot carry it or pass it on and have lifelong immunity.Why would I get the vaccine?
3937	108239	This is great news for us all. Please do get vaccinated the soonest as it is available in your locality. Our vaccines work and they offer protection against severe COVID-19, especially now that the variants are on the rise, the benefits will always outweigh the risks. üôèüò∑üíâüíØ‚ÄºÔ∏è
3938	108293	I don't buy into all this Q-Anon level of stuff about this virus... If vaxes work and masks work, I believe that's up to that person to do the right thing.  If they don't or they don't work then obviously everyone should be tested.  Even the vaccinated.#COVID19 #VaccineMandate
3939	110347	"That's exactly how I feel about this ""mad dash to the finish line"" vaccine they want to inject. As a doctor told me years ago, ""Medicines are great, but each one is technically a poison since it's not produced by your body's immune system."" Gotta be careful"

3943	108108	4 months?  For less than 1/3 of the population?  People are never going to do what they need to do to slow this. Maybe that's all the vaccine we'll need since our population will be greatly reduced and nearly everyone who isn't dead will have already had COVID.

3947	112203	The only way this won't occur is if the virus magically disappears and there is no second or third waves.  Will there be safe vaccine for this?  Well there has never been a safe vaccine for a coronavirus.
3948	112597	The covid-19 is from outside,now! will also the vaccine comes from outside? There is something fishy there,if the locals would participate in purging the pandemic by producing the vaccine may be it would be defeated.

3966	107953	Until there's a vaccine for COVID19 I'm only leaving my house to pick up supplies. With fools out there gathering in groups to only spread the virus further it makes it harder to have confidence to go back out into public. I'm retired thank God. Tough call 4 workers. Respect.
3967	109442	How does one determine who is a 'private citizen'? Does this mean healthcare workers who work in pvt wouldn't qualify for a free vaccine? Of course MPs and govt officials won't have to pay - seems a little like double standards to me...
3968	202321	Through 2/22, approximately 11.8% of North Carolinians have received their 1st Dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and 6.7% have received their 2nd Dose. Approximately 2.7% of NC is vaccinated (2+ weeks since receiving final dose).

3970	112126	If we treat COVID-19 like the flu it will be catastrophic. There is no vaccine, no one is immune (that we know of), it's more infectious &amp; has a morality rate that could be 30x higher. We have to limit exposure, it's the only prevention measure we have.
3971	110677	@candies2639 A pill to treat Covid19 is not like a vaccine to annihilate it. Get vaccinated to avoid the pill. Please.
3972	112163	Can we talk about how AWFUL I felt after my first #COVID19Vaccine dose? Chills, fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, muscle aches. Major flashbacks to having COVID-19 last year and had to have my fianc√© walk the dog because I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of having to go outside.
3973	112833	@journalsentinel Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

3974	112399	@TidyTops @godlessdivabich @starboard_light Duh the Covid-19 vaccines are not 100% effective,  and they have not been promoted as such. They will keep you from getting a SEVERE CASE if infected.
3975	111268	@uMarhobane With or without a vaccine? We never became immune to e.g. smallpox until there was a vaccine.Once we get a vaccine for covid19 I expect we'll put a lid on it; but until then if it runs unchecked I can see it going for a long time, becoming endemic.

3983	110747	Why only 40+, why isn't the AZ being used to protect all people in hotspots? There's a million vaccines in the freezer right now, and even if they were all AZ (which they're not), they should be moved to wherever they're most needed in Ontario.
3984	108644	My employer has explicitly stated, in both verbal and written form that getting the vaccine would be grounds for dismissal. I value my job, I get to do whatever I want and its paying me more than the guberment and the world economic forum combined.

4010	109879	You know, when I called this back in Feb I was half joking. I don't mind being a little carful about any new vaccine coming out. It's rushed so there could be issues IF we even get one. But why go out into the streets in large numbers to protest a thing we don't even have yet?
4011	109708	Just to state what many don't realize: there is no COVID-19 vaccine. There is a medical treatment, but it does not give you COVID-19 immunity (which is what a vaccine does). This is the single biggest medical experiment on live subjects in human history, but it is not a vaccine.
4012	110064	@MzAllieOsin1 If the vaccine doesn't prevent you from Covid-19 illness, just as the flu shot doesn't prevent everyone from getting flu, what the fk are you saying. For fk sake their in the cab of a truck, not going to concerts and clubs.

4019	202190	@JKJAVMY @Khairykj Dear, I have taken my 1st dose AZ vaccine during 1st batch on 7th May, if I can get my 2nd dose AZ within 8-12 weeks in Germany (also AZ vaccine) hospital, will you recognize me as complete full vaccination, issue covid-19 digital certificate (in MySejahtera)??
4020	112240	@LilUziBert99 @CallMeDave97 If you eat filet o fish don‚Äôt worry about what‚Äôs in the coronavirus vaccine
4021	107792	Just because you had covid last year doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt need the vaccine. The Delta variant is not to be trifled with. Get the shot üëáüëá
4022	109713	I'm polling folks I know from different backgrounds about their views on the Coronavirus vaccines, how important it is for them and if they will take it.Results in the thread below. Will keep adding responses through the day along with profile of person (w/o personal details)
4023	110388	@LoneSucculant @crowngaurav Idiot! üò°There is covid's vaccine in Dubai? Well, i don't think so. I'm trying to say Brazil have a lot of people who don't care about coronavirus too and don't protect they selves
4024	202213	This is why I‚Äôve decided to get my second dose and eventually a booster despite having had it July 2020 (and first vax May 2021). I‚Äôd rather be safe and I no longer buy the ‚Äúyou‚Äôve had it so don‚Äôt need to get double jabbed.‚Äù
4025	111704	@scotconant @Timcast What is there to understand ? 1) The vaccine is not a vaccine, but a gene therapy injection. 2) kids are practically IMMUNE to covid19 3) if old people are scared, they can get VACCINATED to be protected. 4) Vaccines are experimental ! Wake up, will you ?
4026	108605	@collette_books @michaelvkim So a vaccine like the flu vaccine that is only for strains that came out one to two years prior, yet the virus will mutate on a regular basis?  So does this mean we are going to have to get a new coronavirus vaccine every year, for the strain from the year prior?
4027	111629	Good info on Idaho's vaccine distribution plan. I'm glad to take last place in line in order for these folks to get the vaccine first.
4028	112688	this dude sounds like an idiot. he does realize the vaccine has been in production for a minute this isn't the first coronavirus we've seen.
4029	112673	I feel so privileged to have received my first vaccine today üôÇ so I will be twinning my vaccine and supporting @UNICEF_uk in their campaign to ensure everyone has a fair chance of being protected from Covid-19 üò∑ #GiveTheWorldAShot
4030	108007	People who never get sick because they have a robust immune system take vaccines under coercion, which by definition pisses about with the immune system, suddenly have problems with their immune system. How is this whole vaccine thing even a debate?
4031	109883	@MagpieGazzT @Carla_littlerob @GOVUK Coronavirus‚Äô are generally common colds - incredibly easily spread but very mild so we don‚Äôt need a vaccine to protect us.The issue with this coronavirus therefore is it is highly contagious BUT now deadly too .... &amp; we don‚Äôt have any population vaccine protection!
4032	110600	And what?? There‚Äôs tones of variations of the flu but you just take your yearly jab and get on with it, I get why this is important but it‚Äôs put across in a way that feels like pure fear mongering
4033	110668	This is infuriating. Also seems self-owning for anti-vaxxers to prevent people who want to get the vaccine from getting it. You want mask mandates, social distancing, lockdowns etc. to end then they should be encouraging people who *want* the vaccine to go get it.
4034	108944	"""@realDonaldTrump What Azar appears to be saying is that a coronavirus vaccine, once it is developed, will be left to the private marketplace rather than to government procurement. Private businesses, """"will actually sort out the demand, purchasing, stocking, etc."""""""
4035	111287	Omg they have just confirmed that this J&amp;J vaccine causes the immune system to attack the nervous system! And they‚Äôre exporting it!!!
4036	110099	#NoVaccinePassports - I‚Äôll fully boycott all vaccine passport venues/businesses, even if they support it now then change in future, I‚Äôll never darken their door again with my business or orders. Is there a data base or group going with a list? Let's put them in 2 tiers instead!
4037	108004	Bill Gates does not want to admit that the Coronavirus is DEAD and EVERYBODY is testing POSTIVE for the ANTIBODIES that KILL the VIRUS. Bill Gates wants to KEEP the VIRUS and FEAR ALIVE so that he can make MONEY on the VACCINES and FLU SHOTS that he will produce next year.
4038	112772	So it‚Äôs not ready yet, but he already knows it won‚Äôt be very effective. Sounds a lot like the flu vaccine. In a typical year you have 25-50% efficacy.Why bother?  If you want it, get it, but no reason to force everyone to get it.

4043	110116	COVID-19 does not exist. No one needs to wear a face covering, socially distance, self isolate, or get the so-called vaccine.
4044	108099	They openly say the vaccine doesn't stop the spread or protect you. It has fucking jellyfish in it so they can see it glow in the dark. It's a psyop.
4045	108659	@cedarproduct Airbags work; I still put a seatbelt on when I get in a car.Vaccines significantly reduce the risk of illness and death, they don't eliminate it completely. Never have, and never will. Our vigilance must be proportional to the risk presented. Covid-19 is deadly and contagious.
4046	112513	@CP24 Not a chance got my 1st dose of the vax and my face went numb and I still don‚Äôt have feeling back on my left cheek. I also have tingling in my fingers  and arm. Went and got it checked and the doctor doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong but attributed it to the #vaccine #COVID19
4047	110666	Lmaooo how are Republicans upset about who gets the vaccine and in what order when coronavirus is a made up pandemic to them? I'm lost...
4048	109673	After hearing that federal staff is being forced to get the Covid-19 vaccine in order to work and public businesses incentives to get the vaccine.  If you are interested in knowing what your legal rights are send me a message and I will get you the information that will help you
4049	112347	@DaveOshry I genuinely wanna immigrate to NZ if there's no coronavirus vaccine, please write me a letter of recommendation (I think that's how it works)
4050	112658	@BrianKohler2 @MzSha79 @ChancellorTV That's exactly what he said. He never specified with what or against what.The vaccine doesn't stop the virus. It reduces the symptoms. The virus is called SARS-Cov-2The vaccine deals with COVID-19 which is the symptoms not the virus

4052	112726	@GPrime85 @ooana We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
4053	109384	@thehill Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
4054	110257	Herd immunity is arriving.  Fauci and the rest who were hoping for a windfall from those vaccines are going to be pissed. @mitchellvii

4056	110902	"@NotAlexSheppard I know loads, but they don't call it ""Flu"" anymore 'cos the WHO recommended 75% uptake of flu vaccine has only been hit twice in 21yrs. So they renamed it covid-19 and quickly developed a new vaccine which they are pushing for everybody to take üòè"
4057	110020	My fellow Arkansans and Americans more widely, please get the COVID vaccine. If pro-economy is your thing, then do so to avoid another shutdown. If pro-life is your thing, then do so to protect our kids. #Arkansas
4058	111133	@Teensthack @HospitalsApollo @HospitalsApollo they are Delhi biggest chor in health services. It's not just about vaccines even in normal days they treat people like customers not like patients. #COVID19
4059	111573	And here we go.Watch as they roll out the vaccine passports, and I continue to not get one.I'll live in an earthen hut on the edge of society, and it still won't be good enough for the feds.  It wasn't good enough for them when the Weavers did it, and Ruby Ridge happened.
4060	201895	Can‚Äôt raise my right arm because it hurts so much, and it feels like I have a light cold, but otherwise those are the ‚Äúworse‚Äù post vaccine symptoms so far. I‚Äôll take it! #COVID19 #covidvacccine
4061	108138	They may want to stop reporting this if they want people to be vaxxed. This further makes the point that the vaccine does not stop spread. Now with symptoms lesser why does everyone need a shot that doesn‚Äôt work.
4062	111134	Do you love baseball and not dying?Head to an @ABQTopes game! @NMDOH is giving out vaccines in the stadium! If you get the shot you get FREE tickets to a future game! There are not many chances to get vaccinated while drinking a $12 beer - don't miss this unique opportunity!
4063	111867	@MLevitt_NP2013 @TheLancet I‚Äôm glad at this time in society we‚Äôre just calling out all the BS as we see it. I wonder how skewed these ‚Äúdeath toll‚Äù numbers from COVID-19 really are, and why after a few short months is there hope for a vaccine THIS year? Too many in answered questions. It‚Äôll come out tho.
4064	110840	@realDonaldTrump Why don't you help by starting the transition to Biden who  will take the Coronavirus seriously and actually help America get out of this Pandemic, instead!!??  Battling the coronavirus is more important now,  The vaccines are not released yet a$$hole
4065	108335	irl is not very smart. she thinks they are making a cure for coronavirus rn. ma‚Äôam. they‚Äôre making a vaccine. she insists no no no not the vaccine they‚Äôre making a cure. MAAM. you CANT CURE A VIRUS.
4066	109166	@districtai @CDCgov The only bright side is they have to stop treating unvaxed as second class citizens. Now that vaxed spread Covid-19 too, they can't guilt us into getting the vaccine to save others. No reason to mandate the vaccine. People can decide for themselves if they need the vaccine.
4067	107827	"@WayneDupreeShow Nope. Not taking a vaccine for this coronavirus. Might refuse to take a vaccine ever again if they all start including ""tracking"" chips or 'digital tattoos'."
4068	112209	@4dmbrown @mi6rogue @BorisJohnson It does prevent infection. It‚Äôs an effective vaccine that will protect someone who receives it by lowering the chance of getting COVID-19 if the person encounters the coronavirus.
4069	111691	You couldn't invent corruption like this. Trump buys Moderna vaccine after a member of their board just happens to resign before the contract award and is involved in the selection process...
4070	202060	Timely. I was recently reminded to check the coverage for vaccine side effects also by my friend.Please do, you guys :)
4071	107765	Biden is actually moving like COVID-19 vaccine- not following the process.Presidents need 4 years to select their cabinet.
4072	110038	so let me get this right, we are quick to develp a vaccine for corona but still no proper cure for cancer after all these years! ü§îüò≠ #coronavirus
4073	111612	@hivetosurvive @NHSEngland @RoyalLondonHosp @CliveMyrieBBC If you use my theory it explains 5-11sMy theory is we been weakened by flu jabs containing coronavirus or bird flu or H5N1 ur pick but are all the same5-11 only have nasal spray not jabbedSo they have very little recievers in them
4074	107699	Omicron is as contagious as measles &amp; mumps but I've never known anyone to have either of them thanks to actual vaccines providing immunity like vaccines do. Will we EVER get an actual vaccine for Covid-19 so we can stop the spread? The current shot is not it.
4075	108990	Big testing numbers and also even bigger weekend vaccine administrations. Thanks for getting tested or a shot.I know it's tough times at the moment but we can still get through this.Do #GetVaccinated very soon if you're eligible but haven't done so.#COVID19VIC
4076	110552	We are in an amazing position to overcome Covid19 because of what the President did to get these vaccines developed. He moved mountains. Yet, Dems will not give him credit and neither will the antivaxer Trumpers. Complete ingratitude.
4077	201991	swachhbharat: RT @narendramodi: Took my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at AIIMS. Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against COVID-19. I appeal to all those who are eligible to take t‚Ä¶ https://t.co/QCtkJiEdz3

4079	112589	#Moderna‚Äôs stock has gone from $18.23 on Feb 21st to $80.57 on May 18th. That sinking feeling you have might be because they are running a ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù scheme? Time will tell if their vaccine is real or just hype. #Covid19 #coronavirus #TrumpVirus #CoronaOutbreak

4081	111993	@Citizen004 Would this only apply to COVID-19 vaccines? If so, why? Would it stop at vaccines? Sorry, you can‚Äôt come in, I think your might have HIV, can you prove you don‚Äôt? Sorry, that cold sore tells me you have herpes, can‚Äôt risk you coming in!
4082	111999	There is no vaccine for SARS after seventeen years and there is no vaccine for MERS seven years on. These are two strains of Coronavirus. So it is highly unlikely that there will be a vaccine for SARS-COV-2 which leads to COVID-19.

4085	111750	@ALGhammer Meanwhile the Netherland are starting a lawsuit against the lock downs and the manditory vaccine. Stating 89-94% of PCR are false positive and they now know Covid-19 is just a normal flu. Nothing to worry about. Keep an eye on this.
4086	109658	If there‚Äôs any chance of controlling this until a proven vaccine is actually viable then that is to shut the international borders, keep them ALL closed, that‚Äôs why other countries have managed to do better! @cafreeland @NDP @liberal_party @RosieBarton @EvanLSolomon #COVID19
4087	108604	A sub-point I am thinking about talking about is how there has been some research done that getting the Covid-19 vaccine messes with some people's reproductive systems. This could be a scary fact for some young girls debating on if they are going to get the vaccine or not.
4088	108926	"somewhere out there someone is being woken up by the mike pence taking the coronavirus vaccine push notification from twitter saying ""i don't give a fuck about that cracker"""
4089	109666	Question? If vaccines are going to soon be updated to include protection (potentially) from a new variant, why would you rush out and get the old version and then not be protected? That‚Äôs like getting an old iPhone when the new ones just come out no? ü§Ø #COVID19
4090	111490	@JasonMillerinDC Yes Jason;Of course you'd have to take into account no one wants you to be successful.  Half your voters don't support an Coronavirus intervention.Its amazing you've decided to wear masks.Why not volunteer to skip the vaccine?These vaccines are despite Donald Trump.

4098	109995	My background is in science. ‚ÄúNovel‚Äù COVID-19 virus currently has no cure, no treatment, no vaccine. COVID-19 is currently transmitted in 68% of cases by extended families showing NO SYMPTOMS! Each person transmits to 2-38 people. Do you have children? Do you want responsibility?

4113	110641	2) Humanitarian aid is important one but the question is ‚Äòhow‚Äô? The long delay of COVID-19 vaccine distribution is because regime want to directly handle it and they want to legitimize itself.

4122	110213	COVID-19 vaccines, like flu shots, don‚Äôt work as well for new strains of the virus.  For that, you will need perpetual immunization, say vaccine makers.
4123	110980	This is great. They (quietly) rolled it out a month or two ago and I‚Äôve been using it as my vaccine record when I go places since. Highly recommend because it‚Äôs *so* simple and comes directly from the DOH.
4124	108464	Everyone is so surprised about the #DeltaVariant but this is literally how viruses work. You make a vaccine, and the virus mutates. Repeat.The coronavirus is going to have to become part of our general pool of viruses, like the flu
4125	108715	@News24 1. Realistically, how far away is a vaccine to Coronavirus?2. How long is it until South Africa would inline to get it?3. What percentage of the population would need to have recieved it before its unclassified as pandemic?

4134	108037	@rarelyused123 @samanthamarika1 I never said I was anti- vaccine.  I'm up to date on all my vaccinations.  If you can make a coherent argument for why I should get this COVID-19 vaccine, I'll listen.  Please include studies, numbers, and statistics.I'll wait.
4135	108562	This is the difference between China and USA. China wants the world to have access to any vaccine. USA wants its private pharmas to have patents so they can make money, maximise prices ensuring poor countries have no access. Which do you honestly prefer? #Covid_19
4136	109235	@KassandraKitson The Coronavirus vaccine is the seasonal flu shot but with an added microchip the size of a pepper flake. They never said it would work nor does it have to work. A digital global currency is the goal of the elite.
4137	109721	@jonfarquhar1 @PereginusD @Pammd6 @JaneMorganNZ1 @viewspotnz The common cold is a coronavirus, yet no vaccine has ever been developed to prevent it. Why? Because it's a moving target with new variants being its only constant. Sound familiar? The current crop of approved jabs would not deliver me any benefit.
4138	111958	@PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell @RepDerekKilmer @RepJayapal I will definitely wait for my vaccine if it meant those in prison get it, first.
4139	108472	@Melcatzzzz @Danza109 This is why I was strong on vaccines. No kid should be without a parent if a vaccine is available.

4236	109523	This is the New York Post so üòí but anyway, the 3 people didn‚Äôt get very sick which is exactly what the vaccine does and they didn‚Äôt get anyone else sick. So the vaccine worked.
4237	109781	I sort of figured this would be the way of it for a while. I mean, the vaccine doesn‚Äôt absolutely stop you from catching and spreading the virus. If you have enough antibodies, you might not contract it or get it more mildly, but a mild case is enough to spread it to unprotected.
4238	112289	"@GOPLeader I get a flu shot every year and have never gotten the flu. However, I'm not going to take this ""fast tracked"" vaccine until it's been properly tested. Testing takes time especially to verify that there are no side effects that could be worse than Coronavirus."

4254	109730	@realDonaldTrump WHY ARE YOU NOT BUYING VACCINES FOR THE AMERICAN POPULATION?WHERE ARE THE VACCINES? #COVID19 WHY DID YOU NOT BUT THE VACCINES?
4255	107934	Yes why @POTUS? No vaccine for me.  We already have things that work like our own immune systems if you treat them right plus other therapeutics. I don‚Äôt trust anybody in the pharmaceutical industry.
4256	108038	@Rectitude20 1. I will not take a Covid19 vaccine. 2. I will not take any of today‚Äôs vaccines. 3. There is not one vaccine on the market today that has been proven necessary, safe &amp; effective. 4. I will educate my family &amp; friends as to the truth behind vaccines. please RT.
4257	110886	Seymour questioned why Kiwis may have to wait until March to get a Covid-19 vaccine when the UK plans to roll one out next week. Effective and safe vaccines are very cost-effective health care interventions, which are the great triumphs of modern medicine. We want a safe vaccine.
4258	112574	"@MattHancock @UniofOxford When the present crisis is under control, pls also throw everything you've got at a #crohns vaccine. It ""only"" affects around 2% of the population but for those people (usually immune compromised) it is every bit as life-altering as #COVID19 has been for 100%. Don't stop here!"
4259	109637	@News24 There is not pure truth about this vaccinesEven though it is proven by SAHPRA; however it doesn't guarantee any effectiveness it might have our lives, what I see is that, we'll all take the vaccines shot up until post  COVID-19 Since our government is also turning against us.
4260	108145	@WADeptHealth your PSA calls the #COVID19 gene therapy a ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù. It is NOT a vaccine. Please stop lying to people and call it what it is. Or do YOU not even realize it‚Äôs gene therapy?

4264	111849	I quite fancy getting the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Not that I care either way which vaccine I eventually get. But I like that this one isn't profiteering as much as the other two.
4265	109042	This is the way to deal with Covid! The masks are not working! The vaccines are not working! Therapeutics like monoclonal antibodies to treat the disease is the way to go!
4266	112237	@JohnCornyn I‚Äôve only had the polio vaccine in my life, I never get the flu, and been around plenty of Covid19... I‚Äôll watch and review first.

4269	109640	@LSW1261267251 @MailOnline I will decide if and when I want a coronavirus jab, NOT The government! How do I know it is even safe?
4270	108176	If the COVID vaccines are vaccines they would stop you catching it. After all, with a polio vaccine we don‚Äôt still catch polio.
4271	202348	Just before Christmas so they can all go and spread it around at close family gatherings. You have to wonder if this kind of thing is done on purpose to increase cases &amp; justify the push and lockdowns for the next jab. My daughter's friend was one of these poor people.
4272	202015	You‚Äôve got to keep the vaccine at a certain temperature, then get people that first shot in a timely manner, or the product expires. Then get them a second shot 3-4 weeks later. Having identified the best candidates for the vaxx, you have this:
4273	110757	Very useful for everyone who does not want to take the vaccine but is facing increasing pressure from peers and/or family.
4274	107863	I just seen this on ABC. This is has turned into a lottery just to get people to take the vaccine smh.
4275	112473	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
4276	109163	@CharlieMod1 @piersmorgan I‚Äôm not a doctor so I wouldn‚Äôt say. Before you take any please consult your doctor. There‚Äôs no drug or vaccine for Coronavirus so it‚Äôs the doc‚Äôs decision. Trump must be taking that with his personal physician‚Äôs advise
4277	112380	Reading this just makes me want to give up life.And then I think I am not gonna make it easy for you. I am going stay here and fight against this until my last breath.#NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere
4278	110691	I think the question will you get vaccinated for #COVID19 is a bit of a rigged question. I am not against vaccines, &amp; I fall into a high risk category if I were to get #Coronavirus. I want a vaccine, but the question is do I trust the #Trump Admin to deliver a safe vaccine? No!

4281	110700	I get my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow and while I‚Äôm actually super nervous about it, I‚Äôm happy to finally get it done ü•≤
4282	111494	@dotsandloops21 @WGRZ This is an opinion. Even the military doesn‚Äôt want this vaccine. Specifically this vaccine. You people assume we refuse all vaccines. We don‚Äôt. Just the COVID-19 vaccines.

4284	108571	all of this knowing aaa DAMN well all vaccines do are disrupt our genes. everything they try to sell us harms us. it comes from the white man, WHY would they give us something beneficial?! completely beneficial? cmon they don‚Äôt care
4285	108406	@DavidLammy @BorisJohnson This guy is only thinking in the moment. What will happen if CoVid19 overlaps the flu season?? Realistically, if we're lucky, ll get a vaccine in 18 months (all coronavirus vaccine attempts have failed, so.. finger crossed). So how natural immunisation shouldnt be the main aim?

4291	107829	@realDonaldTrump Definitely but please have virtual sessions until there is #COVID19 vaccine and virus is under control. Kids have great immune but they are even greater careers. I have two elementary kids and opt in for virtual classes.
4292	110711	Is it just the way @Twitter‚Äôs algorithms are working my feed lately, or has the Coronavirus vaccine brought out every whacky ‚Äúanti-vaxxer‚Äù account and shifted them into overdrive?Seriously- the vaccine is ‚ÄúBill Gates Population Control?‚Äù Ya‚Äôll have lost your damn minds.
4293	112302	@MattWalshBlog There will not be a vaccine for Covid19; just like there is not one for HIV, there will only be a course of treatment for COVID like for AIDS.
4294	111590	Imagine your vaccine being so bad that you need to cheat in the second trial after messing up the first one. Literally NOBODY is gonna take this vaccine at this point.
4295	201827	Sign me the fuck up! I've got my first 2 jabs. I live in Tn, these morons are still actively avoiding doing anything about controlling it.
4296	111752	@pdubdev @benshapiro Flu vaccine isn't 100% effective. It depends on strain as the virus mutates. So far we don't think that happens with covid-19 in the same way. Not certain though.
4297	111500	@william20673995 @Hoosiers1986 @DallasTexasMama There is a vaccine for the flu. There‚Äôs no vaccine for the coronavirus. And we are the only country suffering, just look what happened to Italy.
4298	112092	This is so important to discuss! My school told us we have to wait until the vaccine is widely available to the public and get it from our GPs. Yet, my mandatory ED rotation starts next month where I will undoubtedly come into contact with COVID.
4299	112123	"So 90% of 25-34 year olds intend to take the vaccine. With about 80-90% of people needed to take the vaccine for herd immunity.What am I missing here? Is ""herd immunity is looking very likely"" too positive."
4300	108479	@tabitha_mueller Leguen is full of it. My son has a chronic kidney condition and could get the vaccine in almost any other state. Meanwhile, people in Vegas are signing up to do just one uber shift to get it. This is a disgrace. #COVID19 #WorldKidneyDay

4303	108242	Shouldn't be an issue to share this. The 4th person who tried Earth Tea Extra Strength Against Covid19 back in April 2020 just told us they did blood work and was asked which vaccine they took. She responded didn't take it yet and the doctor said her blood work looks like she did
4304	112814	@RhubbaComedy @Florence_WHyde It‚Äôs a coronavirus from the same family of viruses that cause the common cold. If you‚Äôve had this vaccine and you believe it‚Äôll give you immunity, then why should you worry about others?
4305	109397	@piccmeeprizes So CYDY is that the biotech company out of Vancouver, WA? Just curious... And if so are they working on the Covid-19 vaccine? Thanks. @piccmeeprizes #PiccMeePrizeGuy #GetOnTheWheel

4311	108094	Reckon I got the virus in Kuala Lumpur or Malacca where I was for ten days before the flu jab. But I think it possible the flu jab weakened my immune system to a silent virus - most people who get covid19 have no symptoms. On the plus side I‚Äôve had it so no fear!
4312	108458	@Alex_Neverm1nd @ChingusBingus1 @voiceoflg @BecauseReason11 @RealCandaceO Oh like the flu that has been around since 1912 and was never erraticated because coronavirus can never stop mutations and has had a vaccine for years and are not mandated because they only work 50% got it
4313	111068	So, this coming Sunday, 03/14, I'm going to receive my second does of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. Given that the second does is the one that most people get the symptoms after of feeling ill briefly, would anyone be interested in me documenting it in a thread here?

4316	111581	When someone tells you they have the right to refuse the vaccine, ask them if this is what they bargained for.
4317	111973	The real red pill is that the reason scientists study Coronavirus in the first place is to try to develop an HIV vaccine.

Now that the virus is endemic in our country,we have little chance of containing or mitigating it,until a vaccine
4322	110286	The funny thing is, they don‚Äôt even need the vaccine, just a recent negative Covid test. Don‚Äôt feel bad for these individuals in any way shape or form if they allow this to prevent them from going to a game.

4326	109621	My Mom just received her first Covid-19 vaccine! Thank you to everyone in the Brookings community who did your part to minimize the spread this last year. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better home for my parents during the pandemic.
4327	112625	@LAFitness I'd like to be clear: if you relax vaccine requirements I'll drop my membership and demand a full refund. When I signed you told me vaccines would be mandatory. I don't want to be part of the problem
4328	108112	@TheyTookMJ @phoenixashes189 Lol you proved my point. We have a vaccine for the flu, yet it still has a higher mortality rate than the coronavirus. A vaccine for covid will be just as useless as the flu vaccine because they mutate.
4329	110475	@JStuartAdams @BradWilsonGOP Stuart Adams and Brad Wilson are fools to insist on an immediate return to in person classes when we have a vaccine and are rolling it out (finally).  Remember their names and their disregard for human life. @slcschools

4359	112791	This is some weak ass bullshit. I sat on hold for hours to schedule my vaccine the minute I became eligible, and all I got was a sticker. Where's my gift card? This has college group project vibes written all over it, where the lazy get rewarded and the responsible get nothing.

4371	110258	@VlRTUALBOY I am going to put bugs in a smoothie with the coronavirus vaccine and some kale and sell it for 25$
4372	111912	"@OmarComing3 We could end 99% of vaccine hesitancy this week if we just agreed to call it ""Trump's Magical Warp Speed Juice"", so these poor fools will take their medicine already.  I wouldn't care if they only risked their own, but they're giving coronavirus a safe house to thrive &amp; mutate."
4373	110564	@BruceVotes @OwenJones84 Flu has a vaccine ,which protects and lessens,there is none for Coronavirus,had we not isolated,this would have been much higher
4374	112338	It seems vaccine refusal is very high! Next challenge is how we are going to break this streotype BS about COVID Vaccine!
4375	107917	...the exhaustion from getting my Pfizer COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine third booster shot and my annual flu vaccine shot together on Wednesday was kicking my ass. Then my therapist offered to cancel this week.I literally was so tired I forgot canceling was even an option!!! üòÖ

4377	112404	Thank you @BharatBiotech We are there to support you in this mission, any vaccine progress is good and it would obviously come with an amount of risk. Believing your intention is good! All the best! Politics on science is not appropriated!

4379	112188	@TheLastPersont2 @RidgeOnSunday @MattHancock You never get full immunity from coronaviruses, this vaccine all all others so far are only to reduce the severity of covid19, lesson the death rates. You will still catch the virus and still transmit the virus after being vaccinated. Lets get this right and we can move forward
4380	202148	Just got my second #COVID19 vaccine shot (was overseas January-end of May).Can barely feel the tracking chip. https://t.co/UvhMZ0UAxZ
4381	109923	This (unevidenced) cautionary tone implies vaccines don‚Äôt work. It undermine other government messages.They‚Äôre trying to be sensible, but they‚Äôre being very reckless. Just give us the good news. Vaccines work and it‚Äôs finally going well. Give people hope, man.
4382	202196	Good Morn Twerps. The Covid-19 Astra Seneca Vaccine is safe. Took it yesterday no adverse reaction. Pls take it let's end covid-19.
4383	109230	Good Morning!It is very wrong for any pastor to advice his members not to take Covid19 vaccines. It should be personal decisions. But, my fear is that this vaccines may not be potent when administered to Nigerians. Can't we develop our own vaccines? #FreedomSquare@solid1009
4384	111095	Well, I don't care if there a vaccine for this horrendous deadly martian disease killing all inhabitants of Earth. I wouldn't take it if there was.But, defund Congress until they allow the re-opening of all States. They are they reason that States are being so restrictive.
4385	110910	@heycrest @AfChloe If you have had the vaccine and you somehow get infected, there will be rapid response to the infection and it'll get eliminated. In intermediate steps, if you do an antibody (AB) test which detects AB against coronavirus, it'll be positive because your body is actively fighting
4386	108524	@SethAbramson The variant in COVID-19 can make you sicker, yes. But the vaccine will still work, it just gives more reason why we need have the vaccine quicker. It is a normal process for any virus to mutate.
4387	111664	@ElectricMiknik @SeamusDuke @coronavirus How are we supposed to live any sort of life until we have a vaccine then. Life is an unnecessary risk and If people don‚Äôt want to incur risk let them isolate if they so wish.
4388	109027	@DanRather This may sound harsh but I think all those elected officials who denied the science regarding COVID-19 should be denied the vaccine if and when it‚Äôs developed.  After all we can‚Äôt deny one science and then support another science it‚Äôs all and nothing
4389	110865	Trump is pushing hard for a vaccine; that's all he or any politician can do since so many Americans have stopped social distancing and mask wearing. Getting haircuts, going to bars and parties, protesting. Americans surrendered to Covid-19 out of selfishness and entitlement.
4390	108131	the only reason they're doing this in the first place is that they realize that the movement to suspend vaccine patents and make them free for any country to manufacture is gaining traction, keep it up
4391	108998	@CNN I will never trust Dr fauci or the vaccine please everyone for your own safety do not take the vaccine the put coronavirus patients in nursing homes to purposely kill a lot of people DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE

Could u b fearful?
4395	111510	#COVID19 #coronavirus #vaccine Dr Fauci saysScientists are hoping for a coronavirus vaccine that is at least 75% effective, but 50% or 60% effective would be acceptable.MY TAKE : 50%-60% is a low bar. The lower the bar the less likely people will take the vaccine
4396	202005	I just received my first COVID-19 shot today. There are so many reasons to get vaccinated and the biggest one is that you‚Äôre worth it! #PennStateHealth #Moderna #modernavaccine https://t.co/vbZnwlsupW
4397	108106	@1215Deb @SandiZStandee I'm 72.  I will only get a vaccine for Covid19 once they've developed and tested it.
4398	108196	@chrislhayes - COVID-19 is killing hundreds of thousands of people, the vaccine may be the answer, but maybe not, we just don‚Äôt know, but the next pandemic is around the corner. Why not talk about ending animal agriculture instead, this is where the pandemics are coming from!
4399	107921	Have üá¨üáß we given this vaccine out already in our Britain? It appears so.. Then most of them are in that age group, due to our government's priority list.. Do we üá¨üáß need to have a think about this perspective? If there is a merit to their finding, what have we done to üá¨üáß?? ...
4400	108270	@NightmareHolic @eretserus @elonmusk Human herd immunity is the only effective vaccine. It‚Äôs the only way this virus goes away for good. You can only create a vaccine for one strain of this thing at a time. I‚Äôd also love to see any evidence of any vaccine working against any previous coronavirus.
4401	111042	What‚Äôs in the injection?   It‚Äôs not a fragment of ‚Äòcoronavirus‚Äô which can be treated.   It‚Äôs different from a vaccine in that instead of the immune system building immunity to the pathogen..the immune response is to create more of the pathogen if or when encountered again.
4402	112907	A photo Op that is laughable.  I hope I'm wrong, I'm usually not, but this vaccine could spread coronavirus to the point that it could make it worse. The reason I say this is because it mutates quickly.  Will still are so unsure about why it is so powerful and THAT

4409	109380	This probably is not good. Vaccines seems still to be able to work but treatments for infections, less so.
4410	107734	"@margaritaevna95 How will the vaccine ""end"" the pandemic if people who have contracted COVID-19 are getting it again after being officially ""cured"" for weeks? This is a never-ending game we'll just have to accept as the REAL new normal after a certain point, that we can't stop it."
4411	111726	means testing the coronavirus vaccine, if you make 20k or less you get a tax refund worth 50 dollars if you get the vaccine and 5 dollars gets knocked off every 2.5k more you make until you get to 45k in which case you're on your own

4425	109592	@TaurusLondono What it says is the coronavirus was in a bat population, they took that virus, recombined it with another virus for purpose of finding immunotherapy or a vaccine, but failed bc: 1. this new virus mutates too fast, and 2. it‚Äôs immune to practically everything. It was lab-created.
4426	108298	I am no anti vaxer but not interested in #COVID19 vaccine. PM said 3AW he would make it as mandatory as possible, the flu vaccine is not (not once had a shot &amp; never get the flu), why mandate covid? The vaccine is rushed &amp; would prefer to wait 12mths at least.How do others feel?

4586	109612	@chris_lertora @CBSNews Since Vaccines still keep you from getting the virus, yes they are not 100%, they keep you from spreading the virus. Only if you get COVID-19 you spread it. Therefore vaccination keeps the spread down.
4587	112038	@Milhouse_Van_Ho They just didnt design the trials that way. What they did is pretty logic, they build the trial to find out if the vaccine would prevent covid19 (symptomatic infections). Remember that asymptomatic infections (not sick with covid) are only an issue if you infect someone at risk.

4602	111920	@DavidWh22347920 @jkenney Easy answer to that. Max Vaccination and herd immunity only works when the pathogen is slow spreading. In the case if Covid-19 it spreads and mutates so fast in the antivaxxers that there is a HUGE possibility for a moron to be a new patient 0 for a virus that skirts the vaccine.
4603	112023	Now‚Äôs a good time to start talking to the older people in your life and make sure they have all the info so they feel comfortable w/ getting the vaccine! For example: my grandpa said he felt like he‚Äôs made it this long so he probs doesn‚Äôt need it, and we‚Äôre working on that!
4604	110154	News not given by party for good deeds.If you do good things media makes the news. Hope you understand @ArvindKejriwal #AndhraPradesh #COVID19Vaccine Well done @YSRCParty @ysjagan üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
4605	109581	@jason_bane FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus. EVER.
4606	111357	@ilysheezy it‚Äôs actually bc the site over there in Wuhan (?) had put in a request for funding to try and put coronavirus in bats, in an attempt to create a super vaccine. They got declined for funding obv and then miraculously covid spread bc someone ‚Äúate a bat‚Äù like a year or so later lol
4607	109327	Why is @GregAbbott_TX getting the vaccine before front line workers and the elderly? He needs to wait like the rest of us. He‚Äôs been openly killing us since #COVID started. If we‚Äôre still alive in 2022 we need to vote him out. #AbbottFailedTexas #TexasDeservesBetter #TexasCovid
4608	109594	@WordOfNadja @benhabib6 Interesting! I knew Sweden led many countries in health care. Individualism is quite prevalent in America, but has its pluses and minuses, particularly when individuals are wrong but believe they are right, such as those refusing to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. Questioning is a 1/
4609	111006	Looking to interview someone with mental illness who has struggled with isolation in the past year, or for whom the Covid-19 vaccine is a beacon of hope, about their experience.This is for an article on mental illness &amp; vaccine eligibility. I can keep you anonymous. DM me!
4610	202328	Happy day ‚ù£Ô∏è Got my 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine üòä I'm so thankful I was able to receive in a relatively very short period of time üíï Hope this pandemic will ends soon üôèüò∑#vaccinated @WHO https://t.co/e5BbYgAyND
4611	112379	@globalnews If vaccines actually prevent infection and retransmission, then it is one thing.  But if they do not, then what is the passport indicating?  The bearer will not get too sick, or die of Covid19?  Covid19 is not the biggest killer in this world.  Other sicknesses can be serious too
4612	202019	I was fortunate to receive the first dose of the #COVID19 Moderna vaccine yesterday. My heart is full + I am so grateful for science. ‚ô•Ô∏èü¶† https://t.co/xygC6BnGsF
4613	202374	Doubled jabbed as of yesterday. Like last time, only side effects are sore arm &amp; feeling tired (went to bed at 20.30 last night!). Feel much better this morning, although who wouldn't feel good after 10 hours sleep üòÜ #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
4614	108858	@edusanchez19us @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @senatemajldr So stupid. The Chinese Weaponized Coronavirus Spreads. People get infected. That's going to keep happening until we reach herd immunity throughout the USA or there is rapid treatments &amp; working vaccines. There is no stopping the Chinese bioweapon. You can only delay infections.
4615	112505	@SHEsus__Christ They actually working on a HIV vaccine right now it will work like crap you take the vaccine every six months and it will be based on the same type of technology that got us the covid-19 vaccine
4616	110557	THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE that you will not be participating in my life if you do not get a vaccine. #CommonSenseNotNonsense
4617	112235	So question If someone has contracted covid19 previously is there a need to wait any specific time period before taking the vaccine?
4618	112691	I sometimes wonder if the leavers types are scared of the coronavirus vaccine because they think it‚Äôll make them become a rejoiner :)
4619	108626	Don‚Äôt believe him? Well then he will show all of you he‚Äôs fine on national television. Just like he did with showing that the vaccines and treatments work for coronavirus
4620	108729	I'm not anti-vaccine, but can I have some faith in my immune system until I see if my friends grow any extra limbs in the next year or two? #Covid19
4621	112487	It‚Äôs possible already to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccine on CVS app but literary on MA there is no way to get any appointment. total dissapointment
4622	111411	There were several mutations before Delta emerged and it won't be long until it mutates to a strain the vaccine doesn't protect against.
4623	109702	Simply, getting #COVID19 vaccines is like to train dogs (your immune response) to defense thieves (virus) in the yard. They are NOT well-trained, may bite the virus, or may bite you or may drool over the virus
4624	109993	I can‚Äôt wait, in ten years my late night tv will have ‚Äúdo you or someone you know take the Covid-19 vaccine?  You may be entitled to compensation.‚Äù Commercials everywhere
4625	107861	@AndrewHolnessJM Question: is it true that the vaccine doesn't prevent the coronavirus? (If that's the case, what would be the purpose of taking it then.)
4626	110217	*Is this what the testing is about, do they want to identify those who haven't received a flu vaccine? *Dr. Rashid Buttar says everyone who has had a flu vaccine the last 10 years would likely test positive for the Coronavirus, which they will use to further the police state!
4627	110095	Twitter is telling me : don't look. I don't know if it is legit, but I need to give it a shot myself to judge if yes or no. And keep using my brain, common sense and researches instead of letting the medias tell me how I should think and what I should believe. #COVID19 #vaccine
4628	109596	@TribeJefferson @citizenwillis @gtconway3d Oh no, these aren't 'rallies'!They're official Whitehouse press briefings.Or maybe an official Coronavirus task force briefing.Or maybe an Operation Warp Speed vaccine briefing.Or wait, maybe I'll sign some executive orders kind of meeting.They'll figure it out as he goes.
4629	109471	@TsarNichII Agreed govt always kills more people. But in the history of vaccines and illness, there's never been a human vaccine for a coronavirus, but now is the time? You're right it's non-zero, but extremely close to zero.
4630	111233	@CindyKendrick11 Vaccines against the related coronaviruses that cause SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have worked in animal models only. There has not yet ever been a successful coronavirus vaccine.
4631	112030	@Danada54 @ProudSocialist @SymbioticWrld That is indeed a very concerning point, but it's not an easy one to digest for the mass-public.  Completely changing the economic system is much needed, and humanity is running out of time.   60% of all staff workers don't even want to take the Covid-19 vaccine here in CA, so...
4632	109309	This is despicable. at this point I am starting to believe they‚Äôre using the pandemic as a form of population control/eugenics the way they keep promoting the COVID hoax to their constituents but are first in line for the vaccine&amp; making sure they have health insurance.
4633	202303	Jacqueline Alpeter posted in June a photo of herself with these words around it: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not having the vaccine. My body, My choice.‚Äù In May she posted a photo of herself and the words ‚ÄúI trust my immune system not an experimental vaccine. My DNA, My Choice.‚Äù https://t.co/xLIkF7JxJe
4634	110685	@Cryptof69260077 @genesimmons I found out last week that we‚Äôve been working on this vaccine since SARS and swine flu, they‚Äôre coronavirus too. It‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve been working on it so it‚Äôs not as rushed as we think.
4635	109168	Don‚Äôt agree with this to be honest. Genuinely don‚Äôt care how much it costs or who profits from it, just get the vaccine created, scaled up, distributed and prescribed ASAP so we can all see our family &amp; friends again and stop thousands more deaths.
4636	112098	@CBCAlerts If herd immunity doesn't work, then a vaccine won't work, and we might as well open up now. Immunity to coronavirus being shortlived would basically be the end of any hope of controlling it.
4637	108460	This really would explain everything... and would mean we need to adjust the research needed to make a vaccine... ASAP.
4638	111539	#COVID19 testing and vaccine information + health promotion has to be culturally-sensitive and community specific.I keep seeing vaccine comms. suggesting ‚Äúget the first vaccine you are offered‚Äù. HOW does this address the hesitancies or mistrust amongst people? #ONpoli
4639	202393	@tomselliott @ezralevant So if I got my initial shot two days ago, the booster will be due on the 8 month anniversary of desperate Afghans falling out of the sky from American military aircraft.  #Afghanistan #COVID19 #Talibans
4640	109170	@DrEricDing I doubt I will forget my 2nd COVID-19 vaccine dose if I can get the first one. Maybe I'll download the app later as a goodluck talisman.
4641	201868	Got my letter through I'm getting vaccinated in Methill??? Do I need a jab to go to Methill before getting the jab in Methill?? #coronavirus
4642	111305	@pfizer @PfizerCA can you please comment on this. This is very concerning if our Provincial Health officer is planning to not follow the proper dosing schedule here in BC for your vaccine.@CPHO_Canada may need to step in on this.#bcpoli #covid19bc #COVID19Canada
4643	109065	People not understanding that 90 ‚â† 100 and trying to use one offs as proof the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work are annoying af. I‚Äôll take my chances with the 90% and y‚Äôall can play around with the 0% effectiveness of having NO vaccine all you want
4644	108752	In all likelihood @realDonaldTrump will do exactly the same with a vaccine if developed in USA. Only hope is that developer is outside US. But @nadhimzahawi is the kind of politician that will allow poisonous slimy chlorinated chicken in to Britain because it offers - death!!
4645	108733	As expected, very welcome news. People with compromised immune systems may not mount an adequate immune response to vaccination. @CBSEveningNews @CBSThisMorning @FaceTheNation @CBSSunday @60Minutes #Covid_19 #immunocompromised #vaccine
4646	111089	Christ. This is if people actually follow the guidelines.On the plus side; new job in Feb, guy I'm replacing has done very little due to Covid, thought we'd have a ton to do then as Vaccine will be start improving things. Looks like an easy couple of months for me...
4647	107711	You're not having the Covid-19 vaccine? Good, more for me then.I've been inoculated against the 'rona 25 times and there's nothing you can do to stop me.
4648	107803	Who cares if people get sick with coronavirus? You'll likely recover &amp; have antibodies in your system. But no...Big Pharma doesn't want you to develop immunity naturally. They want you to pay for a vaccine...so that you develop immunity (when you could have for free).
4649	111087	@CDCgov hi, I am wondering, with the vaccine coming soon, will people need to be tested for covid-19 before being vaccinated? Do we know what can happen if one is asymptomatic and get the vaccine?I think the possibility of this to happen is very high.
4650	111102	@bencorke @Keith99352796 @UxbEconomist07 They never claimed it did. You made that up. It reduced the effects and hospitalizations of covid. Then idiots like you refused and made it worse. You do know with been research coronavirus vaccines since the 80s? This wasn't the 1st covid. It was coronavirus ID-19.
4651	109541	Gates is an admitted eugenicist and wants to force you and your families to have a coronavirus vaccine. üëá
4652	111730	@stuartflatt There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever get one.
4653	202047	Big Bird rules. My wife and I got our boosters a week ago today and my ten-year-old niece is getting her first one tomorrow and we couldn't be prouder.
4654	202041	I can feel my Pfizer #COVID19 vaccine working. The increasing loss of autonomy as the government takes greater and greater control of my thoughts and movements through the implanted chip.  1/2
4655	108014	NO cuz there‚Äôll be NO vaccine for this coronavirus becuz it mutates &amp; there over 10 strains. Canadians have been infected by different strains cuz it is mutating. Hence NO virus will be found like our regular flues - too many strains!! One shot - no guarantee its the right strain

4663	112231	How long will it take for the 16% to reach 100%? Is the recent boost in vaccinations enough? Although we still don‚Äôt have enough vaccine supplies to begin with‚Ä¶
4664	110596	@MuffinTimeYay @ChrisMcK2018 @SkyNews @AlokSharma_RDG The common cold is a coronavirus and no vaccine has ever been found ... in fact no vaccine has been found for a Coronovirus strain
4665	112425	If you have the vaccine you can still get the virus and spread it. No vaccine has been shown to fully stop the spread.
4666	107890	Preparation would seem like a good idea to roll out vaccines for younger kids ASAP once approved. @SaskHealth @SKGov @MerrimanPaul @Carla4Lakeview @ not on Twitter Dustin Duncan
4667	109041	"@KING5Seattle Of course they do. That's what this is all about. Follow the money. Not complicated to understand. Hell, the NIH signed a contract with Moderna in Dec. 2019 before the ""plandemic"" to secure rights to any coronavirus vaccine that they may develop. Look it up."
4668	110001	There seem to some serious issues with the vaccine roll-out. The first people getting the vaccine are not emergency responders but ANYONE in gov't. This is happening locally for me as well. Not enough talk about this.
4669	109086	@RottenInDenmark came out in the news that Getting Covid19 can cause ED that does not go away after you recover from Covid19 so get that news out there it seems like it would be really good incentive especially for those who mistakenly think that getting the vaccine would emasculate them.
4670	112643	IMPORTANT- Been waiting time see something like this. It‚Äôs a schematic outlining how the #COVID19 #vaccine might be distributed when there is not enough (or who is considered first priority etc) üëá
4671	112008	If every country can use crash test dummies to save lives, then why don‚Äôt the creators of the three different Covid-19 vaccine share it too? It doesn‚Äôt make sense that we don‚Äôt have enough vaccines for the entire world. Work together, make a difference, and open the world. ‚ù§Ô∏è

4678	202387	@AshleyGunstock Just to say today was my first volunteer shift with the covid-19 vaccine program at a 100% independent pharmacy (which is also a post office and normally a news agent) and that they are doing a fantastic job and saving lives far and wide.
4679	108638	Question: If an unvaxxed person contracts covid-19 then beats it and fully recovers. Why would they need to be vaccinated? They have already had it, wouldn't it mean they are immune to it now? Just curious &amp; im fully vaxxed btw.
4680	109426	@reviewjournal Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.

4683	112515	If contracting, falling ill, surviving, and recovering apparently don‚Äôt give you immunity to the virus, then why is there a vaccine even being talked about... also, can anyone who wants that ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù just take a bullet to the dome instead and quit wasting everyone‚Äôs time
4684	111983	Quite amusing to see #antivaxers having the #COVID19 #CovidVaccine and the excuses they give for why they‚Äôve had it! üòÇüëçüíâ
4685	112822	Will the US Covid vaccine be free of charge, too?   If we are really serious about mitigating this virus, I would hope so.
4686	109315	@FergalBowers @rte Hey Sherlock As you claim to be an journalist why aren‚Äôt all the poor countries that have no vaccine or only 5% vaccinated not dying in the millions ?Are they immune to #COVID19 Or is it just an western disease ü¶†
4687	110679	@Bald_Eagle_2 @Unity_Coach And we dont even know long term effects. Theoretically if it gave people Alzheimer's or is ischemic lesions or autoimmune or cancers we might know in 2 years. Coronavirus vaccine animal trial history is fascinating
4688	110589	Well, Holy Pf*ck. The state of NM has decided that I *am* vaccine worthy ‚Ä¶ Pfizer, in my case. Must be a computer error cause the code works and all, but looks like I get shot tomorrow. #COVID19
4689	111653	My question, to folks, that encouraging others, to take vaccines, for COVID-19. Say, the person listen, to you and get vaccinated, and after get COVID-19 and die or the person die from vaccine, without having COVID-19.  What would you say, to their love ones? Opinion
4690	110837	I love this @ChrisCuomo. It's absolutely no sense. Everyone should ask him/herself why we don't see cases of Polio, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Tetanus, Varicella. It's because we have vaccines. Please, get ready to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Together we gonna win. Vaccines work.
4691	112103	@SkyNews The proclivity for rapid mutation by RNA viruses has been known for decades. When the 1st #COVID19  mutations appeared targeted to the Spike protein why were vaccine developments not reoriented to contain additional virus antigens? This is not hindsight it's learning from history
4692	108439	I have zero sympathy for any adults in the US getting Covid-19 and who passed on getting the vaccine. They should have to pay out-of-pocket for their own medical care. If people want to be stupid, let it be on their own dime.
4693	110179	@RealBasedMAGA @LVNancy 1. Flu has a vaccine that doesn't eradicate the virus, returns annually.2. Cancer doesn't have a vaccine. Years of study and $90+ billion spent.3. COVID-19 has a vaccine in testing, COVID-19 has only been around for a few months.It's like COVID-19 is a miracle.
4694	109280	WAHH MODIJI WAHHWhat a partiality is going on in this country!!!!!! CBSE students are students and they are the future of this country and they can suffer from Covid-19, but the SSC students are Not students they are vaccine of Covid-19 there is no worries for there families.

4697	108829	@NikolovScience @KassandraKitson One must ask,  why would Fauci fund millions to a chinese lab for gain of function testing on CoronaVirus......while also funding vaccine research for those same Coronaviruses.  Especially when he's the lead guy in the US for a pandemic response.    Odd no???
4698	112401	Wokeninams don't care about the price. Even if they are cheaper (heck even if Sinovac will just give them for free), as long as they're from China, their sinophobia won't stop tingling until they persuade the public that the Chinese vaccine is some kind of biochemical weapon. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

4706	108505	@SpankHorton What do you mean by ‚Äúduring the vaccination process?‚Äù You can‚Äôt predict whether a variant will happen or not and if it does happen, if it will breakthrough a vaccine. We‚Äôre in Omicron. That‚Äôs the 15th variant. Publicly available information.
4707	112915	@hungryjesse @afneil This whole right wing obsession with Sweden's Covid-19 stategy is clickbait. This unscientific belief that herd immunity is a viable option, when it's just natural selection. No viral herd immunity has ever been achieved without the use of an effective vaccine.
4708	112358	@JustinPulitzer I‚Äôm not saying to keep the economy shut down till a vaccine is approved. But no one has made a plan to social distance while opening the economy. If you open it up and say it‚Äôs open, people are going to think it‚Äôs over. Go back to what they were doing before they heard of COVID19
4709	110974	This is great news even if it‚Äôs still too far off - kids need vaccines yesterday. School has started in most places.
4710	107692	"@JohnCornyn I don't get why ppl think having 380k ppl test positive for a novel coronavirus is ""okay.""Hypothetically - if no one died but it still spread like this and ppl began having the actual disease and we're sick for days or weeks at a time with no vaccine or know who's infected"
4711	202091	this shall serve as my official request for my newsroom/all newsrooms to henceforth refer to the vaccine, exclusively, as ‚ÄúFauci Ouchie‚Äù....hearing no objections, the resolution is adopted *bangs gavel*

4715	109659	If hydroxy chloroquine is effective against #COVID19 Would the funding dry up? Would the Gates Foundation &amp; their ties to #Fauci be severed? Why doesn't media ask #Fauci if he and his friends have a vested interest in finding an expensive vaccine vs a generic treatment? #OAN
4716	109806	@Jo19291031 @ToniParsons14 @Anna98831 @ProfTerryHughes @GeraldKutney the coronavirus exists because of climate change and human consumption. Viruses are fuses for overpopulation. New viruses form when normally separate species are forced to share resources, like after a wildfire. Next pandemic is coming from south america. Vaccines or prevention?

4718	109966	@WSJ @WSJopinion @gerardtbaker How do you think the globalists got a huge supply of miracle vaccines in short order. They money laundered through Afghanistan. Then they created a coronavirus pandemic. Our benefactors are psychopaths.
4719	111824	@MusubiBrand @theflowernurse @LarouxVandyk Now if someone would develop an actual vaccine for a coronavirus, we‚Äôd be in business. But after decades of trying , no one yet has been able to do it.
4720	108511	Thisüëáüèª is the pivotal moment the US loses its hegemony. For the world to see, global organizations and other countries are presenting a pandemic response that the US has bungled. Also, the power of price setting: how can a vaccine now costs $30, $300,... in the US?
4721	109756	@jamesmatesitv The #Covid19 problem in Europe has NOTHING to do with #CovidVaccines as they make no difference and may do harm.How people hang on to convenient myths!The solution is herd immunity. Which, like Sweden, is now happening in the UK.I know what I'm talking about.
4722	107914	Israel: Pfizer's mRNA vaccine is only 64% effective in preventing coronavirus infection after two doses, compared to 94% in May. In addition, the researchers warn that it is too early to say how effective the vaccine is to prevent hospitalization.
4723	112093	@sunlorrie you want to know why there is vaccine hesitancy. Because it‚Äôs all a damn lie .. the government obviously has not one clue about science so why would anyone in their right mind go get it. It comes with no relief of the tyranny so obviously it does not work
4724	107941	and when the virus mutates, will there be booster shots and will they all have nano technology/ chips in them as well?so quickly done to...ALMOST AS IF THEY ALREADY HAD IN IN STOCK AND JUST NEEDED TO ROLE IT OUTTO THE BEGGING DESPERATE WESTERN WORLD
4725	112028	If the Coronavirus is a virus and the pharmaceutical companies can come up with a vaccine for it, can they come up with a vaccine to the AIDs virus and give it to kids before they start elementary school and give it to all of the adults in the U.S. too??!!
4726	110193	"In my latest article for @Tech_Networks, I've asked the question ""Why do some vaccines last a lifetime?"" ü§îWhy are COVID-19 vaccines seasonal, but the measles shot lasts forever?üíâThe secret is in my article below üëá#scicomm #CovidVaccine #COVID19 #science"

4730	109755	I don‚Äôt want the coronavirus vaccine because the government is putting microchips in them to track me, a clearly important person somehow, getting high off my ass and shoving fistfuls of potato chips into my gullet while watching the Simpsons üòî
4731	108767	@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo Please can you do something about our criminal government here in UK. The way in which they're treating us like guinea pigs with an experimental vaccine is like things you read about during WWII. They will seriously end up harming the population.üôèüèª
4732	110524	A worthy read about the problems with our current testing system and how that will play out as the vaccine is rolled out.
4733	110268	6 out of 7000000 had clots. How are they sure na yung vaccine ang cause? Same with AZ. ????? I dont get it, why would they delay the rollout for this very very very very rare instances (that may or may not even be related to the vaccine).
4734	111917	@dirtydiscooo I just had Covid-19 a few weeks ago and I'm not getting the vaccine. I'm also diabetic. Still not afraid. I survived it and I will continue to live life without fear. Never give up, never surrender.
4735	108611	Well darn! Just when we thought it was safe, hahaha, lol, Get the jab they say and everything will go back to normal, yea right! No to the VAX has been preached for awhile and NOW you know WHY!
4736	110932	@thehill Why are employers sacking the un-vaxxed - and businesses ban them - the vaxxed can still get Covid-19 and still spread it to others - are equally infectious - so there is no protection of staff or customers ??? Can any employer or manager or MP explain this ???
4737	107687	Right cos so many people have ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù? Where has he been the past 4 years? Anyway, nobody better come near me unmasked unless I say otherwise. Im not trying to test the efficacy of my vaccine with my health problems. This so called doctor is going to get people killed
4738	108682	@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump They will take away all your credit on the Vaccines innovation and the fast work you put in for extensive testing. No other country in the World has such an extensive COVID-19 testing.
4739	109031	@CNN @andersoncooper @drsanjaygupta Given how devastating this pandemic is, should we consider an ‚Äúin-vivo vaccine, where we purposely expose healthy people to a coronavirus positive individual for a brief period, in order to give them a mild viral load, in hopes they will mount an immune response and avoid serious
4740	109098	So, if not taken urgent steps to infuse resources, the #COVID19 vaccine may be a rich country commodity. Uneven spread of the vaccine may not be a good idea either. A porous wall is a little or no protection.

4744	112059	getting a covid-19 vaccine should be a law. you don't want it? then go to prison. no, you can't pay. it's unbailable. the only way to get out is to get the shot or rot in jail.
4745	110608	Know a climber or outdoor person who thinks they don't need the COVID-19 vaccine? This one is for them -
4746	109971	"Fuck this stupid country. A private clinic is offering Covid-19 vaccines to 30+ year olds but it looks like they are just in it to rip off the local counties that actually budget and provide universal healthcare but for political reasons get billed when private clinics ""help""."
4747	109130	The superspreaders of the Coronavirus get the vaccine first after calling the Coronavirus a hoax &amp; brainwashing others into believing it, then spreading the Coronavirus, causing over 280,000 innocent people to die. üôÑ

4751	111749	@tevapharmeurope   I Never believe you be sick of those sicknesses like covid 19 coronavirus that need immune system trigger and bovine colostrum supplement can't respond. It is a workable solution in my opinion. You know they are stronger than influenza vaccine? natural G-d sent
4752	111045	Seems the only answer to Covid-19 that the establishment will accept is a Bill Gates vaccine. We all know why.
4753	109034	It‚Äôs gotta happen then. Herd immunity, I‚Äôll protect the elderly in my family but I‚Äôll risk me being out an about because most of us need to get immune to this we can‚Äôt go on like this till there is a vaccine #StupidThinking we can.

4756	110263	@lizoluwi @johnlittle Unlike countries where #COVID19 is rife, we can easily afford to wait until a reliable effective vaccine is available. I just do not understand why people are in such a mad rush to take something sub standardüôÑüôÑ

4764	108867	@WAVY_News And it COULD also be just another variant they're collecting to develop next year's iteration of the vaccine. My god! STOP IT.The obiden administration is collecting 25k samples (per wk?) for DNA sequencing in preparation for next year's flu/coronavirus.Don't go hysterical.
4765	108949	Y la vacuna Rusa? Solo Argentina... And  the Russian vaccine? Not even Mexico uses it. Only in Argentina.
4766	112578	By allowing places to charge for aspects of administering the vaccine, you make the guarantee of it being free everywhere less believable. I know most places aren‚Äôt charging, but if people had to pay to get tested, why WOULDN‚ÄôT they think they‚Äôd need to pay to get the vaccine?
4767	110871	This is serious for the US. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are hard to produce; quantities are limited. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine needs a new Phase III trial. Now this one has to restart its trial, too. If the J&amp;J vaccine hits a snag, there‚Äôs not enough.
4768	109606	Before the bad takes ramp up: this is the only vaccine that won't need freezer-A necessary option for regions without access to tech. And very good to see

4775	109143	@WFKARS @PapaMojoJoeJoe Unvaccinated folks with no valid, specific MEDICAL excuse for not getting vaccines need to start paying constant daily penalties until they man-up/woman-up and get their shots. Otherwise, America's Covid-19 pandemic, which should have ended months ago, will drag on for years.
4776	109505	@Q13FOX BUT what is her vaccine record? Any flu shots in the last year? Then she will give a false positive for coronavirus. There‚Äôs coronavirus in the flu shots of the last two years.

4784	111458	Even after a COVID-19 vaccine comes out and it works, the Democratics will not be willing to give up on there power that they gained so easily. They will try to keep there tight grip on everyone.
4785	112229	@benshapiro I had mandatory vaccines to attend school  (I'm 62) my kids had mandatory vaccines to attend school (they're teens now), what is the difference @benshapiro ? BTW, I bet you had the covid19 vaccine,  right?
4786	107780	@ccpolitics123 @jaketapper The herd immunity you recommend is estimated at 60-80% of the population. No one, including NY, is safe yet.    Another factor is that when the virus does not kill, it can cause terrible, perhaps lifelong damage.    Also, the annual flu vaccine works against a coronavirus.
4787	110466	This government's idea of dealing well with #coronavirus is hospitals coping, the economy continuing as though there isn't a pandemic and using cases to find a vaccine. It's not to prevent cases. They don't care if people get sick, have long term problems or die. 1/
4788	108345	Is it me or this administration is using black doctors and nurses as props for encouraging Americans to accept the vaccine? First to get COVID-19 and die, First to test the vaccine. Doc Rivers: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs amazing why we keep loving this country, and this country does not love us back‚Äô
4789	110607	Lmao @ all the men in my DM after I posted about Covid-19 causing erectile dysfunction.Yall want the vaccine now huh?
4790	108522	I don't know why foreign residents from countries that don't  have universal health care system are desperately finding fault in ours.  Japan needs to modify some of it to match this global pandemic explosion, yes, but COVID-19 vaccine is not the holy grail.   1/2
4791	109681	Honestly the coronavirus vaccine is really fucking cool. Instead of using dead pieces of the virus they are using the RNA which our own cells will use as a blueprint to create proteins shaped like SPIKES, hence the name coronavirus. Our cells will know how to make tiny crowns now
4792	110167	Any person that discourages vaccination‚Äîwhether passively or actively‚Äîis just either plain unaware or deliberately malicious. There‚Äôs been ample research and reasoning on getting the COVID-19 vaccine: it stifles the chance of powerful mutations, and allows the return to normalcy
4793	112592	@kieraevebutler Kiera your comment about me being a vaccine skeptic is inaccurate and offensive. I'm not vaccine skeptical.  If you watched my IGTV on the coronavirus vaccine rather than making a facile assumption you'd know this. I expect a correction (and an apology would be nice).
4794	108050	And you wonder why people are concerned about getting vaccinated.. I‚Äôm not an anti, but completely understand why people would hesitate.. there is no long term data, no matter how much you claim ppl are stupid not to blindly get the jab

4801	112447	In China 0,006% caught the virus resulting in 3200 deaths. Can anyone do the math for 60% of population catching the virus?This is crazy, we need containment and lock down; we need vaccine immunity not herd immunity killing millions
4802	111402	There're a lot of reasons this is terrible but just one of them is now they've incentivised unvaccinated people to show up to work even when they're sick and/or to avoid getting tested.üôÑVaccine mandates are good but they cannot be enforced with policies like these.
4803	111121	In all seriousness, can I sue someone that is vaccinated for giving me COVID because they are knowingly going around spreading the virus? Because I can sue someone that gives my HIV who knowingly spreads it‚Ä¶. #FoodForThought #Covid #CovidVaccine #coronavirus

4814	109151	@GovParsonMO I don't believe the vaccine has gone through enough testing and with the way the COVID19 mutates, no vaccine is going to be effective at any given time.  I think we are going to see some major health issues arise from these vaccines.

4821	108020	But the Vaccine doesn‚Äôt working forever only for temporary to save lives humans.  If you lucky and healthy you will okay. But when you go out still need to wear mask to protect yourself. You don‚Äôt know who else still has a Covid19 spread. I am always wearing mask  when go out.
4822	108808	@dpakman There's a certain level of optimism/pessimism at play. It's been months since lockdown and we still didn't beat it. We've never have a coronavirus vaccine. If you don't think we'll eliminate it, lockdown doesn't make sense beyond keeping hospitals from being overrun.

4837	108550	@wesbury @benshapiro @ianbremmer We have animal vaccines for a coronvirus and we've never had the motivation or incentives to make a vaccine for a coronavirus until now. So I'm bullish on the vaccine front.All I'm saying is that we can't be cavalier about spread among 20 year olds for all sorts of reasons.
4838	202406	Have to say that I am pretty happy tonight. Got my first dose of Moderna‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine today with my husband. It is the beginning of the end of our quarantine. Second dose on 1/26/21. Looks like a better year w new president and less covid. https://t.co/jZnYHmKBzw
4839	110439	@_J3551C4 @CP24 Or the vaccines don‚Äôt work at all to stop transmission and infection like they were promised too‚Ä¶ Not to mention unnecessary mass testing and widespread positive attribution to asymptomatic people who may or may not have a coronavirus like the common cold‚Ä¶ üôÑ
4840	108435	Every festival this year is going to be cancelled. The reality is without a vaccine, mass group gatherings will not be able to go ahead safely. It's a catastrophic blow to the whole sector. #Festivalshttps://t.co/aejfxpRb5v
4841	110103	@Jazzdoggie2 @nytimes False. If they wanted to protect themselves and they trusted the vaccine, they would take it by their own free will. And in fact they did that. Obviously the situation with covid-19 is very different. Don't let the Fake News Media and Dems brainwash you son.
4842	112570	Today I will be goi g to work without a vaccine thanks to @fordnation oh and he also took away my paid sick days. But then again I‚Äôm a dispensable black person why would the @OntarioPCParty care #FordfailedOntario
4843	109992	If Europeans or Bill Gates wanted to kill Africans they would have done it long ago and wouldn't have to use COVID-19 vaccine. It would've been easier to use McDonald's, KFC, Starbucks, Pepsi, Coca Cola, Fanta, Colgate, Heineken, Amstel etc
4844	109917	Someone explain to me: if #COVID19 doesn't affect kids in any obvious way, why would some try to make vaccines mandatory for them?
4845	107794	At this point a vaccine is the only way out of this thing. It's already spread too far and too fast. #coronavirus #COVID2019
4846	112506	Now Dolly Parton has funded the Covid-19 Vaccine and I'm reminded again of a great mindset. Do good - and if you want the plastic surgery and it's not harming anyone go get it, don't judge and give back too. 3/3
4847	109222	@def_not_sophie @hrtablaze Coronavirus vaccine will never happen. These mutate too quickly. The hope is that they mutate into a less deadly strain

4852	110014	@CP24 My question is it‚Äôs been proven by many scientist that this virus mutates itself within 10 hours so how is this vaccine going to cure COVID-19 if it mutates itself that quickly? And how does it take a decade to produce other vaccines but this took under a year?
4853	202377	Got the first covid-19 vaccine today!If you're going to get it from Mbagathi Hospital, like me, use election day timing. I got there at 8.30am and got the vaccine at 1.30pm then shortly after, they'd ran out so be there early! Here are some other venues giving vaccines. https://t.co/fKrbNuSavd
4854	111875	So China has been quiet regarding a #vaccine . You would have expected them to have the first vaccine for #COVID19. Very strange you don‚Äôt even hear about their infections nothing? While the rest of the world grappling with a #newstrain #newstraincovid ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§≠üëÄ

4857	112842	@PedzisaiRuhanya Covid-19 virus has a right to life, vaccine will kill the virus, that's not cool. The virus has rights to exist in us.
4858	109325	I'll tell you what, if the vaxer's can get past the shots from my gun, then I'll take their shot of vaccine!
4859	109996	I live in AZ.  If THE TRAITOR @dougducey makes that VACCINE MANDATORY Fla is where I'm moving.  I've NEVER had a FLU vaccine and Not taking the LUCIFERase mRNA Covid Vaccine
4860	109826	Right. Because getting the vaccine is only about the self interest and safety of the individual...not that person's loved ones or their loved ones. This is so gross.
4861	110925	So, how did they not know this? There are dozens of vaccines on the market.. more proof they have no clue as to what they're doing and they don't work
4862	108868	So Sajid Javid is saying ‚Äòas long as a minor is competent they can overrule their parents‚Äô by having the vaccine.In the #BMJ it has already stated that there is no medical benefit to jabbing kids.  The govt to taking our social freedom for granted. #VaccinePassports #COVID19
4863	110520	So fair to say it make no difference if you have vaccine or not you still going to get it and vaccine does do much to stop it
4864	108097	Im afraid to  touch that vaccine  trump rushed it they said next year but now they say nov i hope ppl that get it will be ok
4865	112128	My question would be how much time until this variant becomes extinct (and if it matters for the vaccine) üòÅ #justkidding

4869	110214	I don't get the point. Fully vaccinated people can spread covid.. plus u18s don't need a negative test so they can go in and spread covid anyways!!! Still haven't seen a valid reason why vaccine passports work.
4870	111877	@chicagobeers1 @Causeway06 @SeanCasten Coronavirus‚Äôs have been around forever and they aren‚Äôt going away. Similar to the flu. It‚Äôll be here. The vaccine only work 3-6 months and it‚Äôs looking like they‚Äôre not very effective. We can‚Äôt live in fear forever.
4871	112613	When pressed to clarify, WHO Spokes-neutral gendered non declarative asexual person said, ‚ÄúSure we said the vaccine was necessary to ‚Äúget back to normal‚Äù, but then we realized we can‚Äôt keep you locked down that way so.... sorry, you‚Äôre fooked.‚Äù ü§¨ü§™

4873	109862	So no #COVID19 vaccine for all in India, Hmm! But isn't this advocated all around the world? Big question will be who gets #coronavirus vaccine? Would the ruling parties prefer their voters? Would rich and powerful will benefit and poor and needy be left out? @MoHFW_INDIA
4874	109403	@User_First_Last @florian_krammer @Valueinvestor41 The idea we‚Äôll never get a good enough vaccine to eliminate this coronavirus (or make it endemic) is beyond pessimistic thinking. Getting a good vaccine in 2020-21, from thereout perfect while minimizing transmissions and developing therapeutics
4875	110351	.@JohnCornyn, because of math. If comprehensive eligibility (rather vaccinating everyone) starts in May, give it two months for everyone to get the two doses of the vaccine + 2 weeks waiting period.

4877	111901	@QTWIQ1 This is why we get VACCINATED, so that we don't land in your situation.    I got Covid-19 before new years. Guess what, it only lasted one day.   Vaccine did its job.   Hope you feel better.  But if not then I pray God receives you in his kingdom.
4878	112334	C's kagwe has a point but poorly presented. The vaccine being marketed has the ability to modify our genes which is irreversible. Are we now in agreement to have Gene modified human beings when we have all the time refused Gene modified foods.
4879	112784	So much for ‚Äòfollowing the science.‚ÄôThe science isn‚Äôt clear, that much is obvious and this is why no one should be discriminated against for not taking this vaccine just yet, especially if they‚Äôre young and healthy.
4880	110850	Btw: Results for our #COVID19 clinic this week show PLENTY of positive ppl in the area. The pandemic hasn‚Äôt ended - we can only try to contain it till a vaccine/proven therapy. So if u wanna lose gyms, salons, &amp; stores again? Then keep disregarding the rules meant to protect us.

4882	110390	@FTondalo Agreed... The second wave will be much bigger, and more deadly as it will completely overwhelm medical facilities.There's nothing resembling a treatment or a cure, and vaccines are far off--and may not even work for this variant of beta coronavirus.This may not go away.

4895	109167	@ABC I think this is the prelude to much bigger crisis. Reinfection of #coronavirus #COVID19 after taking the vaccine. Once again the a symptomatic may be dangerous after taking the vaccine then virus mutates and spreads this may be called #COVID21 dangerous of all before.

4908	112861	Yes, wearing a mask is meaningless to stop yourself getting covid-19 and with a vaccine, you don‚Äôt need one to prevent spread. But it‚Äôs kind of ridiculous to expect people who have been used to wearing them for like a year now to immediately drop it. Give it like 2 months.

4917	109858	Gonna leave this here. I theorized months ago that the reason the vaccine was so quick to develop is because it was already in existence. They developed it in conjunction with possible weaponization of Covid according to this article. Still, tons of naysayers in the thread.

4949	112295	People know their own bodies, their immune system.If you don't normally get the common cold, viruses, flu..... don't get flu shot--- why should you get the vaccine.
4950	108167	@jasjiv @naomirwolf If you missed it like we all might have done, reported like an after thought that a covid19 survivor only needs the first jab, as a booster. If that isn't stupidity it is a devil may care attitude. No one in their right mind would follow that recommendation.

4960	112349	@kenkelly1 @LaFleurDelSur @21WIRE And the very reason I process what he is articulating to make the informed decision that it would have to be an exceptionally cold day in hell before any COVID-19 jab comes my way.
4961	112081	This article just makes it sound like LGBTQ people aren't getting the vaccine because they're antivaxxers, fat, and stupid.
4962	112639	It's because there's nothing they can do about it.  It's not like we have a national health service. A vaccine is at best months away.  A stimulus check...? It's destroying these towns, it is actually worth the risk.  The virus *might* affect them, but poverty definitely will.
4963	108310	The Pilbright/Gates work they reference is for an avian coronavirus - but it's a live-attenuated virus, which means there's a probability that some of the inoculated poultry will get sick.  An analogy is contracting polio from the Sabin oral vaccine.
4964	202233	Today is a great day! Not only is it my 1-year anniversary (back) at @timmonsgroup, but it's also the day my wife, a school teacher, will receive her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.
4965	112905	I am glad that you have this chance rather than being forced to take the vaccine. However, once a week sounds pretty stupid. You could come down with Covid the day after and infect any number of people before they test you again if you are not symptomatic.  No logic.
4966	112813	My dad is a kidney transplant patient as well. We don't yet know if he managed to develop antibodies. His condition is the reason we have been in this house for 600+ days, only leaving for groceries and medicine. Please keep masking, socially distancing, and get vaxxed.

4975	112087	Would you prefer we were like China?  They are sending out most of their vaccine and hardly allowing any of their citizens to be vaccinated.  They are using the vaccine as a political tool to curry favor with other countries.
4976	108609	May (The Month) will be when I can start getting the Covid-19 vaccine, if stocks are available by then.Might do a blood work to see what other vaccines I lack or need a new boost.Plus it's been 2 years since my last flu. Annual Influenza Vaccinations do work.

4980	112809	This is Bad.  With a capital B.I'm desperately hoping that the phrasing of the question just left people maybe not answering what we think they are here.  Many may have just been answering whether or not they'd take an untested vaccine rushed out for Trump's political benefit.
4981	109436	@schristakos @BetheMckenzie @friendlyfulcrum @austinfiredept These are very good questions.  The answer is, no almost no one who has a vaccine has died from covid19 or other vaccine related complications. The numbers are minuscule.  And it is a valid question to ask. Taking the vaccine saves lives. You are alive today because of vaccines.

4990	112763	@RosieRobertsonx @_seevy @Elliech_ Those vaccines have been around for years NOW, but people swarmed to get the polio vaccine because of how rampant it was. You‚Äôre missing the point with that one. Covid-19 is a virus, and so is the flu. The basis for the flu vaccine has been approved for years, but each‚Äî
4991	109812	They still don't have FDA approval for ANY covid vaccine.  All are still on emergency use authorization.  Flu shots are at least approved.So yes, that does impose on my liberty.  If you want to keep taking these experiments, be my guest.
4992	108509	@DavidLevan15 @lucyallan @BorisJohnson People keep talking about immunity. Current (small) results suggest immunity gone within 6 months. Just like other coronavirus. It will need yearly vaccines that will be only partially effective.
4993	109712	Lol people are living in a fantasy world. Everyone who wants a covid test can't get one, pretty sure government is going to mess this up too. Also, we don't even have a vaccine yet anyways.

5032	111425	@mojos55 Flu mutates too, and we have new vaccines each year. The vaccine from Oxford was designed in a few weeks as had the technology and just needed to tweak it for coronavirus. That vaccine is already in Phase 3, it is being manufactured as I write. Read the science.

5035	112767	@briannatravers @FerrierSteph #COVID19  #slowdownmethod I think the vaccine for the epidemic is the last chance.

5036	111175	@DaFlumps @kradlum @NHSuk You cannot read? It says, They Don't Know if the vaccine can stop spreading, catching Coronavirus or if it gives immunity. Nothing. There is no evidence. You are free to think what you like and refuse to hear what you are told and what is in front of your eyes.
5037	108723	I'd stab anyone trying to force a vaccine into my arm then I'd never stop killing those responsible. I'd assume I'm dead already and take as many with me as possible. All the animals died in SARS &amp; MERS mRNA studies so deadly FDA denied Human trials.Resistance no matter the price

5039	109936	@Ashaman3000 @Lizzy_Lang7 @PryceTheHeretic #9 is the reason they should get a vaccine, and hope not to get a Covid-19 infection.
5040	110222	@thedsggroup The vaccine is important long term. Particularly for the most vulnerble.And when covid19 mutates, they need to be able to adapt quickly and possibly annually like the flu.So that's still good research.3/end
5041	112255	@KHONnews Why in the world would someone who already had coronavirus get the vaccine? Newsflash everyone: if surviving coronavirus doesn't give you immunity, we're all fucked, because that would mean we have no idea how anything works.

5043	109619	@SDECoxHealth My not be a medical expert but I have a brain. Coronavirus is an RNA virus that mutates more rapidly than other viruses. So even though we magically had these vaccines in the US before the virus or right after it didn't get us ahead of new variants.
5044	112213	So when the vaccine is developed for Covid 19, do the anti-vaxxers get it or do they stick with their beliefs and die? #antivaxx #coronavirus #COVID19
5045	109045	Urgh this tears me down. It's definitely not ethical but if we don't have everyone vaccinated there would be so much transmission risk- if there was a way to combat socioeconomic barriers for equitable access to the vaccine then maybe a mandate is okay? Feeling conflicted #hst440
5046	111981	There's a good chance the Covid-19 vaccine we are all waiting for will be developed abroad. Actions like this almost guarantee the U.S. won't be prioritized if/when it is.

5053	112246	While the coronavirus mutations are useful for telling lineages apart, they don‚Äôt have any apparent effect on how the virus works.That‚Äôs good news for scientists working on a vaccine.
5054	110610	@or_pip Once governments decided en masse to ‚Äútackle‚Äù coronavirus they were locked in. Moral panic to extent, but nevertheless only one way out of this nightmare - defeat coronavirus.

5058	111444	@TobyBerry6325 Astra Zeneca is using a chimp adenovirus to create a protective immune response that would attack Covid19 if there is exposure to it. I believe the Russian vaccine is using the same adenovirus for their vaccine.
5059	109263	No sense in rushing it. If it does come before election day, (based on how long it usually takes to go through the various phases of any drug or vaccine for safety, dosage and efficacy) we will KNOW it is bogus. That is why Mitch is trying to get the liability laws changed.

5062	108898	@EssexPR We‚Äôve gone round in a huge unnecessary circle on the science. Why comparisons to influenza viruses came in I don‚Äôt know. That virus mutates way faster than coronavirus. Exposure to viruses gives people their super immunity. The vaccines give people a safety bet on symptoms.

5066	110617	I believe in vaccines (and also respect the fact some do not believe they‚Äôre in the best interest of their family), but am surprised they found enough families willing to test this out. I‚Äôd spoken w/several MDs this summer who said it would be v. difficult to get test subjects.
5067	111751	@ANCALERTS @ABSCBNNews This is like comparing apples to oranges. No vaccine for coronavirus. That‚Äôs the problem
5068	110988	If you‚Äôre unvaccinated stop being stubborn, stop believing lies &amp; STOP THE SPREAD. The mRNA vaccine has nothing to do with DNA or chips &amp; everything to do with staying alive when you get Covid. You could not know how bad Covid will be until it‚Äôs too late. Why? Protect your life!
5069	112816	@eoinmadden @Interse42081117 If there is a safe vaccine using attenuated virus as 'traditional vax' with is not producing spike in your body - the actual pathogen - then I would take it after proper testing, yes. But no one ever managed that for coronavirus family of viruses before so not likely.
5070	112514	@Dsockz @drdavidsamadi This is just a version of the flu and no one will get permanent immunity to a coronavirus from a vaccination. My immune system is phenomenal. Never had the flu shot and never had the flu in my life. Won't be taking this vaccine either 4 &gt;99% recovery rate.
5071	110223	If I was a driver and a rando offered me a shot of vaccine, I would not believe it. But good on them for offering. And good on the brave folks who rolled up their sleeves and took it
5072	112249	@VaxHuntersCan This video shows you my experience on getting the #Covid #vaccine and how it is starting to change my life for the good (open up the world again)!  Check it out!https://t.co/041bk8wotXEnjoy! #COVID19 #vaccine #pandemic #coronavirus
5073	111120	@WhiteHouse What happens if China or WHO develops a vaccine to coronavirus &amp; they refuse to share it with us because the President was mean? Are you going to send in the National Guard?
5074	108782	I wonder if O‚ÄôToole understands that it is Cons Premiers who are failing in the vaccine effort. If he does  then he is politicking and if he doesn‚Äôt he‚Äôs an idiot
5075	110024	OUR BEST CHANCE OF ENDING THIS PANDEMIC is to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to Covid-19 vaccines. No one is safe until everyone is safe. We need a #Peoplesvaccine NOW. #VaxForAllNow  #LAAdvocacyEM
5076	112858	Could say how the Coronavirus Vaccine is actually just a medical trial, But no one would say it's a experimental thing would they now?
5077	109623	Ah, it‚Äôs so refreshing that we no longer have a curfew in NYC and my neighborhood restaurants/bars and their very drunk patrons have single-handedly produced a covid-19 vaccine so everyone can fully party on the sidewalks like we‚Äôve got a whole block party today. #blessed
5078	111925	I couldn't imagine having a child in this time of the CoronaVirus but I do have grandchildren and my Son and Daughter-in-law are NOT sending the kids back into a classroom without a vaccine or cure! It's not just the kids but teachers and anyone they all come in contact with too.
5079	110182	I keep saying, I'll be glad when I get the microchip in my vaccine so I don't have to keep using the govt COVID-19 app to swipe into shops and cafes.
5080	108092	Completely taken out of context. Fauci said in April 2020, ‚ÄúIf ‚Äòback to normal‚Äô means acting like there never was a coronavirus problem, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population with a vaccine.‚Äù
5081	111727	@redthepianogirl Don't worry. We will get back to the good old days. COVID-19 Vaccines are coming later this year.
5082	108675	The world is racing to find a vaccine for #Covid19 -- but there's no vaccine for #ClimateChange. Tell the @ecb to stop financing big polluters and give us the #GreenRecovery our world needs. #Peoplenotpolluters
5083	110793	I treat my COVID-19 vaccine card just like my yellow vaccination card for my passport: BOTH are with my passport now.If you haven‚Äôt traveled internationally‚Ä¶some countries request/require additional vaccinations for your health.No one wants you to go home ill &amp; share story
5084	108371	If satan is real satan is the mf convincing stoopid people to not get the vaccine with baseless conspiracies
5085	109300	Maybe because cancer is more complex than the coronavirus... and there was an actual push to get the covid vaccine out so we can hopefully return to normal.
5086	112721	"Like I said the outrage about ""vaccine passports"" here is going to be so stupid.We really have got to stop coddling morons in this country."
5087	110367	@MattHancock I ‚ù§Ô∏è Christmas but far too much focus on this during pandemic with no vaccine yet! People must surely realise by now celebrations have to be scaled back to protect everyone.  Feel so sorry for retailers, hospitality, suppliers, hairdressers etcü§∂üèª
5088	110215	@mtgreenee America doesn't want to go back into lockdown is different than what we need to do. People like you who refuse to wear masks and refuse to take the vaccine is exactly why we have all these new mutations of COVID-19 going around. You're what is wrong with America, you're cancer.
5089	111019	Ya and this criminal has money in the vaccine he wants to make every one have so he gets even more rich just like Kill Gates!
5090	112467	I agree, @SenKamalaHarris. This will only get worse if we don‚Äôt take it more seriously. We need to ramp up testing. I‚Äôve also introduced legislation to make the #COVID19 vaccine free once it‚Äôs available.
5091	110985	@jimcramer The Covid-19 vaccines are not being tested against a saline placebo. All other drugs are; why is this an exception? To quote you, this is sub optimal! You need to do some research.
5092	112826	You know my anxiety during quarantine has spiked pretty hard but then I remember theres people out there who genuinely believe the earth is flat, vaccines cause illnesses and the Coronavirus is made from the government in the shape of 5G cell towers &amp; just like that I feel better
5093	109741	I just found out that my mom is going to get her COVID-19 vaccine next week and I am so so so so happy. üò≠ I have been beyond worried about her going in to work as nurse over these past months!
5094	109334	1) This virus has animal reservoirs meaning it can jump back and forth between humans and other hosts. So forget about we will eradicate this virus or COVIDzero2) Although our vaccines are very effective against severe #COVID19  they don't confer sterilizing immunity meaning...
5095	110678	I don't need a #coronavirus vaccine.My kids don't need it either.No microchip for me &amp; my family. The @WHO misled the world.-no human - human infection = ‚ùé-no animal infection = ‚ùé-not transmitted in air =‚ùé-virus can't survive long on surfaces outside human body =‚ùé
5096	112416	The whole story just stinks of politics. If the EU was so keen on having a proved, working vaccine, why don‚Äôt they get some from the Russians, too, and test, compare all the candidates?I‚Äôd say, follow the money, again.
5097	111942	There‚Äôs no vaccine, and next to zero chance they‚Äôve achieved herd immunity, so what‚Äôs the most likely outcome here?
5098	111429	Only way I can explain to 5yo my work is I make coronavirus vaccines (I don‚Äôt).Concept was surprisingly intuitive (he said it sounds like a trick to body) &amp; likened antibodies to a hospital. Let me take this oppty to üôè my @BARDA colleagues who toil 24/7 to advance Vx trials.
5099	201996	Calm down teachers; this whole masking of students has a super simple solution.Just take out all the desks and replace with restaurant tables and chairs, and then they no longer have to wear a mask.Done.#Covid19 #Vaccine #masks #MaskUP #SaturdayVibes
5100	109537	Walgreens in Big Chimney currently has extra Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.  First come, first served. Get there now. I was told the shots have to be thrown out when they close this evening.
5101	109254	@JKAMCHACHA @Phidze72 @mwwwn201 @SibandaSibbs @njabulodhlamin3 It‚Äôs worrying. That we have all these soldiers armed to the hilt among civilians in peacetime is worrying. Covid19 is a ruse, a pretext for a sinister motive. In a normal country there would be an inquest, but in Zimbabwe, it‚Äôs done, that‚Äôs it.
5102	108672	Well one would hope so ...  However if vaxxed people still get sick and still pass the virus along what good is it really??
5103	112532	üö® | NEW: A man has been arrested after getting the Coronavirus vaccine eight times, in order to get vaccine certification on behalf of other people
5104	111040	Why will it take Trump to convince Republicans to take the vaccine? Are they so daft? The mind boggles!!#COVID19 #DemVoice1 #COVID
5105	111165	@NixonandIke @ki676love @The_Burwel1 @WSJ Do you not understand how vaccines work?!?! A vaccine for COVID-19 Strain A will not necessarily work for COVID-19 Strain B.1.1.7. An example of this is the common Flu Vaccine. You don't get the same Flu vaccine each and every year...it varies with the types of flu strains.
5106	202166	LOLOLOLOLOL so I got this message from my job. I also have all three Covid-19 shots. The purpose of the vaccine is to reduce the symptoms of Covid-19, right? Why am I being told if I don‚Äôt show symptoms, I‚Äôm still expected to work and show up for my shifts until I show symptoms!?
5107	110464	"The truth on Corona virus vaccines  ""There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.""Why then is so much written about COVID vaccines?If a working vaccine is an unlikely event, then is it about the vaccine or something else?"
5108	112331	@TwitterLive Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
5109	108466	Done with #COVID19. Get a vaccine if you want, wear a mask if you want, but I‚Äôm going to do what I want. #feb1 #February2022 #covidover #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #followthescience
5110	108850	If there is a vaccine soon, there is absolutely no way the Trump deserves ANY credit for it.The world is working together on this and he has fought science the entire time.And anyway, wouldn‚Äôt you rather see it distributed by a Biden administration?#COVID19
5111	108192	It‚Äôs Happening Guys, There‚Äôs No Way Kenyan Government Is Being Given Free Covid19 Vaccines In Thousands Later They Get Expired Just Because Nanii Refused To Get Vaccinated. You‚Äôll Get The Jab By Force
5112	109377	"All the people whining they're not getting a vaccine because ""it's not approved"" will be whining that it was approved too fast, so they're not getting a vaccine.Just moving the goalposts. That's what they live for (at least till they get COVID because they didn't get a vaccine)"
5113	109651	So when are all these clever pharmaceutical companies going to produce a vaccine to the coronavirus. And before any clever clogs says not possible or wrong, the science has to come up with a solution
5114	108646	@DrOlufunmilayo My only question is , as it keeps mutilating does the present vaccine work also against the ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù version of Covid19 or they have to find a different vaccine ?
5115	201946	Received first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine today.  Let's all conquer the #pandemic together. #COVID19 #COVID #CovidVaccine #COVID19Vaccine
5116	108146	@CopingMAGA @tortellinius My father refuses to get the COVID-19 vaccine because he is 100% convinced that it's plot to microchip every American with the mark of the beast.
5117	109526	What if this a hoax  where he gets covid is hospitalized and low and behold he tries this new miracle drug and is well within a week.There you go vaccine for covid before Nov.3!!
5118	109318	@EWErickson Honestly, that‚Äôs a part of it. The stock market likes stability, and they think they‚Äôll get it with Yellin as Treasury Secretary. Plus the good news in a Covid-19 vaccine helped.

5120	110800	@LeonRDublin @ATschugguel @100trillionUSD Except you can't eradicate this virus even with a vaccine. It has animal reservoirs just like any coronavirus... It is here to stay like the common cold and flu. Proper treatments are the only option. This was never about your health or safety from a virus only control.ü§∑
5121	110177	Motherfuckers in my state are getting the coronavirus and thinking the vaccine will make them get autism.
5122	109549	@Togs100 @debbiebarnes66 After this vaccine there will still be covid rules. Safe distancing is here forever. Masks too. More vaccinations will follow. It‚Äôs a never ending ‚Äònew normal‚Äô. Those who know that the vaccine does not (can not) protect against coronavirus will at least be healthy -if less free.
5123	112572	Got my first COVID-19 vaccine today! I'll keep y'all updated on how I'm doing but feeling good right now. Get a vaccine right now if you can to protect yourself and others.
5124	107929	Why do I need to get a booster? Genuine question #COVID19 how will it help Dot over the road? She's had hers so why do I need mine??? @BorisJohnson I've never even had a cold so I reckon I might be ok since I've had the vaccine I've lost all motivation to exercise. coincidenceü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
5125	112095	@johnaw19 @leeburgess1 @DrGABaines @JuliaHB1 You said there has never been a vaccine for a similar virus. That is untrue. Flu is a coronavirus.

5127	112297	It is OK to me, not listen my words. But bad humans may die no matter how. Even they have done vaccine for coronavirus. Most of English belonging to David, King. And he is very severe and honest. Bad man have no place to live on earth.

5136	112876	This is awful! If people who are eligible would just do there part and get vaccinated, things like this wouldn‚Äôt happen. We need to get people vaccinated, continuous testing isn‚Äôt going to end this like O‚ÄôToole thinks. We need mandatory vaccines!
5137	111392	The African Continent has been catered to in regard by China. It is.... Only... China that has supplied WHO approved Vaccines to the African Continent. Racism has shown itself in the African Continent. Humanity has farted on the face of Human Beings. Ugh (La Ugh)
5138	202299	Yikes. Both soon-to-be-available vaccines for Covid19 come with side effects: Covid19-like symptoms that may last a day or so. BUT, to be effective, one must return and receive a 2nd dose. Lots of questions just ran through my mind üò≥. @CLupus63https://t.co/0Ec6l8RbRd
5139	112296	It's disappointing but I think making vaccines is probably kinda tricky, eh? I think we are better off being grateful for the miracles that we are getting and not act all super fucking entitled because there is a delay#covid19 #covid19ab
5140	111046	@NigelKellow @BethLynch2020 No at present there are 7 strains of COVID19,Is this vaccine a blanket for all 7 or just the common 2?

5141	109416	I know this is a very stupid question but please clear this out for me. Can someone who turned 18 this year get a COVID-19 vaccine? because this person is literally making fun of me saying ‚Äò18+ can get and I‚Äôm just 18‚Äô. I‚Äôm NOT DUMB but it‚Äôs confusing ü•∫üòÇ

5143	112434	Traitor trump...why is there a need for a vaccine for coronavirus when you told us ‚Äú it will just go away‚Äù?
5144	108450	The propaganda connected to their COVID-19 VACCINE became clear when they've said; 'people that have had #COVID19 already, can get it again.' But if you already have the COVID gene (antigen) in you, and they say you can get it again; then what good will their vaccine do. Its B$!
5145	111005	@BHRCSD The Coronavirus vaccine. The big pharma companies dont like Trump and waited till after the election to praise the vaccine. Biden will take credit for Trump's vaccine. Go figure!
5146	109174	@Debs_Kropotkin @DoubleA0317 @ADS21817949 @DrTomFrieden Vaccines prevent long Covid. No they might not stop it completely. But for me it‚Äôs enough that I am not worried about it.
5147	111193	The vaccine is around the corner, but we still need to be diligent in saving lives. Covid-19 has affected multiple people in my life, but recently it almost took a man that has been a father figure to me. Its also now touched on my immediate family and I have to be tested.

5182	109375	Last night I dreamt that I had gotten the covid-19 vaccineBill Gates has successfully chipped my dreams#covid #coronavirusireland #covidireland #coronavirus
5183	107825	It's not even that, how in the hell did they developed COVID-19 vaccine in months and not for HIV and Cancer still????It's frustrating.
5184	109371	Don't be appalled. It's only logical since the first vaccines were made without the Delta variant in mind, for example. Flu shots get renewed each year as well. It's just how it is.
5185	108816	Who thinks going on a cruise with unvaccinated people is smart? They have enough trouble passing around sickness as it is. This is crazy. Get your vaccine people!
5186	108318	.Oh dear what can the matter be....i think ive got sepsis.... in my anatomy.....i wish i studied..... endocrinology..... and politely declined my flu jab.
5187	111104	Sorry he did that. Hope he has no complications. I will never take a vaccine for a virus with a 99.7% survival. I have an idea...how about working on a vaccine for something that is actually deadly!
5188	111459	I support wearing #facemasks 100%. However, I'm puzzled. The #vaccine will be less effective protection? How come? This is troubling news.
5189	111959	@elonmusk @AstroJordy @erujabidi It looks like a severe seasonal virus or sars which is a common coronavirus but obviously it is not covid.Treatment of seasonal virus &amp; sars is very different from covid treatment...A misdiagnosis is the worst!Trust your gut,your vibes!If DayQuil rocks,it's ok!‚úåÔ∏èGet well soon!üíï
5190	109044	Well pinhead Harris, Trump will not be the one that says the vaccine is safe. I‚Äôm sure the vaccine makers will be the ones who say when the vaccine is safe.
5191	202251	This is utter BS. Both my parents voted for Brexit and have had their first vaccine jab. I too voted for Brexit and will be more than happy to have the jab.Studies like these do nothing but sprea division through an already divided country.
5192	110412	"@LilithAssyria @Kevin_McKernan Afaik, they have never isolated the original Wuhan virus, but they have many times isolated the virus from probes taken out of patients directly. It grows in vitro.The problem no ""real virus"" coronavirus vaccine exists is ADE (Antibody dependent enhancement)"
5193	108807	Anti vaxxers have had enough time, it‚Äôs time that they show us their empirical facts/evidence/research as to why they don‚Äôt want the vaccine to protect themselves and those around them.
5194	111545	"Alright I've taken the ""third (second in my case) does"" of COVID-19 vaccine.  This time I've got the Pfizer. I'll say it once again. Please do vaccinate. It's the only way we can truly live normally again.#TeamPfizer"
5195	108319	@hrshta_k Makes sense, why would they apply when the vaccines are not destined to be used there. But I don‚Äôt see this will ever happen. They should just allow based on the confidence they have on the vaccine and how it works on COVID-19
5196	110408	@tannerkahler @WISN12News @GovEvers @ABC @ABCNewsLive There have been how many strains of COVID since it was first discovered in animals in the 1930s. Explain why in h. there has not been a single vaccine? Why is there no vaccine for the common cold since it is related to coronavirus strains? Corporate profits over public safety.
5197	109073	i had to get all my shots to go to school in 1990my brother had to get them in 1994 or maybe 1995.and my nephew had to get them last yearwe're hoping the covid19 vaccine for under 12s comes soon
5198	109123	@MikeMcLean123 @peterson1115 @GovBillLee I had the flu every year until I started getting the flu shot every year it works I am listening to the science I've gotten both shots for covid19 and I will get the flu shot next month and I will get a booster shot if the science tells me to my Drs said so!!
5199	112202	This is a negative piece of news but on the other hand it shows that their research is very serious and there is no doubt that when the vaccine is finally approved, it is going to be safe!
5200	107758	"@MattHancock I'm not anti vaccine far from it but seems to me that so far in Europe only totalitarian states R willing to inject vaccines prematurely to get PR benefit. "" they're  old &amp; will soon be dead anyway"".  NO doubt Trump would've the same if reelected. Shameful #RejoinEU"
5201	111628	It is official the country is screwed. When your vaccines Minister doesn't even know the order in which the months of the year run then you really do start to understand how this Government have made such a complete hash of their response to Covid19.
5202	112586	Of course this #virus was on purpose, it‚Äôs China testing the world. To see how we can cope , see how long it takes for us to get #COVID19  #vaccines . The next virus will be deadlier , Hey presto ! China controls the World
5203	108417	IF the #CovidVaccine works,IF #Masks works,IF all the measures by BIduMB work, then why the hell am I at home with #COVID19 ?My Grandfather has #Covid, my hubby, again #Covid, my Gen Z kid, #COVID19Get it RIGHT! #COVIDIOTS#GetVaccinatedNow ü§¨üñï
5204	110820	i saw a tiktok on how the coronavirus vaccine works. they put covid rna in it so when it gets into your bloodstream a protein will make a cell with covid antigens and then your body is like hello stranger and starts making antibodies against it.
5205	108019	"Vaccines don't stop infection. None of them do, not one. They charge the immune system to fight an infection. You'd think all these useful idiots screaming ""Believe the ScIeNcE!!!"" might actually be interested in learning the science. #COVID19"

5208	111014	@VictoriaSykes1 @AilsaJanePodMed Saw this convo and wanted to share this thread. It‚Äôs not surprising those on ocrevus like us have little to no B cell antibodies from vaccine but our T cells mount an effective response that is not measured in these antibodies tests.

5210	112250	Another NACI leak. I realize the advisory council has had communications issues, but I don‚Äôt get why this stuff is leaking, and how a leak is helpful for shoring up public trust around a vaccine that is already facing hesitancy.Also: NACI just cancelled today‚Äôs press conference
5211	109759	@Birds_WatArtThy @PrefectDreyfus @FamilyTrumpGolf @KiingAP12 @Josh112214 @donutrolls15 or a vaccine &amp; good treatment. we don't know enough about the long-term effects of COVID-19 but what we do know is it's bad and can lead to life-long damages to your body.hopefully, when you get COVID-19 you're actually immune for years after but we don't know that for certain.
5212	111076	It's only midday and my brain is already hurting from the Covid-19 conspiracy theorists#microchip#markofthedrvil#billgates#dnachangevaccineStrangely enough, the twats have given up on the 5G theory.
5213	111817	@LizClaman It‚Äôs laughable to think with the vaccine progress made by Pfizer, Moderna, and Oxford that anyone will need a vaccine by @PeterHotez- plus given how little support this will get relative to OWS his best hope for real shots in arms is mid-2022
5214	111394	So why should kids get the vaccine if this virus gives them no symptoms?? Most didn‚Äôt even get a fever!!
5215	108119	These claims are because there seems to be 2 Pfizer vaccines.This is partly true. The vaccine will be delivered in 2 different packagings, 1 that is branded, ‚ÄúComirnaty,‚Äù and 1 called Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The actual vaccine in either package is EXACTLY the same.
5216	109075	Soon they'll be shooting and killing anyone not taking their stupid vaccines. They are just preparing us.
5217	111241	@DearAuntCrabby I won't be taking any vaccine because I did my research this covid19 is being survived by 98% of those who contract it not mentioning viruses aren't really good candidates to be vaccinated against as they mutate quickly

5225	109779	Why third and fourth when there is treatment. They said. If you take 2 dose pfz,  you are safe, then second lie you may get infected but mild. Then why third booster? Time to ponder.
5226	110907	@v_cassiere @waltshaub Follow Covid-19 precautions, encourage others to do do, get flu vaccine as soon as possible encourage others to do so, volunteer (if able to safely) for voter registration efforts, polling locations, peaceful protests, research what's needed locally and engage as best you can.
5227	109449	Sounds like child abuse to me‚Ä¶ way to go (mom) when he gets sick you will beg for the vaccine to be pulled right?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
5228	109210	@Textingdaddy @julie44627826 @Reuters Hate to break it to you but the common flu could have been wiped out with everyone getting a flu #vaccine, but here we are 80 years later with the flu running a muck every year. #COVID19 is most here to stay. It‚Äôs estimated that 30% of the population won‚Äôt get the vaccine.
5229	111039	@KENS5 All of my immediate family has had the coronavirus. Those with the vaccine all contracted the coronavirus they received the shot for immunity.
5230	109829	@JaggerMickOZ Nowhere in this document is there any mention of responses to ‚Äòno jab no job.  Rather, the sentiment is to augment the frontline workers who are burdened by the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases in VIC.  If this augmentation covers some staff resigning, so be it.

5236	110862	@FredeckyB1 By treating it like a real pandemic, mask protocols, shutdowns, social distancing,  they work broadly for any virus, just because there isn't a specific to this virus solution doesn't mean there isn't a solution, also coronavirus vaccines were in development before the pandemic
5237	110307	@OutdoorCrypto @MadDogCoops @JoeyAnselmini @schadnfr @Rover829 @niro60487270 He‚Äôs too stupid to realize they‚Äôre using MERS strains to find a vaccine for the new coronavirus or any other

5239	111082	damn what happened to the mink coronavirus? I know they culled minks in a lot of European countries because of the mutation that makes vaccines less effective against it. Is the mink coronavirus strain really gone? It could show up in the US like the UK variant.
5240	108780	@EliseVelaz9 @busdriverlife I was contemplating this, but then I realized that about half of the vaccines we‚Äôve ever had, I have no idea how severe the disease would be. These dieseases barely register In my brain. I‚Äôd like COVID-19 to be that way for the next generation.
5241	109459	Just dropped my folks off to get their vaccine! Couldn‚Äôt be happier! I caught Covid back in September but never passed it on to them even though we all live in the same house! No idea how that happened! #COVID19 #COVIDVaccination

5255	110022	@StopNewNormal The magical vaccine again that ignores the uncomfortable truth.- We've never developed one for a coronavirus- They normally take 10 years to be safe- No 100% effective (Flu is ~30%)- It'll be over before we need it. No-one has a Spanish flu vaccine (it's not needed).
5256	108629	@dicey_armaney @POTUS Why do you think un vaccinated people don't take covid-19 seriously? That's a bit presumptuous.  Perhaps some are afraid the vaccine will actually kill them because they are very immuno-compromised. Food for thought
5257	111625	@Jenkinsonn3 no. i don't think the vaccines are 100% safe either, but covid really is so dangerous, especially when it comes to collapsing healthcare systems, that they're a necessary, or atleast i hope so. i also believe covid19 was an accident.
5258	110062	@DailyMirror Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

5261	110965	@superscuba83 @Mrs_Thomas82 Don‚Äôt lose hope. It‚Äôs a cold virus, not flu, so not expected to mutate as freq. Science have never moved this quickly towards creating a successful vaccine for Coronavirus as colds are generally mild, &amp; previous outbreaks of sars covid fizzled out.

5264	112466	@OliviuG @LaloDagach The vaccine originally being developed for SARS (SARS-CoV-1) is now being used as the basis for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
5265	109714	@FactsMathLogic Well after the peak of h1n1 they developed a vaccine. These are two different pandemics. Fact is there was immunities older folks had that others didnt. This one no one has immunity or antibodies it is a novel coronavirus.
5266	202431	My guess was at least 80% of each community sub-group, so I guess I was (unfortunately) pretty close.  #CovidVaccine

5268	111833	@BBCBreakfast It looks like the EU is going ahead with blocking of Covid-19 vaccines? This just shows what hold the EU Commission has on its members as quite a few of them were against these moves. They are only doing this because the UK has left the Union and that we are so far
5269	111323	Another way the Dems are dictating to us. No vaccine, no job, no income to punish us for not obeying their laws üò° Why aren't our Repub reps fighting back??? üò° Are they part of the Deep State manuevering us to their NWO??? üò°üò°üò°

5277	111770	"Covid-19 isn't a hoax. The hoax is THIS; ""the only way to control it is a vaccine."" The vaccine is one way. there are other cures. The media and Government has convinced us that the only way to control its spread is the vaccine. THIS IS A LIE."
5278	111351	What you fail to understand is that people will get sick either way. Your suggestion that we close everything down until the vaccine is distributed(which can take another year) People will get sick the best we can do is get as many vaccines and also up our hospital capacity.
5279	108560	This makes me wonder. @realDonaldTrump gave endless briefings about ventilators. And we come to find out they weren‚Äôt necessary. In fact whistleblowers said they were actually killing people! Is the vaccine truly the new ventilator? Will it go unused because it‚Äôs dangerous? ü§î

5281	109777	@EdTufexis @JKPreachersgirl The *scientific twitter experts* are saying it could be the stronger symptoms some are having may indicate they would have had more severe Coronavirus. Doesn't make sense to me, *pretend twitter science expert*, because there is no coronavirus in the vaccine.

5283	109927	If covid19 is really sensitive to summer heat, I am sure people will do whatever they can to postpone winter as much as they can, even if it took them to burn down all forests and open all factories or release every single carbon dioxide molecule. Vaccine will save us and Earth!
5284	110254	@tentacle_tattoo that‚Äôs kind of my thinking, the worst thing the vaccine can do is give you coronavirus (even tho it doesn‚Äôt actually contain the virus but let‚Äôs just assume dumb shit)but you could also get coronavirus, which will do all the same stuff but 100x worse

5296	110784	These same people seem not to realize that we do not have vaccines for ANY, of the past pandemics, not H1N1, not AIDS (which is a Coronavirus). What idiot thinks wearing masks and social distancing is going to go on indefinitely? I still say it all goes away, Nov 4th.

5301	201999	Awesome day today having a delayed #CanadaDay BBQ outdoor get together with some of our neighbours. Everyone has at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, some (myself, yay!) have both doses. Looking forward to when us fully vaccinated get back to normal in British Columbia.
5302	112482	Is it true the AstraZeneca Oxford #COVID19 vaccine is not being tested against an inert placebo but against a meningococcal vaccine?Why? Because it hides side-effects.
5303	202388	Fully fully vaxxed (2 weeks after my second dose today) with nearly 12,000 lovely COVID-19 antibodies. Definitely feeling much freer now and not using my sanitiser every 5 mins to the point that my hands go all dry, flaky, &amp; horrible.Yes to freedom and yes to the vaccines üôåüèª https://t.co/ozti6mJqsS
5304	112486	@Godnose @fragrantfeline @ClarkeMicah there's no vaccine against the common cold, another coronavirus, but they tell us they can rush one through that'll defo work and be safe.
5305	109500	@nytimes China only stamped out the coronavirus on their fake report. Without the cure, without the vaccine, there's no way to stamp the virus out. If you are positive but asymptomatic there, you're not counted as a confirmed case.
5306	111557	@Blacklace40 The only way I'll consent to a vaccination is when I see the effects of the vaccine on white people like you because I'm not about to be a guinea pig. My fear is  due to COVID-19 impacting Blk Ppl in high percentages, they'll use us as test subjects. I'll pass. It'll be a while
5307	112585	This is something logical, but is government going to wait till vaccine developed? or what would be the strategy to maintain minimum speading of virus.#lcokdown has shown us complete failure of administration control so far.#SpeakUpIndia #coronavirus @ndtv @MoHFW_INDIA
5308	112706	Got my second covid-19 vaccine. Countdown started until my two weeks are done. Woo hoo!#covid19 #CovidVaccine
5309	108354	I believe in vaccination for poor countries. But I‚Äôm honestly sick of seeing these articles already. It‚Äôs üíØ ethical for countries that developed the vaccines to provide it to their populations first. If in 6 months poor countries aren‚Äôt getting it then I will be upset.
5310	112390	The spread in India is absolutely gnarly. The juxtaposition of everyone getting vaccines here, and the rapid spread there is crazy. #mavorg
5311	111748	One nation in the world has decided to use Covid-19 and vaccines as a weapon, it'll come as no surprise to find out who it is.
5312	108494	@berniespofforth I'm not a vegan.My vaccines are all up-to-date.My kids' vaccines are all up-to-date.I will take a COVID19 vaccine as soon as it is made available to me (I'm moderate risk as I am 50 and had lymphoma a few years back).Anyone that doesn't take vaccines is an entitled cunt IMO.
5313	110501	If you want to understand how something will play out in the future, all you need to do is look into the past.Current #Covid19 vaccines don't reportedly prevent infections, only lower the severity of symptoms and complications if you get it. #VirusTheater NPIs are here to stay.

5319	111259	@fourscoreand6 @JennaEllisEsq Meh, the vaccine has done nothing to save lives, and those who dont take it are no more or less a risk to others who do take it.there is no vaccine for coronavirus. If there was we would have cured the common cold.
5320	110252	@muffnbear We need scientists to work overtime to create a vaccine for this so the antivaxxers worried about coronavirus can not take it.

5323	109718	Channel 3 in Thailand is reporting a Thai doctor has found a cure for Novel Coronavirus. It says he uses 3 vaccines:  1. Oseltamivir. This vaccine for MERS  2. Lopinavir This for AIDS  3. Ritonavia. For AIDS #journalism #Health #Wuhan #China # #media #Thailand #Coronavirus
5324	111088	This is most likely propaganda but even if it wasn‚Äôt, why wouldn‚Äôt you just share vaccine information so everyone can have it? People are dying.
5325	112606	In my view, there is a lot of fear among Christians masquerading as prudence or caution, especially as it relates to COVID-19 and the vaccines. David‚Äôs declaration is good advice today: ‚ÄúWhen I am afraid, I will trust in you.‚Äù (Psalm 56:3)
5326	110119	No. They don't work against Covid. The vaccines are the reason we have variants happening. Our immune systems could wipe out COVID-19 in time.
5327	108812	Mandates are not laws. Why this vaccine and none of the others? Chickenpox, Influenza, hepatitis, etc? Why not all vaccines in order to work? What is so special about this one? If you can still get and spread #COVID19. All the other vaccines work! Mandates are not laws.
5328	111329	Why on earth wasn‚Äôt this publicized? Seems like a great PSA opportunity for vaccines, especially when 56% of Republicans won‚Äôt or are unsure about getting vaccine.
5329	112389	@ed_hooven @NBSaphierMD Like I said, you clearly don't understand how vaccines work. If you did you'd understand ppl who have had covid19 don't need a vaccine.
5330	110688	The Market is acting as if Intramuscular #COVID vaccines are all we need - this year perhaps / next year the nasal route will eliminate the need for mask wearing in those taking $ALT vaccine - strategic advantage.
5331	109292	@Breaking911 Why the rush to vaccinate so many people with an experimental vaccine when most of us have this thing called an immune system &amp; if your healthy you will beat the coronavirus on your own. There are also CURES aka therapeutics- so vaccines are not needed, ppl need to wake up.
5332	109745	I am fully vaccinated. But an injection the WHO needed to change the definition of ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù for is actually no vaccine!!! #Booster #coronavirus #virus #COVID19 #Impfstoff #vaccine
5333	111785	Please @PramilaJayapal tell me again how great unions are. We pulled our kids out of SPS because it couldn't handle Covid. We're going to an independent school where vaccine and masks are mandated. We're lucky we can afford this option. Most cannot. But unions.
5334	111273	@Telegraph Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
5335	111971	If a vaxxed person can get covid, and spread covid, then why would it be so important for healthcare workers to be vaxxed???
5336	107951	@Elisabe88429520 @JeremyVineOn5 @dr_simon @theJeremyVine Im not worried about the planed covid19 never have been the vaccines don't work the booster is to make money off us they admitted it.

5339	111338	If a #vaccine is to expose us to a virus in hopes our bodies create antibodies, then wouldn't our bodies already be doing this now assuming most of us have been in contact with the #virus?Therefore, why do we need a vaccine? #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS

5345	108155	@punditclass This is not the flu.  The reason why? Because if you get COVID-19 there is a chance you could have severe outcomes either short term (death) I guess natural immunity would not matter in this case, or long term. Both more severe than the vaccine.
5346	109431	@wanthiskookaine @MrMcChicken22 @travisyost @washingtonpost A virus can weaken but it doesn‚Äôt have to. CoVid-19 is a novel virus but flu sometimes mutates to become deadly (except that we have vaccines to mitigate the risk and spread). Even if the bits of science were strung together in a truthful way‚Ä¶the timeline would still be unknown
5347	111155	@QuestionEvery31 @3Hams1 @choo_ek Your logic is broken. Between 81% and 96% of recent coronavirus patients requiring in-patient care received no COVID-19 vaccine or are only partially vaccinated. They‚Äôre not overwhelming our health care system yet, but they prob will soon
5348	110540	@praecipice @AndySwan @YossiGestetner @RonColeman At this point, yes. Maybe better vaccines will come along that are sterilizing for SARS-CoV-2, but that's not likely for any coronavirus. The vaccines are now 100% leaky. Hell, in my province, you have fewer chances to get COVID now by 30% if you are unvaccinated.
5349	112600	@IngrahamAngle I said earlier, how come China with the world's largest population has had fewer Covid-19 infections than Chicago?  Jeez, are they lying about it or did they have a vaccine in place before they released the virus on the world? Asking for a friend in Wuhan.
5350	110484	@senatemajldr Mitch please.Politicians have NOTHING 2 do with a vaccine. Scientists created it, not republicans. And you've got some nerve talking about baselessly undermining science. U enabled Trump 2 do JUST THAT since covid-19 started. Not 2 mention u don't believe in climate change...
5351	111337	No one is safe until everyone is safe   When you get the chance, take the vaccine.  Thank you UKG and Oxford AstraZeneca.
5352	110758	@AndrewBartlett So if the employee is unvaxxed, they could potentially sue the employer if they caught #COVID19 in the workplace, as the employer had a duty of care to protect them. Sometimes laws have to be made to protect people from their own stupidity, like safety goggles and hard hats.
5353	107939	Can we all stop being fake outraged over members of our govt getting the #CovidVaccine already?  Is it a dick hypocritical move to be an #antimasker #COVID19 downplaying vaccine getter? Yes. They are govt though and if them getting it encourages their constituents, good! Move on!
5354	112011	Just imagine when the vaccine comes out. The right will protest that too. These idiots are the reason why cases go up and we can't get out of this mess. the curfew is 10pm-5am. what would you be doing anyway?

5360	109122	@cfrizz99 @wrstlrboy03 @HugS86 @AchatGBA We can if it‚Äôs not the first coronavirus. We‚Äôve had vaccine technology for similar viruses in the work since 2011. With all the funding, we were able to develop and release a vaccine quicker not because it isn‚Äôt tested, but because we can skip all the legal stuff
5361	112909	Question to you is how long u gonna wait like this? Is the human life on earth will be dependent on one vaccine (profit for Pharma co) after another? Or we wish to defeat it by inherent immune sys?

5375	112224	@angie_rasmussen @BogusLobster When you have healthcare for all then you're going to get a country that is going to treat its citizens with the utmost respect and everyone will get the covid-19 vaccine. The US should be ashamed of itself. The US needs to have Healthcare for all and free vaccines for all.
5376	110684	@rongejman I agree, but there hasn't been a global effort like this to work on a vaccine for one virus since maybe polio. Also, we know that it is possible to make vaccines for coronaviruses in general. See Merck's canine coronavirus vaccine.
5377	111803	ü§£ And all the mask addicts will STILL get the vaccine, STILL wear the mask and STILL obey the lockdowns.  You see where they're going with this?  Anyone continuing to follow these mandates are suckers.
5378	110127	@EthonRaptor @leahstokes Wife can't have vaccine.  I will test 1st. Someone else may need it. Don't want to deny them if I don't need it.  Have has over 20 exposures, may have had mild case. Or, I may be in the approx 1/3 who have immunity because of coronavirus cold.
5379	109769	A Russian health care regulator has become the first in the world to approve a vaccine against the coronavirus, President Vladimir V. Putin said, though the vaccine has yet to complete clinical trials.
5380	109289	@globalnews I will likely wait to see. This will be an extremely rushed vaccine with little to no testing as normally required. Plus there has yet to be a successful vaccine for any previous coronavirus strain (SARS, MERS) so how have they suddenly come up with one now?

5383	111549	@Ramshaofficial Please don't do it.  1.  It is not a vaccine.  It is an RNA modifier which will change your bodies reaction to the next coronavirus exposure,  possibly creating a cytokine storm (an autoimmune response where your bodies defense system attacks the body).
5384	109162	@FT I read the article as isn‚Äôt proven that the vaccine will actually work. ‚ÄúThe negotiations came as an international battle escalates among rich countries to buy up coronavirus remedies, often long before their effectiveness has been confirmed‚Äù.

5416	108892	So let me get this straight we are going to let criminals out if they get the vaccine to protect people from COVID. So how are we going to protect people from their criminal actions again.
5417	109429	Can someone explain why these numbers chose to go down and stay stable with all these tarvens open? Or ke vaccine?üòÇ
5418	108879	So many people have taken the COViD-19 vaccine - over 150 million in the world, and nearly 1 million in Nigeria. Vaccine has not connected them to 5G, it has not put a chip in them. I have taken the vaccine, my parents ve too. We have not turned to zombie. @KNSMOH @KanoChronicle
5419	107971	@scotgovhealth The NHS online service for coronavirus vaccine certification does not work. Having to call. Currently 255th in queue. Get it sorted out. This all because there was no thought to put a QR code on a letter like everywhere else did. Shambles.
5420	111291	@tradetraderson @HannaMontona @Q10Of @WillyWonkaXRP I do.Besides, the flu (another coronavirus) has been around for over 100 years and we still don't have an effective vaccine against it-and it ain't mandatory either
5421	112608	Yeah they definitely gonna mandate this vaccine for COVID-19 we all say we not gonna take it but they gonna take all the privileges away No flying, Working, etc watch
5422	107690	Yeahhhh thanks but no thanks. I‚Äôm staying inside until I either get the vaccine or complete Breath of the Wild 2, whichever comes first.

5428	202119	I'm happy that some of my friends are vaccinated but It's uncomfortable to see the disparity of vaccine between the West and the rest. I'm working with collaborators in Central, South East, South Asia. COVID-19 situations have not calmed down, with the second and third waves.
5429	112214	@nastystacface @zibilith @TRyanGregory Hi, Stacey. There isn‚Äôt a vaccine for Covid for dogs right now. There is a Coronavirus vaccine often included with the DHPP vaccine - often written as DHPPCvk. That is a vaccine against a coronavirus, but not Covid. It‚Äôs a virus that causes diarrhea.
5430	108424	@Steveofhope Exactly! And not everyone has the flu vaccine as low risk groups don‚Äôt need it, which will more than likely be the same situation when the Coronavirus one is available. We have herd immunity against flu as well.
5431	109224	You see how they're not making the vaccine accessible? They're only open during bank hours and they are acting like the pandemic is over. It's literally not people's fault they aren't vaccinated.
5432	109878	@ianhanomansing I got a call this morning from my doctor's office &amp; they are Only offering the Pfizer Vaccine... So yes I am going to take it bust mostly coz it's got the highest success rates out of all Covid19 Vaccinations
5433	108429	The user says when a #coronavirus vaccine comes to the market #Iran officials will be the first to secure it for themselves, then they will shout that our nation is not ready to lose its honor just for a vaccine.
5434	108941	This is such a joke!   No one cares, Don!Trump voters are not concerned about coronavirus, so they won‚Äôt get the vaccine.   Biden voters don‚Äôt trust Trump and his non-science based vaccine, so they won‚Äôt get the vaccine.

5437	109674	@adam_casto Yeah, supposedly if I shelter in place and wear a mask when I go outside it's going to destroy my immune system or something. That's what the lady that talks about the 5G microchips in the coronavirus vaccines anyway.

5440	108299	@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Just because there is no vaccine right now for the Coronavirus. It doesn't mean it's our President's fault. I can think of No Greater President to take care of this than him. I sure wouldn't want the tree hugger Bernie Sanders to take care of this!!!!!

5446	110234	If you‚Äôre in an area that has Kaiser Health, they are giving the Covid-19 vaccine to non members.  It‚Äôs not commonly known, so you might want to give them a call, 65 and older in California.
5447	108028	Yay! So happy for your staff who got their COVID-19 vaccines today.You‚Äôve all been so amazing to work with throughout this pandemic. You‚Äôve been there for us often with efficiency in swabbing those on isolation with no transportation, &amp; enmasse in care homes. #Gratefulüíú
5448	111617	So @micro_outdoor has been running anti-vax ads on billboards here in Morgantown for months. They are still going strong, just waiting for their chance to further endanger my community by keeping  folks from getting a covid19 vaccine once it's available.
5449	109079	Good news comes from the US in the first phase trial of an ongoing vaccine to stop the coronavirus-spread pandemic Kovid-19. The first corona vaccine trials conducted here on humans have yielded very positive results.

5451	111884	Please don't take this vaccine ! These globalists do not care about anyone! They drove you from your land in 1800's please don't take vaccine
5452	110627	@ImMissAdorable The only important vaccine for Covid-19 is the one you can get in to you asap. Pondering a preference for one over others isn't very bright... if it's approved and available, take it.
5453	107817	it's a failure then isn't it if you can still get it and spread it that in my book is a failing vaccine
5454	110059	@ohmoses I believe in vaccinations but wouldn't get a CoronaVirus vaccine. They take years to make, not months. I'd rather stay home.
5455	110171	@DoeFkin @realAdrianLight We've been dealing with coronavirus and mRNA stuff for awhile and it's not new. The specific vaccine is but unless there's actually Kree blood in it, were not dealing with a fresh and new technology

If Americans risk their and the life of others for their republican brain disease, we need to give the vaccines to The Who to get forward. In the end we will reach herd immunity. Stop COVID-19

5470	110768	I'm waiting for the data first because the last efficacy data showed about 65%, so this would have to be a big jump, but assuming this is true the pandemic will be on its way out-Oxford vaccine much cheaper and easier to distribute than competitors
5471	112634	@Nancy_H1122 @RealCandaceO Just because you get the vaccine doesn't ensure you wont die from it. You can still get COVID19 &amp; you can still die EVEN if you have the vaccine. You can still get the flu even if you get the flu shot!!You're an idiot if you actually believe you wont die because u got the jab!
5472	109970	I‚Äôve run pivotal studies, there‚Äôs nothing routine about pausing one. Unclear how they‚Äôll determine this isn‚Äôt vaccine related. Underscores why we can‚Äôt rush a vaccine &amp; need long term data before rolling out... Hoping for the best. Also hoping this serves as a cautionary tale
5473	111694	No one should oblige you legally to take the covid-19 vaccine, this is a violation against one‚Äôs free will &amp; personal freedom. It is criminal that getting vaccinated is mandatory instead of optional. It is our physical bodies and we are free with it. #BeOnlyConcernedAboutYourSelf
5474	112091	@nycke1975 @littlecreep75 @FoxNews My distrust of the vaccine doesn't care who is president. It's based on my own knowledge of how poorly the trials are run. I will take my chance with the 99.5% survival if I happen to get Covid-19

EVER.

5524	109536	@danwootton @RossjournoClark Why does no one listen to the experts? Its a coronavirus. This is a variation of the common cold not a flu. A vaccine will only help 50%. Any immunity fades after a short time. There can be no herd immunity without a vaccine.
5525	110810	@KingGeorgeNY @John_Gkinis25 @MAGAPATRIOT34 @EtherealRose456 @NYGovCuomo FFS!!

Aldo it will take years before covid19 infects enough ppl to have herd immunity. Why are so many Americans so dumb??
5526	109704	@thehill Then make sure they don‚Äôt get the vaccine until everyone else does first. And insurance companies shouldn‚Äôt cover any of their COVID-19 expenses for this reckless behavior.
5527	108471	@Reuters Why? Every vaccinated person can contract and spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The vaccine is said to only protect the vaccinated person against severe symptoms of Covid-19 disease ‚Äî not against catching the virus. Any vaccine requirement for travel is insane.

5530	108139	This is why the @Pfizer potion is NOT a vaccine.  NO ANTIGEN is contained therein.  Same for #Moderna.The potion uses manmade mRNA to reprogram human cells to make the protein which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies.What could possibly go wrong?

5533	111189	Sounds like they understand the vaccine really doesn‚Äôt protect us from shit, it‚Äôs never gonna end, &amp; mutations will keep happening. Now they‚Äôre talking about 3 rounds of booster shots. Why? because they know it‚Äôs not going away. Vaccine or not. Boosters or not.

5535	110836	I know the virus is real I know the vaccine will help a lot of people but I am not taking the vaccine remember I am scientist and I do things for a reason because nobody not going to tell me what the f*** to do
5536	107996	"Why kids say #WearAMask üò∑: ""Coronavirus has hurt all of us. I hate missing school. All of us are wearing masks. Not sure when kids can get the vaccine. I hope it‚Äôs soon.‚Äù -- Lauren, 12 (6/7)"
5537	111843	If the vaccine produces 100% immunity, as the Mayo Clinic states, then it would prevent kids from spreading it because they wouldn't have it in the first place.
5538	112252	No biggie - just healthy, athletic kids being struck down w/ heart damage from unnecessary vaccines.Don‚Äôt exercise for a month after getting the vaccine kids, &amp; all will be well apparently. Being a couch potato is good for you.@fordnation @TOPublicHealth @PublicHealthON @tdsb
5539	108881	Stop this nonsense. You fooled us enough @BBCWorld @CNBCTV18Live @CNN @WSJ @nytimes @business @Reuters @jpmorgan @CLSAInsights @IIFLMarkets @NileshShah68 @hdfcmf just to keep markets up they either talk of stimulus or of vaccines. While in reality we r in recession #coronavirus 2
5540	110354	You think the travel industry, like airlines, for example, would require vaccinations because more people would feel comfortable flying and that's good for the bottom line. Like I don't understand why they don't require vaccines or a negative COVID-19 test.
5541	108840	i think if anyone is immune to the coronavirus it would be steve-o, scientists should use his blood for a vaccine immediately
5542	109113	We don‚Äôt need a vaccine, we need to strength our immune systems (eat organic NO GMO), make sure you have enough vitamins D &amp; C (second stage of covid is actually acute scurvy). Practice good personal hygiene. I wouldn‚Äôt trust any vaccine now esp knowing what Billy Gates
5543	108245	It took the election of democrat @JoeBiden to get the vaccine out the door. Good job, Joe!Vote blue in GA to keep the good news coming! #gapol
5544	112286	If you don't believe the medical profession about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, then please be consistent and stay home when you get sick.  The hospital would just treat you with the medical science you're ignoring.
5545	108186	Sooooooooooooo, you think a president has a power to command us to take a vaccine that might be dangerous?Would you be so gung ho if this was Trump commanding YOU to take that vaccine?Inquiring minds want to know.
5546	111916	This is the game changer - it is vastly cheaper then the 2 dose vaccines, easily distributed and administered. It may be lagged behind in terms of supply to Canada but has incredible possibilities for managing infection in the general population. #greatnewsonafriday
5547	111086	@yesnicksearcy @OutNow45 NOVEL coronavirus. The fact that our vaccines show any efficacy against strains that didn't exist until after they were created, trialed, and submitted for EUA is impressive. Their mRNA platform will also minimize turnaround for new versions if needed.Great indeed.
5548	107924	The coronavirus vaccines will probably prevent you from getting sick with Covid-19. But it‚Äôs not yet clear whether you can still get infected asymptomatically and silently spread the virus.-NYT
5549	108217	I know it‚Äôs easy to panic when these headlines come across our timelines, but an entire arsenal of vaccine candidates is slowly building up.Shots on goal approach has never been more valuable than it is right now. Hopefully this is just a bump in the road for one candidate.
5550	112737	And that's why my kids will not go to school until there is a vaccine, or a robust testing and contact tracing plan is fully enacted.  #KeepSchoolsClosed
5551	108684	Just signed up for my #COVID19 vaccine ‚Äî it was possibly the easiest thing I‚Äôve ever done.  My appointment is in 2 days. It‚Äôs a shame @NHDems spent so much time and effort trying to undermine public confidence in the process.Don‚Äôt be dissuaded ‚Äî get the vaccine! #nhpolitics
5552	110187	And this is the vaccine garbage they are going to force our health  care workers to have,Not in my name,Not in the name of our Conservative party,Health secretary,and not in the name of British Law
5553	202340	Pfizer/BionTech COVID-19 vaccine trial results: 20k got the vaccine. Only 8 of those got COVID. 20k got a placebo.162 got Covid, but only 3 got ‚Äòsevere‚Äô Covid and only 1 was hospitalized.
5554	110336	COVID-19 vaccine. Why isn‚Äôt it frozen when they open the freezer? How do you inject something that cold ?
5555	112333	Can‚Äôt we please wait until every child get their Covid-19 vaccine done before we allow them to attend normal schooling? @DrAdhamBaba @DGHisham PdPR exist because of that, aren‚Äôt they?
5556	111257	"""@realDonaldTrump Tantruming Trump, """"Damn that Coronavirus. Ruined my stock market. Now my polls are down. I gotta get a vaccine. Wait, I dont even give my kids vaccines.

5557	109560	@realDonaldTrump Why do they need a covid-19 Bill if the vaccine is basically ready. you said during the last debate it was going to be about two weeks after the election and we would have a vaccine, so where is that?
5558	108632	@BleacherNation I‚Äôve heard of this outside of covid19 too. I‚Äôd be ok with that. No way am I attending games until there‚Äôs a vaccine
5559	109563	No! No so called COVID-19 vaccine for me. I value my health and my liberty and freedom. That vaccine is poison and will be used to know where anyone is during their last days.
5560	110276	@MihrThakar Can you choose which arm you get the COVID-19 vaccine in?The answer is a simple yes. Just like any other vaccine, you can also choose which arm you get the COVID-19 vaccine in.
5561	111440	Not what you originally told us, Matt. Nothing like it whatsever. And we may never get a viable vaccine, so will you hold us back forever? Who gave you that right? Absolutely no one. I see there is a clear reason why you eschew parliamentary scrutiny, so desperately needed now.
5562	110075	Great to see @KizzyPhD  and @BarneyGrahamMD continued to recognized for their work on coronavirus vaccine.Well deserved.
5563	111461	@AstorAaron Agree with David, disagree with Aaron. Vaccine mandates are vital. Masking is important until enough of the population is vaccinated. We're not there yet. Covid-19 is a bad actor. It can enter the brain/other organs and cause long term problems--problems that will tax our system.
5564	111571	@RpublicRestored Bill Gates wants something in the COVID-19 vaccine that will tell if we‚Äôve gotten the vaccine. I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt trust that and I‚Äôd bet it will track us as well.
5565	107743	It will be free because the population will be the test subjects to observe the long term effects the vaccine has, unless they've been testing this since 2015 there is not a chance I'd be getting this vaccine basically a guinea pig for some multi billion dollar corporation.
5566	110334	Genuinely can't wrap my mind around how bafflingly, absurdly, unquestionably stupid you have to be after the last year to not get the vaccine.
5567	107926	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19 and the May 4 pledging conference must be a success. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
5568	111284	"India's stand is right.This ""vaccine passport"" cannot be internationally imposed by Northern countries until everyone in the world is vaccinated.""No one is safe until everyone is safe."" Since this is agreed upon as a moral stand, let all governments follow it.@WHO @drharshvardhan"
5569	108951	@InterBang @PeterHotez @maggiemfox @CNN Is not my intention to spoil something. I want to know what are we talking about. So we count to the huge number of Covid19 in USA also the asymptomatic, but say vaccine is effective in 90%, when this number is valid only for symptomatic and this with specific criteria?
5570	108324	I did read that the mu variant may not be as infectious as the Alpha or Delta variant, but it is concerning if the mu variant is resistant to vaccines since it could thwart the progress made there.
5571	110444	I'm getting my first dose of covid19 vaccine , girl I am so contre coueur but I am doing it for a reason..a goal..
5572	109487	the only cure for coronavirus is bed rest. just like any other VIRUS it is not bacterial aka no antibiotics and any vaccine will be like a flu shot but it is still a VIRUS.

5580	112258	If you‚Äôre not a conspiracy theorist i feel sorry for you ngl, i don‚Äôt have all the facts on why you shouldn‚Äôt trust this vaccine, in fact i don‚Äôt have any, but you know what....MI NAH TEK IT
5581	112779	FYI - though I think y'all are smart enough to know this. The coronavirus vaccine for animals does NOT protect against covid.  Do NOT tell people to go their their pet vaccinated against covid via the coronavirus vaccine.  I'll [redacted] you.
5582	110884	@Cernovich So what are y‚Äôall going to do if there‚Äôs a vaccine for #coronavirus ? Serious question. Will you take it? Will you tell your elderly relatives to take it? Or not?
5583	109731	@OfSifter @JohnColton70 Except there‚Äôs a vaccine for the flu. So how are we supposed to treat it like the flu? Can‚Äôt get a shot for Covid19.
5584	112820	@jmtiger9899 I took my son to the doctor a few weeks back for a checkup. The doctor told me that Coronavirus has been around for years and there has never been a vaccine. He said people would be crazy to think this one will suddenly have one and it work. Pretty scary
5585	110832	1/4: @nycgov is in effect mandating the vaccine. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get the vaccine, you can‚Äôt enjoy simple everyday activities.‚Äù
5586	111606	A bit concerning but I guess he has done enough to be trusted. I don't ever see there being a vaccine and Trump knows it!
5587	112788	People assume or take it for granted that a #covid19 #coronavirus #vaccine will be found. What if a vaccine is never found? We don‚Äôt have a vaccine for the common cold or for HIV nor an effective flu vaccine. @newscomauHQ @WHO #wuflu
5588	108661	@marketman52 They say the anti-body may last less than 3 months if you‚Äôve had Coronavirus, so how can they ensure a vaccine will any longer than that?
5589	112693	We want to hear from people who are still deciding whether to get a vaccine, and give them the opportunity to talk with an expert about it. If that's you, or someone you know, please reach out! @kschorsch @beckyvevea @IMPACT4HC
5590	202103	Didn‚Äôt i know the reaction pain after the vaccine, similar to Covid-19 vaccine. Hand so sore and damn heavy üò≠
5591	112575	American citizen tries to fly to hawaii with fake vaccine card and got arrested. A citizen of south America breaks the law illegally crossing the U.S.  border and they get a free flight to another location in the U.S. without any vaccine requirement. hmmm
5592	111512	@ronnytodgers @andrew_croxford Yes, and that may be the problem. When they tested previous coronavirus vaccines on ferrets - which had excellent antibody response from the vaccine - they died when exposed to the wild virus. That is why there has been no successful coronavirus vaccine to date.
5593	202362	I just got my first #CovidVaccine today. One step closer to things being back to normal and sending #COVID19 straight to hell https://t.co/la94khIWGk

5596	112873	@bigron2000 If I do get Covid-19 I will get better the natural way without going out to get a vaccine that doesn‚Äôt work and has fatal side effects. I‚Äôd actually rather die from Bill Gates and Fauci‚Äôs superbug than get vaccinated with god knows what.
5597	109215	@basboon007 @thehill You understand that MRNA has been around for a while, just hadn‚Äôt been used as a coronavirus vaccine since before this pandemic there was never a coronavirus vaccine. Any vaccine regardless of the platform would by definition be experimental? Do you just ignore all data?
5598	111501	You mean like #vaccines and how #Americans are so spoiled that they‚Äôre literally turning away not one but 3 FREE medical tool options that will save millions on this planet? When there are countries that would just be grateful for ONE? #PerspectivesAreKey
5599	111835	@ForAllTheMarble @LegalizeitLala Pork is a harborer of many virus'. It is a dirty meat and different coronavirus' are often present. It's so toxic it is illegal to transport pig manure across State lines. Flu vaccine is another big link. Gelatin in any vax is from pork too. Plus the mass pig killings in China
5600	112803	Even Regular flu vaccines don‚Äôt protect against all strains and variations of flu circulating each year. They try to target the most like one to spread widely or do the most damage. Close is not enough in viruses.

5606	111326	@NicolaSturgeon @jasonleitch @JeaneF1MSP @FionaCMcQueen With student nurses still being put on the frontline when will we become a priority for #Coronavirus #vaccine? Universities say we are not priority for facefitting nor vaccine but we are still to be accomodated.
5607	110051	Adam got his first round of the Coronavirus vaccine. He goes back in April for the other shot. This means there's a 90% chance the kids will be going back to school this coming school year. It's going to be so weird! (And I'll miss not being sick from the stuff they bring home!)
5608	111734	So they believe in the science of an antibody test but they don't believe in the science of a vaccine? Seems stupid enough.
5609	111827	@EricROlson @sciencentric How long would a vaccine be effective? Since we have seen how wildly differently the COVID-19 virus has impacted people around the world, is there a one vaccine fits all remedy?
5610	110259	What is this bullshit?  They don't know how long you are protected from the vaccine either.  The key would be how long it takes the virus to mutate, and when it does if it is even still contagious to humans.  We don't know that yet.

5620	112444	After further research and analysis, I have determined that CSL most likely added a component from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because they were attempting to develop a coronavirus vaccine would be a safe and effective for treating patients with an immunodeficiency.
5621	112457	@realDonaldTrump Ready to be honest about this?  The task force has falsely led people to believe a vaccine makes it all magically better.  If they knew distancing and masks would still be in play would they still be advocating lockdowns and now school?

5651	109306	@PhilipRucker Trump doesn't get all this credit.  Coronaviruses have been around and Covid-19 is a variation. 17 yrs ago, they started working on a vaccine for SARS which is a coronavirus.  That's why it was done so quickly...it was halfway there when scientists tweaked for C-19.

5653	108305	Excellent news , 10 days it starts.?  and if the Tory and SNP governments get there act together everyone could should have the vaccine within 4 weeks and back to normal, now that would be a happy New year , we have 3 vaccines JUST GIVE THE PEOPLE THE VACCINE .....!
5654	107894	@zerohedge Not surprising. There will be endless shots ahead. Covid-19 virus and vaccine turns on to be an effective way to significantly reduce world population. Enjoy
5655	107777	Am I missing something with this Pfizer SARS-2 coronavirus vaccine announcement, because I've yet to hear anyone say how long it's effective. 3 months? 6 months? A year? For life? Anyone? Seems like this is a critical detail.
5656	112648	@bruceymonkey @kimbikeskc @vicc_nicolee @warofthesuburbs We've never been able to develop a single anti-viral or vaccine for any coronavirus. Even after worldwide infections of SARS, MERS and 15% of the common cold every year.Yet we can make one for a novel coronavirus within months? Draw your own conclusions.
5657	108074	Accept this fact that historically it took avenge 11 years 2develop a vaccine. Secondly gene based technology is new with no proven history so it should take more time then normal technology. Otherwise vaccines will take more life‚Äôs then #coronavirus @Iamsamirarora @ETNOWlive
5658	201987	Evelyn does not visit me in Welland due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.  All my vaccine shots were given.  I also got my seasonal Flu shot.  I did get my booster shot.  I have selected to stay away from any bar.  sometimes I go to restaurants.  MacDonalds is a very short walk away.
5659	112407	@JenJoeGibson @Joannew68022274 @spunawebxx Covid has never been isolated.The virus is a normal coronavirus no more dangerous than the flu.Will you be queuing to get your kids jabbed with an unlicenced, untested and unneeded vaccine?
5660	109422	I just spoke to a close friend in the medical field who said there may be an issue with the Covid19 vaccine.  Denmark is rumored to have an issue with covid-19 mutating from Animal exposure and is making the vaccine ineffective.  This news has me anxiety ridden.
5661	107694	@PhilipWatson_ This is what we do about anti-vaxxers: No job. No entry. No NHS accessBeing coughed on by someone with coronavirus is not my idea of freedom. Those refusing a vaccine must face the consequences. The rest of us have rights too, including the right to life
5662	110000	Going to get my COVID-19 vaccine booster a little later today. Excited to try my best to keep myself and those around me healthy. Will share updates on its effects on me to show folks as to what its like. My 2nd shot wore me out for 24 hours, but was otherwise fine for reference.
5663	109801	My guess is you better have a damn good answer to question No. 5:‚ÄúIf you have ever received a FDA  approved vaccine ... please explain how your sincerely held religious belief ... causes you to object to the COVID-19 vaccine compared to other vaccines you received.‚Äù
5664	108364	@bernhardsulzer @CalebJHull Riddle me this? Why is it that VAERS is actually saying that the vaccine for Covid19, or The Coof, The China Virus, The Pandemic, etc whatever you call it. The Gov Funded VAERS is saying the Vaccine is actually killing more people than any other Vaccine made in the past 15 years.
5665	110823	Will you get the covid-19 vaccine once its available for you to get? #CovidVaccine #COVID19 #vaccine Please retweet!!
5666	110197	Really disturbing numbers from recent @CCDHate survey: 16% of Britons say they would refuse a #coronavirus vaccine, and another 15% unsure if they would take it. Anti-vaxx propapanga has apparently entered deeply into British culture, leveraging the long reach of social media.

5674	110323	@ReddCoach @itschappy @btbarnes11 The vaccine is a treatment. Just like the flu vaccine.There is no immunity, natural or otherwise to a coronavirus.
5675	112145	Someone should explain to @chrisreykdal how vaccines work.You see, w/the EUA COVID-19 Vaccines, they just tell your body to spike protein antibodies.This is like throwing caps in those ring toss games.  Sometimes one will make it on the bottle.But, you still get sick
5676	201940	Hey #Detroit! If you‚Äôre 16+, you can get the vaccine (I get my second shot tomorrow).  Let‚Äôs all roll out sleeves up and knock #COVID19 out!
5677	108265	"Why is it these folks never come to the conclusion that ""God"" has their backs by giving humans the knowledge to devise a vaccine to keep them safe?Because they then wouldn't have an excuse to claim ""persecution,"" which is the far-right's political bread &amp; butter. Buncha whiners"
5678	108705	@RepAdamSchiff What world do you live in Trump keeps pushing that we need to get a vaccine witch is science. But it is funny that a party that always is saying we need to believe the science, thinks there is more than 2 genders. (Male and Female) plus I think this whole covid19 is a hoxes
5679	111052	@Jay_Beezy27 @fife_rodney @FOX5Vegas @GovSisolak Still this is not ‚Äújust a cold‚Äù, it‚Äôs the coronavirus, a new strain of it, that has no vaccine. People are being bed ridden for weeks to months. Over 100,000 dead just in the United States. That‚Äôs not something you can argue is false, if you do well you‚Äôre living a fantasy.

5682	111344	Guys. This isn‚Äôt interesting or smart or good. It‚Äôs shitty. They could require the vaccine for employees. Instead they‚Äôre trying to save money on paid leave.
5683	108694	Well we are not yet fully using China made vaccine. We must be worried if we are exclusively using China-made vaccine. The bigger problem is how to make the vaccination faster and efficiently. We are still on the low rate.

5700	108639	With regards to this whole vaccine row, aren‚Äôt we supposed to be battling the coronavirus not each other?No wonder the human race is fucked.
5701	108619	Except here's the thing. This is a man made virus.  And not only were they funded to CREATE this virus, they also were funded to come up with a vaccine. And when the world is sick enough, this one company will ALSO GET FUNDED TO PROVIDE THE WORLD WITH THE VACCINE
5702	107773	@dan_pettit23 @yelobeli @Vinylmusiclives @GMB @lisanandy There‚Äôs this little thing called coronavirus and the millions of vaccines for it being rolled out right now.

But my 12 yo son will not be getting it until there is more safety data surrounding the myocarditis issue.  I‚Äôm not ignorant.
5711	112629	Yeah, it's official.I think any person who can get the vaccine and refuses to do so, then subsequently gets #COVID19, should be refused medical care if treating them will take space from a vaccinated person.
5712	111286	@swansoupy @MetabolicallyF @walkher2thegate @CiaShade @Theejoshhalll @_geela_ Right?

5713	112701	@ghuff No, I honestly don‚Äôt considering it hadn‚Äôt been mentioned/referenced for many prior tweets. You‚Äôre just bringing it back up to try and taint my argument. Yes, I do. The spike protein located on COVID-19 and in the vaccines is damaging to our cardio-vascular system.
5714	112264	@RonaldNHughes In order to avoid being infected by the COVID-19 virus again, then spread the virus to others, the day before yesterday, I mustered up the courage to get my first COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Pfizer. I need to take my second COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Pfizer after 21 days.

5716	112392	@Charvettebey Coronavirus has been around since ppl began getting colds....which, who knows how long that‚Äôs been. There have been other forms, like SARS or MERS. Seems like they def had some data to go by. Covid, though, this one spreads so fast and furious. Really hope the vaccine helps.
5717	112687	The govm't doesn't care about person's rights and immunity.Their agenda is get the jab or get out.  #communist
5718	109356	@larrysivaans I guess all coronavirus can spread through air if we catch droplets (even the tiny ones) from patients' cough or sneeze and this virus is kind of new also there's no vaccines yet so this virus spread rapidly than the other coronavirus
5719	111128	How do people take the COVID-19 vaccine if it isn't available in Civil Hospitals and PHCs? ü§îHealth Minister @drharshvardhan will keep denying that there is vaccine shortage, but the reality is way different than what he claims! Here the Civil Hospital has run out of vaccine üò°
5720	108308	I get being apprehensive over getting the COVID vaccine. But to say it took less than a year to develop is misleading. Yes it did take less than a year, but why? It‚Äôs because they were not starting from ground zero. SARS and MERS are also a type of coronavirus
5721	202370	"11/ How I feel after shot #1 of the #COVID19Vaccine is how my parents and parents-in-law felt after #2.My experience is admittedly ""anecdata,"" but maybe it's true that folks who already had #COVID19 respond to shot #1 like everyone else responds to shot #2."

5755	107715	Then why did all of you say you would never take a vaccine developed under Trump? You said it would kill people.
5756	110620	It‚Äôs just going to be really hard - if not impossible - to gather in public or in private - and not pass this stuff all over the place.  This spread is a new ballgame.  I hope it‚Äôs a less dangerous variant and it might be just that but I wouldn‚Äôt roll the dice.  I‚Äôd get the jab.
5757	110640	@udaysubbarayan I think Covid can be controlled to allow in-person work if there is regular boosting (until a sterilizing vaccine is developed) and masking if community spread is high. Best case scenario is Covid burns itself out to be a benign circulating coronavirus, but probably not likely.
5758	111929	I took the COVID-19 vaccines, but later found out they can weaken the immune system. I'm not taking anymore vaccines for Covid 19. They'll keep coming up with vaccine after vaccine. Don't trust Fauci, and the CDC

5766	112694	Keep an eye out for the recorded session - you do not want to miss this as it has great information regarding staying safe and connected during the holidays as well as general information about exposure, isolation, testing, and the COVID vaccine.
5767	111282	My aunt in Seattle with Ovarian cancer has received the vaccine (both shots). She‚Äôs doing good. She went skiing last week in Colorado.

5771	109428	@jackieohughes @LynneMWhite1 @christopherhope @YouGov Again, conjecture. Currently there is no consensus that ANYONE had any immunity to THIS coronavirus. This is why people who have the flu jab can still get other coronaviruses etc.

5776	109662	Just had a great chat with @natashaCJAD on @CJAD800 about the #COVID19 #vaccine and what it means for us in Canada. In summary: I'm overjoyed. None of this was inevitable. We've never had a coronavirus vaccine before; now it looks like we will have several.
5777	108796	Why the hell are police officers  not getting covid19 vaccine before teachers BTW no offence to teachers but imo police should be getting it in same way or after NHS staff

5780	112733	the average american will be waiting another year to get the vaccine. wealthy connected people will take precedence over us.
5781	111577	@ellymelly is bang on. Even with tough restrictions, this virus - for which there is no vaccine - will still infect people because there‚Äôs always idiots who don‚Äôt follow the rules. Just scrap the rules and get on with it. We‚Äôll all die one day anyway. #COVID19nz #Covid_19
5782	201942	First COVID-19 vaccine booked. They are hard to come by in Canada so I am very grateful üôè One step towards going back to a normal life again.
5783	112559	@rupasubramanya @EricTopol @UKHSA We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.

5799	109771	Such completely irresponsible journalism and social media from this Sinclair owned station. It presents two random folks saying they won‚Äôt take the vaccine because ‚Äúsomeone had bad side effects‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get the flu shot,‚Äù but then offers nothing to address their fears

5810	112906	@jamiedupree I am guessing that the GOP faithful will use this to say the vaccines don‚Äôt work so no use getting it. Also that the CDC said the vaccine would stop COVID-19 but it didn‚Äôt, so they lie and we should not listen to them on masks either.
5811	110460	Can someone explain to me why, if you‚Äôre vaccinated, are you all standing in long lines to get tested?  Seems like if you‚Äôre sick that you‚Äôve just spreading Covid around.  #CovidVaccine #COVID19

5815	110922	@8NEWS @GovernorVA @VDHgov Why do I need to get vaccinated if I've already had it? Don't tell me because we don't know how long it lasts, because we don't know how long the vaccine last! Or the side effects of either #COVID19 #vaccine
5816	111047	The coronavirus vaccines have only been developed for a year. No one knows if it will be safe for the next 10 or 20 years. It's a hoax that they are safe.
5817	112682	Black and brown residents in Prince George‚Äôs County account for the highest rates of COVID-19 in the state! Why is it this hard for my 70 year old Aunt to get a vaccine?
5818	111552	@JenTromans @o_rips Actually he is claiming that the new Covid-19 vaccine will cause GB. Believe it or not, that just isn't true. Covid-19 infections can cause a resurgence in people who have had it or currently do, but not the vaccine. Honestly anti-vaxxers blow my mind.
5819	112045	@EddieRNashton Where‚Äôs your evidence you can be reinfected? Getting infected by delta and then Omicron is two different viruses so not ‚Äúreinfected‚Äù. The common cold is a coronavirus. Why would a virus with 50 mutations be considered the same virus? If you‚Äôre not immune, vaccines won‚Äôt work.

5822	112463	When the time comes I will not take the covid-19 vaccine because biologically it has the ability to alter one's genetic make-up. My body by default has the ability to replenish any wornout tissue.

5825	110409	@RubinReport Which is EXACTLY why coronavirus vaccines NEVER made it past the animal studies previously; enhancement caused them to get gravelly ill or die when exposed again (cytokine storm!) They are making it sound ‚Äònormal‚Äô so we don‚Äôt trust our gut instinct.
5826	201915	#OnTheNews: Talking about employers mandating employees to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Don‚Äôt know about you, but I really do not like mandates.

5827	108738	@my_own_RESEARCH @MockDelbourne @SmallRedOne That‚Äôs not what she is saying - once the world has been exposed to the virus (via vaccine or infection), the IFR will most likely trend similar to influenza, if not less.  Yes, this is horrible and a terrible experience for all of us, but structurally, this is a coronavirus.
5828	111369	You are NOT safe from COVID-19 after you've had it -- just like you aren't safe from the flu after you've had it. The flu changes so you can catch it again. COVID changed and will again. That's why vaccines exist; because our bodies can't achieve immunity alone.Get vaccinated.
5829	109834	I'm not rooting against the COVID Vaccine, because I do think they have a purpose for those that are vulnerable....but this is not good.
5830	112180	I hope with this money the government WILL make testing and vaccines FREE and AVAILABLE to every Ugandan. They owe us this. It‚Äôs the least they can do!!
5831	110399	@plyons45 Paul, my cousin's son is a consultant in respiratory diseases and when I spoke to him about feeling unwell after my covid19 jab. He said it was a sign that my immune was working well and to take paracetamol. My feeling unwell passed after 48 hours.

5851	108390	Let's also pay attention to the timeline for #access going from the first HIC deploying the vaccine until the poorest country receiving the doses. And from the very first person with access until the last person getting it's shot. No one is safe until everyone is safe!
5852	202207	Second #COVID19 vaccine done ‚úÖ as always @NHSuk service is slick and friendly. Even had the same lady as last time who was brilliant with the needle. #COVID19Vaccination
5853	111003	@bellamadison22 @JamesR2544 @thehill No, but it came out very quickly when it was being developed. This vaccine for Covid-19 also isn't new, we've used this same exact technology for multiple decades, we've just decided it's bad now for some reason despite it not being bad for the MMR vaccine in 2000s'
5854	201952	@Marumo_Mokgaga @HealthZA But procedure and training we got more especially for this covid19 vaccine. The whole thing is just so wrong.
5855	109246	Oh wait I think I know, it's because when you get the real coronavirus then you usually don't feel any symptoms within the first 2 weeks of infection. So that means the vaccine is working the way it should.
5856	110302	@SilVeRWiNg947 @GatekeeperLabs @NatGeo Coronavirus vaccine is an 'RNA' vaccine, the first of it's type. You can't post videos of 'DNA' vaccines. It's not relevant to this story as it's a different technology.Please, do some research...

5858	108238	Isn‚Äôt this going against all of their established safety protocols? How did 18 months go to 12? They don‚Äôt even have a viable vaccine yet. WTF? I think I‚Äôd hold off.
5859	108383	No way the coronavirus industry ever wants this pandemic to end...it is a near quandary for all of us, save for the vaccines
5860	110749	@sr_patrick Actually I have some information on that subject. I thought originally that covid and the flu are just separate coronaviruses has but apparently the flu is NOT a coronavirus so it's a totally separate vaccine according to a pharmacist I talked to you last week.

5866	111868	We are getting started on the vaccine deployment that we promised.  It will take time.  But we are getting started.
5867	110325	@helpmebcatholic @cmsorrps4610 @FrMatthewLC 1\ A mutated version of COVID19 will not make the necessity of vaccination moot. It might make the vaccine slightly less effective is all.Yes, COVID19 has already mutated slightly this year but I've seen no evidence that it will seasonally mutate like the flu.
5868	112055	So, if a non-US country develops a vaccine first, then the US will just have to cross its fingers and hope for the benevolence of countries and organizations that our government has spent the last 7 months antagonizing...

5872	202215	So . . . my crystal ball was correct for the very first time during the entire pandemic.  Today, #SCOTUS sunk the #OSHAETS mandate, but threw a lifeline to the #CMS vaccine mandate so it could be enforced.  I just wish #covid19 knew the difference! https://t.co/Y4850uFLnZ
5873	107793	@CNN No one can legally force another to take vaccine in US but its their own lives and no one can assured that vaccine is 100% safe without side effect in years to come but if they aren't careful with SOP and catch covid-19 and then die, it's their own funeral anyway.

5883	201883	Biked (with son, who got his second COVID-19 shot yesterday) to Walgreens at Woodfords and got booster. You should get booster, too.
5884	112110	Ohhh... I really want to see a vaccine but I don't know if I want to be a guinea pig (read: am brave enough).
5885	112594	@PorcupinePink @julesspaceman @afowler06 Coronavirus vaccine has been around almost 2 decades and studied for far longer. SARS and then MERS both coronavirus have vaccines. Covid or SARS-Cov-2 is a just a new strain of corona virus which is why the turn around for a vaccine was so quick.
5886	109376	If the coronavirus vaccine works I wonder if it would work on the haunta virus? I think that's how you spell it
5887	108052	It's like David Icke was sayingThey can make up any symptoms for this virus to enforce a new ruleThen they will do the same for vaccine deaths
5888	202133	I just took my 87 year old mother, for her COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, at the federal location on Waters in Tampa, she was asked to present her ID during EVERY step of the vaccine process, I feel I should be upset, because, asking for an ID is so racistüò¨
5889	111477	@PeterHotez Personally, I like my vaccine aged in oak barrels to really bring out the flavor of coronavirus
5890	202073	So sad another one of the #AntiVaxxers died of #COVID19.I loved #Meatloaf music, but this was just a moronic waste.Get the #vaccine people!#VaccinesWork #VaccineDeaths
5891	110681	"** PUBIC ANNOUNCEMENT **Just yesterday the hospital where I work in Germany passed a circular that said ""All unvaccinated workers must either now take the Vaccine OR get tested for COVID-19 on a daily basis OR stay home and not get paid..."
5892	112099	"My prediction for a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. is that half of the country will be main lining it while screaming, ""I don't care what it does, I'm ready to challenge God!"" while the other half will be hiding out in the Utah desert ranting about how 5G is in it or something."
5893	107767	COVID-19 may not completely go away even with a vaccine, but hopefully it‚Äôs not concerned a pandemic soon. üôèüèª I‚Äôd like life to get back to normal üòä
5894	201893	@SteveSchmidtSES Steve Schmidt you are consistently my coronavirus vaccine for my mind against all the crazy in this Administration
5895	202300	Many elderly folk have spent months missing family. Today, my Ma was visited by her GP for the 2nd time &amp; given her 2nd vaccine. #COVID19 She was delighted. Bravo, bravo Health Boards clever enough to think this one through. It was worth any #gpvaccinepayment Thank you #NHS
5896	109618	One of my concerns about the coronavirus strand in UK is how it will impact the roll out of  the vaccine.
5897	202390	Outstanding work led my @meganbcole @BUSPH. Thank you for invitation to participate. FQHCs are helping the country reach sought after #CovidVaccine equity goals. Cc: @The_BMC @MA_CEAL
5898	109102	@TammiFire31 @my2greatgirls @DevinNunes I don't watch MSM either.  I follow epidemiologist on here and read from different sources.  The coronavirus is NOT the flu, which has a vaccine and antiviral meds. The swine flu caused an elementary school to close 3 weeks in Houston.
5899	201935	I am ready to call for vaccination centre for my first COVID-19 jab!! 8am it opens. Let‚Äôs hope I can get through today
5900	111070	@ABC  Keep the Virus thing going just when all those that took the Vaccine, both doses, are in the Hospitals with the Virus.  So now we are going to push this one Huh.  Can't go without a Virus a Month Plan...
5901	110046	I hope parents are watching carefully‚Ä¶ why are they trying to do this ‚Äúquickly ‚Äú? Why do they want this in your kids‚Ä¶ you can not undo this vaccine!
5902	107824	If #Trump and his #magasheep don't believe in the #coronavirus,  why such a rush to get a vaccine? Who are the guinea pigs? #TrumpVirus #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #GOPGestapo
5903	112146	Despite your personal beliefs and political standpoints, I think we can all agree that if a safe and effective vaccine is actually distributed starting in October, that would be great. I mean the least we can do is hope.. right? #cppCOM1101
5904	111900	When does it END? THEY HAVE NO PLANS ON AN ENDING. It is about the money! If after 3 jabs + future ones AND pills. It DOES NOT AND WILL NOT WORK!
5905	112187	Why don‚Äôt you trust doctors and nurses? This is why. You have no business being in the medical industry having anti-vax beliefs. Plus, I‚Äôm happy watching nurses in the US get fired or quit their jobs over this vaccine. We don‚Äôt want you treating us.
5906	109835	Except it‚Äôs nothing like the measles vaccine, is it?I had all the aforementioned vaccines too. As far as I‚Äôm aware, they were actually safe and effective with years of clinical data to back that up.
5907	202320	What a Friday! Did a two-hour interview on medical history and living through a pandemic this morning, and this afternoon I'm off to get my covid19 vaccine!
5908	108333	"People are getting mad at this for no reason. If someone mocks vaccines then it's okay to mock their death. Just seems like generic twitter contrarianism to go ""no actually, we need to mourn this guy who was putting everyone in danger by not getting vaccinated"". Fuck off"
5909	112717	@paulofthewoods0 You‚Äôd be correct if by ‚Äúvaccines work‚Äù you mean they are 100% effective. Unfortunately coronavirus vaccines (like the flu) are not. That does not mean they are useless either. That‚Äôs why the more people take it the more effective it is overall.
5910	110281	Vaccine or No Vaccine?Not being close to the top of the list will make that decision for the majority of us so don't trip.If there's any issues with the vaccine, they'll be known before it's our turn to get the shot(s).#COVID19 #CovidVaccine
5911	109329	@WendyLo86145831 I agree... people should say if they want to be vaccinated or not... some countries - like Germany - using vaccines from different countries... hope all vaccines are good and helpful, and the coronavirus can be controlled the way its possible.
5912	111668	You advertise for vaccines. Lol I doubt the average person is going to believe a word you say. Conflicted.
5913	111368	If COVID-19 was as apparent in humans, there would be zero vaccine hesitancy. Still, COVID-19 is probably more devastating on the human population than the worm is on the snail population.
5914	111756	@DrRPNishank Please sir postpone neet itna I am covid19 positive my parents will meet me to make me approach center and they have some health issues if you postpone neet the vaccine will be available in one or two months and please postpone neet I have lost interest in my life I am beggingsir
5915	111313	How convenient China creates the virus, covers it up, and now China may be the first to have a vaccine#ChinaMustPay #COVID19 #WuhanVirus #Trump2020
5916	112193	@LeeSovaClaypool I don't think we should widely distribute any COVID-19 vaccines that are developed...it wouldn't be fair to the people who've already died from the pandemic. üôÑ
5917	110109	Why does J&amp;J need to repeat every day how vaccines are going to save humanity? If they were so good you wouldn't need to spend millions every day to advertise it.
5918	112348	If anyone has any doubt about how effective the Covid-19 vaccines COULD be if everyone got them, in the state of Indiana...
5919	109363	Good explanation of why this is NOT a conspiracy re the AZ vaccine. (And loved the yogurt analogy - vindicated !!)
5920	201848	Yesterday, I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The fine folks working at the Circuit of the Americas site did a great job of making the process seamless and easy. I'm extremely grateful for all that went into this and feel hope for the first time in a while.
5921	109268	"So the Science Minister doesn't know if CSL actually has the ability to actually manufacture a Covid-19 vaccine if one is found? She's been ""advised it could be possible""... Jesus. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è#insiders"
