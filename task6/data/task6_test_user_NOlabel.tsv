111083	@tamifairchild1 @KingMoyer @TheRightMelissa @RealCandaceO Indeed certain vaccines can in a small number of cause such responses. However, in those cases so would the virus being immaculated against. Actually, that is the problem with the more severe presentation of coronavirus (and I am concerned that a vaccine may be bad for some)
110702	@deep_biden the govt system has created corona.they want a depopulation. they only care about wealth, not humanity.Thats why we see idiotic restrictions, toxic vaccines and a couple variants of corona now,..What would be necessary is to get rid of the coronavirus wit chemikalsthesolution
110204	The Canadian HC @mckinnondavid blocked me for pointing this out, but Canada is screwing countries like ours with vaccine nationalism. Sri Lankans need to stop serving him breakfast
109871	I‚Äôm a consultant in ICU and we have lots of #COVID19 patients. We have great PPE and my risk is low. But it‚Äôs not zero. And I might catch it in the community anyway. The vaccine protects me. But it also protects my family. And that protects other families.
108890	Comparing the covid-19 vaccine with the smallpox vaccine if like comparing apples to fish.  You get away with this because people have no clue scientifically how they are made tested and then administered. Other then they are paying people and begging you to get the covid-19 jab.
201923	I (finally) have my appointment for the booster shot. I work from home and always wear a mask so I've been putting it off.Everyone should get their 3rd dose of the vaccine. The shots you got a few months ago are not good enough anymore. #Omicron #Covid19
111885	The first phase 1 trial for a Coronavirus vaccine occured today.  It only took 65 days from obtaining sequence to the first trial injection.  Fastest in U.S. history. Hopefully the trials will prove vaccine effective.
109003	Omicron came out like a week ago, they say they have a vaccine for it already, and then wonder why people are skeptical
110186	@Goalkickingguru They've been working on mRNA vaccines to tackle coronaviruses since the 2002 outbreak of SARs. Believe it or not, the first coronavirus was detected in animals in the 1920s.It's cute you think it was all new last year. Bless.
110122	No surprise there.Next will be Rump's snake oil vaccine to stop Covid infections @MaddowBlog  Beware!
110535	Reading comments on Facebook and getting excited that the plot twist in the COVID-19 drama is that once a vaccine is created it's useless because half the population refuse to take it
109635	@LolaNJ20 @davidmweissman @marcorubio These people get the vaccine first like they got the best medical treatment, no average American can afford, when they got infected just to tell everyone that Covid19 is just a mild flu.üôÑ
108476	@hellyboo778 Hi there, COVID-19 vaccinations are not currently mandatory in the UK, but are a legal requirement to work in some social care settings. It is the colleague‚Äôs decision whether they receive the vaccine or not. [1/2]
201919	As of Wednesday, 611,429 individuals had received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 166,131 have been fully vaccinated.
112294	I didn't hear discussion in the Senate COVID-19 hearing today that indicated that our scientists are interacting w/scientists around the world on vaccine development. Why not? Shouldn't it be an international effort to deliver the best vaccine to everyone?(Sen Burr mentioned it.)
109103	It has to be here everyone is flying all over the world bring it here or brining it there. But the good news is the vaccine might still work? I say might. No science at this point. All they have to do is reformulate 7.4 billion doses or is it 14.8 doses? I am moving to a desert.
109066	@DavidChalmers1 @CareyGercarey @LBC @NickFerrariLBC Interesting conundrum. How will you feel if he is offered it and takes your advice and refuses it. He then contracts COVID-19 and dies before Oxford vaccine is available. The Pfisor vaccine works for others but you advised against it. Not sure I could live with that. ü§î
110709	Extending is not the same as using it. It is there in case it is needed which is right in my view when we have no real date when all adults will be vaccinated in this country, (that is first and second jab) and too little knowledge yet regarding new variants. We are nearly there.
201929	I just got my Covid-19 vaccine, I‚Äôm so happy I could cry happy tears . #vaccinated Thank you to all the doctors, scientists and CDC for making this happen
110194	"Sources tell me Bill Gates just made an airborne coronavirus ""vaccine"" and the only way to stop it from getting in you is if you wear a mask. üò∑"
108710	@Linda36758099 I think they've been working on much better flu treatments, stuff that will boost your immune system in general to help you fight off whatever causes flu. I think that's what the non deepfrozen ones are, like AZ/Oxford one There ain't no covid19 so there can't be a vaccine1
110208	Why does an asshole like @marcorubio get to skip the line? Why waste it on someone who knowingly spreads the virus? The vaccine should go to hospital workers first.
108300	I‚Äôm not sure what to believe here. Surely he wouldn‚Äôt sacrifice his own child for political gain, but it‚Äôs Putin, so maybe he would? If there is a vaccine. Which there is probably not.  Sigh.
112588	If your employer requires a #Covid19 vaccine and you refuse to take it, you're getting fired for not supporting the values of the organization you work forNo one should support any product or company if they can't support their values
107733	@PutinsLapDog @RepThomasMassie So what happened when a fully  vaxxed person get the coronavirus again? The non-vaxxed get a refund?
108120	@JoeBiden If the vaccines work so great, why are vaccinated so afraid of getting Covid-19, you have to keep wearing masks? Plus being so scared of the unvaccinated, you fired them from their jobs. Forcing kids to get vaccinated when the risk is higher for them then Covid-19 is plain evil.
110920	.@JohnCornyn lies again.@JoeBiden called for every state, territory, tribe to open up vaccinations for all by May 1; not every person be vaccinated by May 1.Even if vaccines are open to all by May 1st, it'll still be a heavy lift.It takes 2 wks after each shot for immunity.
107703	From what I've seen around the world, the only assumption anyone can make (and I've had this assumption a long while) is that the #COVID19 virus is in the #vaccine.#Covid19UK #WearAMask ?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
110631	The #BoosterShot kicked my butt. Down with Fever. Aches. Arm hurts. But I am grateful to have the shot. I don‚Äôt want #COVID19 anymore. I‚Äôve had it 2x. And amazingly I am still walking the earth. The #VaccineSideEffects are worth the blessing of life! Get #vaccinated
111098	Poor lady. I hope she doesn't have any side effects. The way everyone is pushing this vaccine is unreal.
112113	Do you plan on getting on an airplane BEFORE there is a #COVID19 vaccine?#coronavirus #FundraisingTwitter
108444	@rebekahiknight @trekker34 @realDonaldTrump I don't understand... are there more or less deaths because of Covid19? If it's a hoax... why Trump worked so hard to provide us a vaccine?.Why the GOP are getting it? please don't follow their example and wait, essential workers deserve to get the vaccine first.
110353	This is what's going to HAPPEN if these STUPID people out there take this UN-NECESSARY VACCINE for a non-existent VIRUS that is nothing more then the COMMON COLD as Covid-19 nothing more then the flu and Pneumonia  masquerading as Covid-19 @JustinTrudeau
201905	I felt like I was holding my breath waiting for my grandmother to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Te amo much√≠simo grandmaüíõ @UnivHealthSA https://t.co/oV54KXBm1o
111814	My grandparents have yet to find the vaccine. The war crime hearings can wait, they deserve to rot in their cell anyway. Why is it so hard for our government to take care of the American people? They literally work for us.
109324	I‚Äôve always been pro-vaccines.  But after having a bad reaction to a pneumonia vaccine that took me to the ER this past May... I‚Äôm not going volunteer to be 1st in line for the COVID-19 vaccine. But I‚Äôll get it eventually. Probably.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
110861	@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump President Obama got the H1N1 therapeutics out in less than 2 months &amp; the vaccine out in 6 months. It is now past 10 months for the Covid-19 vaccine. So how is this a great achievement?? How has Trump done anything????
108320	Oh... oh no. It's going to be one thing to get everyone to even take the vaccine, but asking them to keep wearing masks?This pandemic is never going to end.
108630	@Europe_Awake_ @SethMacFarlane So this says they contracted delta variant from abroad‚Ä¶which might be America‚Äôs fault considering we‚Äôre providing untaxed hosts for it to mutate inüò¨but it is sad they‚Äôre all getting sick again‚òπÔ∏èI just don‚Äôt see where it blames the vaccine or COVID-19 (non variant)
201809	Happy to get my first COVID-19 jab today, but I'm angry that my mum is still yet to have her first. Corby Lakeside surgery had promised to get in contact weeks ago to arrange a special appointment because of worries about a possible allergic reaction, but still nothing.
109836	@able_pearl @Sea_2Lake @tina_reunite @Abn_RN No, the point is that you're much less likely to get COVID-19 if you take proper measures, including getting the vaccine, and if you do get it, you're less likely to need hospitalization and less likely to spread it because you're staying home and get over it faster.
111893	Admission: I was raised but a somewhat anti-vaccination father, and as a result, have always been very anxious about getting the flu vaccine.  To the point that I've never gotten it.  In fact, the covid-19 vaccine is the first vaccine I've ever received as an adult.
110991	@NationBreaking TSC has DIRECTED teachers to get COVID-19 vaccine within 7 days or be disciplined; they are not entitled to any RIGHT to their personal health? Will LEARNERS not vaccinated be EXPELLED from school? PARENTS not vaccinated barred entry from schools?! TSC must stop  being PUNITIVE.
111765	@AlexBerenson Can you please check into this Alex? I wonder if all the vaccines out are using fetal cells?
107796	@JWall714 @LAkersDLions @BleacherReport @evanmanivong @IlliniMGym You know how epidemiologist know that mRNA vaccines are low risk and effective? Because we‚Äôve used them on other coronavirus strains like H1N1. So please shut the fuck up and stop fear mongering if you can‚Äôt comprehend basic medical science.
110773	@Cleavon_MD @SusanSchutte2 So sorry to hear about this. My question for our @Cleavon_MD why are there people still dying from Covid-19 if we already have the vaccine?
107808	"Vaccine passports? They need to be free, private, and secure, but I don't think anyone has stepped up to the plate yet in the U.S. Who's gonna jump in to declare - ""There's an app for that!"" Until then we laminate. https://t.co/5OPToGYIlN"
110132	Strange how it is approved as long as no other treatments are available. Since there are other treatments, does that mean it isn‚Äôt safe or approved? Looks like it. Last vaccine approved has 49 years of testing‚Ä¶
107922	@paulabagwell3 @corybernardi @OslundArthur We'll see when you are exposed to the wild virus. I'd say you're the ignorant one. In previous animal trials for coronavirus vaccines all the animals died when they came in contact with the wild virus due to ADE. How confident are you feeling??
112185	Punjab has way bigger population then Sindh, but the #coronavirus cases in both the provinces are almost the same. Lafafa journalists, @NajamSethiShow ,  were saying that #SindhGovt has performed the best in this crisis, and had imposed a stricter lockdown. Where are the results?
109934	I stg on everything that is me I will absolutely 100% NOT get a coronavirus vaccine lmfaooo what a JOKE
108372	@GovBillLee And you are discouraging Covid-19 vaccination?   It‚Äôs personal, but the Flu vaccine is public?  How did you get so far under the thumb of the morons who worship the last president?  Why do you hate Tenneseans so much?
111746	‚ÄúOn the question of when a coronavirus vaccine may be developed and distributed, Trump said Americans ‚Äòcould have a very big surprise coming up.‚Äô
111969	@jasonmarcelTO @AliceMcGovern4 The follow up for the clinical trials have not even been completed...what do you not understand?This is still relatively new...we have also never mass vaccinated a human population for a coronavirus. You can't coerce people to take this vaccine...there are legitimate concerns.
111563	so quickly! The new coronavirus was only discovered a year ago and the technology that some of these companies are using to create a vaccine is cutting edge. During this Thanksgiving week I am grateful for this modern miracle. #GiveThanks
108236	You know it‚Äôs bad when they don‚Äôt even bother telling you how many are vaxxed and unvaxxed. They lost the plot
202262	There are 3 things on my Christmas list - rapid COVID testing, a safe vaccine &amp; a cwtch (hug) from my family. Hopefully one step closer today. However, like all Christmas wishes, the gifts have to get there safely, work after being unwrapped and come with batteries. ü§û#COVID19
112327	There is no ‚Äúafter corona‚Äù. Coronavirus is here and it‚Äôs going to stay, vaccine or not. We won‚Äôt wake up in 2021 and suddenly the virus has died. But we cannot live like this forever, enough is enough. We need our new normal to look more like our old normal
109782	Ever wonder why there's never been a Coronavirus v*xx before? How about why there is no vaccine for dengue?
109455	@Mark_Whitelegge It‚Äôs like people who voted for Trump: they think he‚Äôs a demigod who can do no wrong üòë coronavirus isn‚Äôt the only threat to the future of humanity, stupidity is just as bad and we don‚Äôt have a vaccine for the latter.
107909	It was never going to be different with this COVID19 vaccine. Why would it be?! I don‚Äôt understand the think pieces and perseverations... It was always going to be this way. The west first, and when they eventually feel like it: everybody else. And that‚Äôs that on that üôÑüòí
112282	@GregHuntMP Will you assure us within the relevant margins of safety that the Coronavirus vaccine will be safe and effective when the vaccine is ready and that it will not be released before that standard is reached? DW
111754	Has anyone had the AstraZenica vaccine? Just wondering how it went. Any problems afterwards?#COVID19 #vaccine #sideeffects
111428	People saying they won‚Äôt get the COVID19 vaccine when it comes out don‚Äôt even understand that it won‚Äôt even be AVAILABLE to them when it comes out. The vaccines will come out in waves &amp; certain people in certain professions will get it 1st.
108606	Going to be a long time before a safe vaccine is developed. Ref. Dengue vaccine approved and then failing. When vaccine is avail there are 8b ppl to vaccinate. we've had safe polio vaccine for 50+ years but ppl in some places not yet vaccinated. No guarantees of quick relief
112718	I am not hearing good things about this vaccine - We are not planning on getting the COVID-19 vaccine and I would not recommend it for children either. #COVID19
109954	@HouseGOP my question is why are chinese getting live COVID-19 vaccines?...why is USA pushing so hard for vaccination?...are these vaccines a match up for a future bug guaranteeing 100% lethality?...
108786	@empireofthekop So all the ‚Äúvoiders‚Äù say it‚Äôs to dangerous to restart this season but feck lets get it going in August - Coronavirus will be here till a vaccine is found next year and if we start 20/21 what if there‚Äôs a second spike and say a ‚Äúvoider‚Äù is top there wouldn‚Äôt be a fuss?
112372	Warning: It's too early to get vaccinated. The clinical trial of vaccines for novel coronavirus has not yet been completed.
109874	it the coronavirus vaccine is not free, the only point in developing one is solely for pharmaceutical company greed because a significant percentage of the population won‚Äôt be able to afford it, and the feds don‚Äôt care. Sick.
110740	All the money in the world is not going to keep Covid-19 out of the schools UNLESS it's to purchase a vaccine once developed and proven to work.
108920	@varun_mathur So you‚Äôre saying you created The Time Machine but couldn‚Äôt find the vaccine for coronavirus. Ok
110404	@Clint0nAnders0n @CTVNews You should actually do some research on the coronavirus vaxxx's they were producing after the SARS outbreak. It killed all the animals in the trials, and these vaccines they skipped the animal trials and went straight to humans. You can have my shot üòä
110717	@washingtonpost How about just realizing that the IFR of CoVid-19 does not justify getting an UNTESTED vaccine that has not been out for long enough to know the long term health effects!CoVid-19? We know its long term health effects in the real world. Taking my chances with it!
108902	@A2ZJIRWINKO Hello hypocrisy! You would think anti-vaxxers wouldn't be vaccinated at all given what they are preaching! I am not an anti-vaxxer for the record, since I got flu shots every year and I'm definitely getting the covid-19 vaccine too.
108030	Best news ever Barbara has her COVID19 vaccine tomorrow! Is there any better gift that this vaccine on her 90th Birthday! whoo hoo!
112089	@MattHancock didn‚Äôt know nurses delivered flu vaccines! ü§£This is what we get by not having clinicians/scientists leading our health and social care strategies.
112082	@bamableu @elsbet I‚Äôm going to continue wearing my mask until this coronavirus disappears until further notice my mask stays on and no vaccine üíâ
109904	Very nice piece parsing out why there are 2 different efficacy rates given for AstraZeneca‚Äôs COVID vaccine and what it means.
110971	Getting approved to get my vaccine by the end of this week and I want this vaccine üëáüèæü•∫Pretty please üôè
108076	If they come up with a vaccine for the #coronavirus, will the antivax parents let their kids take it?
202433	My husband has been working in the frontline since Covid happened and today, he is getting his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. üôèüèª Thank you, Lord!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠
110428	@KPSCALnews got my first does of the vaccine in Glendale. The process couldn‚Äôt have gone any smoother and the people could not have been any nicer. #COVID19 #vaccine #Moderna #glendale
110447	I have gotten the covid vaccine about 20 times now. 4 Pfizer, 12 moderna, 4 Johnson. Once I got my first vaccine, I started having cravings for it. There is something so great knowing I am reducing the spread of the coronavirus with each of them. I am feeling so empowered.
108973	...and if you‚Äôre going to refuse a vaccine against medical advice (like, from a real MD not a naturopath) please feel free to go live in the mountains or desert somewhere as a hermit and let the rest of us get along without your idiocy #bye #AntivaxIsAntiSmart #GTFOH

111837	Interesting that i couldn't see this shared on their twitter page @GOVUK If they actually want our views, it might be a good idea to share this information widely. #Vaccine #COVID19
110240	@yashar I‚Äôm glad they are working on a vaccine, however there is not currently enough data to suggest a vaccine will be necessary.I don‚Äôt get the impression that COVID-19 has what it takes to hang around long enough to justify a vaccine.I‚Äôm a no. I will re-evaluate if relevant in 22.
112342	these people won‚Äôt get the vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù but are first in line for monoclonal antibodiesüñïüñïüñïüñï
110265	@pritipatel Coronavirus is a hoax Priti, even David Davis said this was an exercise.The tests don‚Äôt work.The government is using psychological warfare against the population to spread fear.End game is to force the population into accepting vaccines and an RFID chip inserted into them.
109055	"@KeithDo59037497 @TiceRichard Matt Hancock ""This vaccine will not be used for children. It hasn't been tested on children. And the reason is that the likelihood of children having significant detriment if they catch Covid-19 is very, very low. ""So, this is an adult vaccine, for the adult population."""
110609	@thistlethwaite7 @MML88902406 @BBCNews Cancer, mutations of the cell, is far more complex to cure than a Coronavirus.It's also worth noting, other coronavirus vaccines were already being developed, so the COVID vaccines not only had the entire planet's effort put towards them, but much of the work already finished.
109506	@JRubinBlogger This population probably overlaps with the antivaxxers who will not take the #COVID19 vaccines. These people might need their own country.
110675	You need to educate them on how antibody-dependent enhancement works. Ask them if they knew ADE occurred in all the animal vaccine studies testing coronavirus. They‚Äôll quarantine themselves once they get it!

110577	@noahlove I live in Victoria and the vaccine police came to my place and gave me the vaccine and then they vaccinated my beta fish, who isn‚Äôt even a person. And then they started vaxxing all my houseplants, and gave my fish enough doses that he's protected for COVID-19 through to 649
112509	"@mchooyah '....prevents anything but an honorable discharge for servicemembers who refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine"" Sums it up for me"
112200	Isn‚Äôt it interesting? A vast majority of Trumplings and/or anti-vaccine individuals who get Covid, after being infected state they should have taken the vaccine. How many who‚Äôve gotten the virus, say they were correct and the virus and vaccine information is still a hoax.

109797	@charlieball801 @JazzFanAcct @andyblarsen @el_diamante3 They‚Äôre already finding different strains of the virus. That doesn‚Äôt bode well for a vaccine or shot. At some point we may be forced to face the fact that coronavirus is here to stay and we‚Äôll have to learn to live with it. Scary to imagine for sure if it ends up being the case.
108179	Is the R correct and the right formula to be using .. either way, it‚Äôs manipulated to get a vaccine and v-health passport out there #testbeforeinsertavaccine
108255	And what‚Äôs in the vaccines they are so desperate for us to take?Aborted baby cells and DNA.Nanotechnology? Do some searching. It will scare the crap out of you

201983	@just1leslie I had Covid-19 in the fall, and pretty bad. There was a chance to get the vaccine at a little facility that had a use or lose situation. I called my doctor and was told to get the vaccine the first chance I had.  I got does one and get dose 2 in two weeks.
112362	I‚Äôm feeling like the coronavirus is going to be similar to the flu in regards to it being airborne, perpetually recurrent, seasonal and likely needing annual booster shots to bolster immunity.We may never get past it, and likely need to just learn to adapt through it.
109749	Scientist don‚Äôt make a big deal about the flu because there is always a ready made vaccine present. There is literally no answer for the coronavirus at the moment. How do people not get that. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
112149	Even if You‚Äôve Had COVID-19 You Still Need the Vaccine Even if you‚Äôve had COVID-19, getting the vaccine may help prevent reinfection and lower your risk of getting sick again.(Feed generated with FetchRSS)
110472	@Stewy13 @PnPCBC @CQualtro a) I said it's like getting a flu shot. b) No one is forcing anyone to get the covid-19 vaccine to protect their heath &amp; others.

111075	@realTuckFrumper If the #COVID19 variants don't kill the anti-vaxxers, their cures will. Either way, it will expedite herd immunity. Only the vaxxed will survive.
111776	Looks like I'm eligible in the second group of 'essential workers'.Hopefully this means I can get my vaccine before the summer.
109382	@Why are they trying so hard to blame pro vaccine politicians for pressuring for the vaccine/mask and not coronavirus????
109071	On my way to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Remember; even after you get the vaccine, you are not immune. Please continue to wear masks and stay home, not only for you but for others. Their safety IS your responsibility.
110733	I hate these little scare tactics...vaccine don‚Äôt prevent you from never getting covid it‚Äôs like the flu shot. You may get the flu after getting vaccinated but you may not get as sick or die from it. It‚Äôs the same for the covid vaccine

107819	Today‚Äôs #coronavirus briefing is a big #FluVaccine ad/push. What the hell is going on @POTUS? The flu vaccine is dangerous and has low efficacy. Your Task Force is already pandering it as a requirement for the fall along w an agenda to reduce vaccine hesitancy.  #VaccineAgenda
109972	@RobertKennedyJr @TLAVagabond no #vaccine for me, i am not a #guineapig, thex couldn't exctinct the flu and still no #vaccine against #HIV and other #disease, so it's stupid to believe that they have a vaccine against #COVID19 in 5 minutes compared to other deseases
111044	This is another reason vaccine passports are a joke. It's not the bubonic plague, and everybody who wants a vax soon will get one (I'm getting my first shot today, for example).
109740	Twat is back from his holidays.  Lies! There cannot be 100,000 people stupid enough to take a vaccine that we know is untested, rushed &amp; where the vaccine manufacturer has no liability for any side effects or death. @MattHancock please stop taking us for idiots. Keep yr poison.
108966	250,000 people in the U.K. have volunteered and are in trials for the coronavirus vaccine, is it just me that thinks they are crazy
108224	Why a vaccine for a virus less deadly than flu? And why give flu vaccines when effective rate is so low? Viruses mutate. Vaccines cannot keep up with mutations. Are vaccines a way to accomplish Agenda2021 &amp; Agenda2030? Heard of Georgia Guidestones? Research &amp; trust in Jesus now!
108799	@BBCBreakfast We need to do all we can to stop the Spread of Coronavirus until the Vaccine makes us safe
111238	@DancerDad @zxcvbnlkjhgf The #COVID19 virus has not never been in circulation is hidden in the vaccine explains why they want you all vaccinated , so you think am just bs you all the timejust wait you will see soon enough#CovidVaccinehttps://t.co/Hxnva1j7qH
110642	@GovMikeDeWine When are you going to wake up Governor?The cure has always been here and vaccines are not necessary.  It can be taken profolacticly and protects against other viruses too.I voted for you, but make no mistake, I will never vote for you or John H. ever again!
109520	That's what herd immunity is all about: those that are physically unable (not paranoid conspiracists -- they don't get a pass) to receive the vaccine are then protected because everyone else got it.
111122	Lockdowns never work lol same with vaccines. History tells us the only way out of this is letting everyone get the virus. Survival of the fittest.
110812	Preparing us for when we're allowed to drive only on certain days.Wakey-wakey!Reject the vaccine certificate. It's the gateway to the social credit system the NZ govt. has planned; like the one used to control all citizens in China.#Covid19NZ #LockdownNZ #NZPol #NoVaxCertNZ
112940	reports here are stating that people are saying if you give me the vaccine for Coronavirus for free I'll take it. well they do give vaccines for free in supermarkets here, it is generally for the flu and while they get the vaccines that are kept on Ice they  r generally 2 yrs old

111414	Yeah this is fucking terrible the cons won't spend money on a safe and efficient rollout so it's gonna end up costing the healthcare system more with this patchwork raggedy process they are making up as they go along. Deplorable. I'll be lucky to get a vaccine this year ü§∑

112101	I had the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine over a month ago and had no side affects. I would still take the chance on the J&amp;J vaccine. The risks are low considering the risk of coronavirus. Just happy I am vaccinated and all my loved ones are too or in the process.

108403	... the currently available vaccinations for protection against respiratory illnesses do NOT protect against coronavirus. COVID-19 is such a new and unique pathogen that it requires its own vaccine, and researchers are currently working on one targeted for coronavirus. (2/2)

112730	@mjrowland68 @GregHuntMP @BreakfastNews Don't you think it's rather strange that the flu vaccine is compulsory for aged care workers but the coronavirus isn't?
111475	@LexyDKat @SheriLoCascio @mimimcg07 The science is there. A commitment to safety via nationwide vaccine is not there. This virus has been allowed to mutate. Just as a person vaccinated against the flu can get the flu, a person vaxxed against Covid-19 can get the virus, since it also mutates.

I DIDN'T go through months of masking, gloving, eye protection &amp; Lysol spraying just to get a vaccine &amp; STILL get #COVID19!

109351	@nikoCSFB I got the Pfizer mostly out of pressure, but I'm also a front line worker who has likely already had Covid19. So knowing I've had the shot and my immune system has dealt with this virus I feel confident not getting the booster.

109005	@CathyBilsky @mmpadellan Oh please. The vaccines don‚Äôt have any virus or other infectious material in them. They cause your body to make copies of a harmless piece of the coronavirus, so you will not, and cannot, get COVID-19 from the vaccine.
109059	This will clear the wrong notion surrounding this matter and put the facts in place that the covid19 vaccines are still under clinical human trials and those so-called vaccinated are human test subjects to this whole process whether voluntarily or forcibly done.

So it's been 40 days since I had the Covid-19 and I'm absolutely fine.#doncasterisgreat @jomcd101 https://t.co/GPE6i63WT6

202046	@NathanMackBrown I know two people who are still wearing masks and have not had coronavirus, my wife (of 54Y) and I. My wife‚Äôs sister and brother in law, same category. All current with vaccine.
108060	I know please explain that to me too! The media has put so much fear out there, Ppl‚Äôs brains aren‚Äôt working properly, or maybe they want to get in data bank, then be forced to get vaccine with chip &amp; be owned! Who knows!
108274	If the Chinese COVID-19 vaccine is not approved by the Namibia Medicines Regulatory Council (NMRC) why is it here? Why the hype? ü•±ü•±üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉ What message is our government sending out there?
108940	"I hope these vaccines wont he shared as ""party souvenirs"" like SOB Agunbiade wanted to do. Or hoarded like Covid-19 pallatives.Anyway, I foresee the frontline health workers going on strike when the vaccine doesn't get to them. Nigeria doesn't fail to disappoint."
112936	I saw a tweet that Discovery is going to do this - Purchase vaccines for its members (I am one). It‚Äôs morally repugnant. I don‚Äôt mind accepting it but only if they are taking the load off government to focus on vaccinating those who can‚Äôt afford it. .@_HassanF

108220	My cousin doesn't want to get the #COVID19 #vaccine as he has concerns.  He also believes the Earth is flat, sooo yeah I'm not listening to him one bit.
112517	Can somebody explain this ‚Äúblack people getting powers at the end of the year‚Äù joke. I‚Äôm assuming it had sum to do with the covid-19 vaccine? Ion get it tho.. why that date, n why the hell y‚Äôall think we would get powers üòÇ
110689	With the loud outcry of the world to demand a 100% #effective coronavirus vaccine #immediately, I'm rather surprised I have not heard from the animal rights activists not alleging a possible #animaltesting move. Surely, I should think there must be some animal testing going on.ü§î
111195	Oh Christ then let‚Äôs get going @GovCanHealth because there are many developmentally disabled teens and kids with cancer and fragile health or high risk indigenous kids and BIPOC who NEED to get this just as badly as the elderly #covid19vaccine #cdnpoli #onpoli

109463	Is this legal? What rights does Khan have to push a vaccine without medical experience. He doesn't know if anyone will have a reaction. Does he have access to our medical records to push this as safe Y has he got traffic wardens out in force during lockdowns when nobody can work
109575	I don't regret getting the vaccine when I did but now yeah I kind of regret getting the vaccine when I did.
107828	My Mother has been a rock star following our families recommendations to stay home during this pandemic.  She has not complained once. She just got an appointment next week to receive her second COVID-19 vaccine and I could literally just sit here and cry happy tears all day!
112894	@Blue_Texas2020 Stop with the conspiracy bullshit.  There are like a dozen reasons why there isn‚Äôt an HIV vaccine, but here‚Äôs the top reasons:1. The human body has no ability to form a natural resistance to HIV, but does to Coronavirus.  Vaccines enhance your body‚Äôs natural defenses.
112720	If I was a parent I would never send my kid to school outside during pandemic. I have graduated from college already and my parents said if I was till in school/college they would never send me. Without vaccine we are all in danger.

111009	Why is @BillGates suddenly acting as the Chairman of the world ? Or some scientist who can save the whole world ? N why does Indian PM @narendramodi have to be obeying him ? Bill's dollar Bills wont get a vaccine instead it will keep hanging like windows.
202326	I've just been told by a relatives carer that if you had covid19 within the last 28 days you can not have the vaccine i had to cancel my relatives appointment and this as been confirmed
108088	This is one of the hardest stories about Covid I have had to read. If you are offered a vaccine please go get it.

Vaccination is our protective cover against Covid-19. https://t.co/hsSGxgK8UO
109967	So, if anyone is interested, so far I am just very, very tired from my second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. I do also have a sore arm. I haven't taken any pain relief meds yet, but I've been tempted.For context, I got the vaccine last night at 6 p.m. PST.
202192	So y‚Äôall want me to take this COVID-19 Vaccine, but still got the boarders open to welcome a NEW STRAIN WE DON‚ÄôT GOT THE VACCINE FOR?!?!? https://t.co/LWM6zs2KUr
108844	Would love to see an explainer in simple terms why the ineffective vaccines were made in countries run by regimes I don‚Äôt like and why this exactly feeds into my prejudices.
108153	I think if mainstream media wanted more credibility during these times, they could frame their top stories with ‚ÄúAnother record-breaking and deadly weekend in America as Coronavirus cases are up, however, Moderna Labs has said it‚Äôs in Phase 3 of vaccine trials...‚Äù Just sayin‚Äô.
110078	@DrJohn76533054 Bill Gates is evil. There is no coincidence that he owns the patent on the Coronavirus, has been working and funding to make nano microchips for vaccines,  is the largest individual contributor to the WHO and just happened to be building 7 labs. Come on...
201936	@craigsketo @CaptainLadybird @ProfTimNoakes I‚Äôve never had a vaccine in my life &amp; I‚Äôm 58 yrs old. I caught Covid-19 last year and was so sick that I made my peace with God! I was ill for 3 weeks. Then started feeling better. If it‚Äôs my time to pass, it will be up to God, not the government.
107933	I've said it before and I'll keep saying it:Why is it the #covid19 vaccine can be fast tracked and now we have pills but potential cures for #HIV/#AIDs, #Herpes, #Hepatitis, and other such viruses are not?People talking about a pandemic yet herpes infects 90% of the world.
108856	this is a real family and beyond scary. i am not pro nor anti vaccine but i still think this is devastating. and usually idc ab the internet but this üíî
110509	Get the vaccine and continue to stay home? Nah, ppl ain't going do that. There is no stopping the spread of this virus in the USA. JMO, but I hope the vaccine gets us to the point where catching the virus doesn't lead to hospitalization or death, cause it's not going away.
112591	@PatrickChristys just sit it out for now there will be no holidays this year, NO ONE even the vaccine suppliers can give long term data, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs being gathered in these roll outs BUT there are casualties look up coronavirus yellow card system. @talkRADIO #NoPressure
110708	It‚Äôs so odd reading headlines like ‚ÄúRussia attempting to steal coronavirus vaccine research...‚Äù. 2020 really is a movie. But a super cliche and really bad one. Like, the year that Murderer clowns ran the street. That would fit in 2020 seamlessly.
109008	@larrybrilliant @DrTedros So it will take WHO 2 CENTURYS TO GET A VACCINE FOR COVID19 LUCKY THE STARTED IN EARLY JANUARY WHEN THEY WERE LYING TO US IT WASN'T EVEN TRANSMITTED FROM HUMAN TO HUMAN. JUST MORE WHO DENY ATTACK MISDIRECT DENY DENY DENY ATTACK MISDIRECT DENY DENY DENY ATTACK MISDIRECT
107973	There is not going to be an effective vaccine. Covid is here to stay we need to have long term plans laid for this now, not later. Invest in a hardened NHS and more viral research before it's too late again. #ProtectTheNHS
111716	@Markfry809 I‚Äôm beginning to think Trump‚Äôs resistance to COVID19 may bode well for research into Adderall as a vaccine. While he utilizes constant testing on those anywhere near him, unlike what he advises for the rest of us, I‚Äôm still surprised he‚Äôs escaped so far. And, no, I don‚Äôt care.
112504	Hey, guys, I know I said that I would be streaming tonight, but I recently got the COVID-19 vaccine and my arm has been hurting pretty bad. I promise my steaming schedule will be back to normal next week. Thank you guys for waiting! üòä
110443	@msanonymousme There will never be herd immunity if reports from Hong Kong are correct. It seems someone who survived Covid-19 now has it again. We need a vaccine. Period!
202414	SF residents: you may be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine today, even if you aren‚Äôt under State guidelines.I am and on Tuesday, 366 days after the State of California‚Äôs first shelter order, I will get vaccinated to protect myself and my community. Beginning of the end üôå
108756	Yup. So ppl please, don't go vaccine shopping if you are offered Moderna. Moderna is as good as Pfizer. We cannot do vaccine shopping in the middle of a public health crisis.
108706	According to Donald Trump, the coronavirus, labelled #COVID19, will die out once temperatures increase. And since when is he such an expert on virology? We're not 100% safe until we develop a solid defense, i.e. a cure and/or vaccine, fact, seriously shut this buffoon up already.
107834	Before any progress can be made against the Coronavirus, we must be rid of Trump. I don't care how it's done but he has to be dragged out kicking and screaming as we know he will. It has to be done now as we are running out of lives and the time it takes to secure a vaccine.
201953	Senior Citizens aspiring for the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine face problems at Joda CHCBecause of the lack of a system by the CHC Joda the senior citizens of the mining town of Joda facing problems in getting their second dose of COVID-19 vaccination.
112065	@YouthfulScrub @MoAfrica_ @CNN We don't have any coronavirus vaccine approved for use. The Oxford vaccine which is being tested is one of what is considered the most promising. All the test monkeys contracted the virus.
110343	Herd immunity's key to humanity's evolvement as a species.Yet we couldn't talk about it. Were ridiculed and told lockdowns are only way until a vaccine.We're the most advanced civilizations in history and two-bit political and science advisor thugs have you living in fear.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

108204	the coronavirus at all. This vaccine uses its specific proteins to cut down on all the proteins that the body brings in, allowing the natural and important proteins to come in, but not allowing dangerous ones like the virus. The reason the vaccine has any effects after (cont.)
201890	@rabiasquared Yes! I was diagnosed with COVID19, just this week. I have had all my vaccinations so the symptoms are mild. When a booster comes out and my doctor says I need it, believe me I will get the booster. This virus is a SOB!

110947	@JenJJams @IlhanMN How many people lost their jobs during the pandemic and how many Americans are facing eviction? Trump did nothing. He said that he‚Äôll not take responsibility for the spreading of coronavirus. Now he wants to take credit of the vaccine. He did nothing.

108556	@NSWRFS Why? It‚Äôs a proven fact the vaccine does not protect you from getting COVID19 , a virus with an OVER 99% survivability rate if you do get it, or from spreading COVID19.
112171	@SenatorRounds Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

109179	When this ‚Äúman‚Äù gives up the monetary incentive he has for ALL to be vaccinated.. maybe we‚Äôll listen but not until!!  This is the man that made millions on HIV?!?  Wake up people!! Fauci makes money on every single vaccine!!

111988	If there would be an inevitable demand for this vaccine, private industries would take on all the risk and invest their own money into creating a vaccine. No burden to the tax payer. Smh
111508	@FaheemYounus How about cross-immunity after having several times vaccine for seasonal influenza? Or do they not count cause one has had to have some #coronavirus infection to get some immunity against #SARSCoV2 ?I don't know if influenza vaccinations in Finland include #coranavirus'es.
107874	Hardly anyone is seriously going to quit their jobs over something trivial like vaccine requirement. We can mandate these everywhere, no problem
111661	@fmanjoo The Daily had what I thought was pretty condescending episode yesterday on how some people will probably not get the Coronavirus vaccine when it comes out. But... in these circumstances, suspicion towards a vaccine that comes out in this regime seems very reasonable.
111422	@Rothbard1776 NyQuil lessons the symptoms of colds, all kinds of cold, not just coronavirus colds‚Ä¶ so is this vaccine at least as good as NyQuil? ü§° If ‚Äúproviding protection‚Äù from a virus makes you a vaccine, then isn‚Äôt NyQuil a vaccine too? Like a 12 hour vaccine! ü§°

109533	Tgese are very very underreported.Hank Aaron just took the vaccine 2 weeks ago. I have heard an immunogist say deaths will occur 2 to 3 months after the thanatos vax
107857	@WalshFreedom And the vaccine at this point in time is the only way to some kind of freedom and will ensure the hospital system will not close their doors to everyone, not just COVID. Don‚Äôt forget SARS and MERS are a coronavirus so scientists have been researching these vaccines for years.
110639	@TVNewsHQ @realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters Why China try to steal from low grades while China herself is far advanced in Covid19 vaccine?   How stupid that would be?

110705	I don‚Äôt know why this in particular has me shocked considering what I know about the Trump administration and how vaccine distribution has been going so far, but like..... wow.
109053	@DonaldJTrumpJr I don't see the reason why a Vaccine Passport is needed. When you get your vaccine you get a CDC issued COVID-19 Vaccination Card. Once you get your first dose, you'll be issued a vaccine card. The vaccine card will have the name of the vaccine, the date received and where got it
108366	No idea how to feel about this, except to add that I am still in a nearly month long wait to get my booster shot in the neighborhood with grad student housing.
109839	Coronavirus already came around once this it's 2nd time this fall n winter will be 3 but then we're going to be against the vaccine that's going to harm our children from our daughters not being able to conceive n our sons with low sperm count
110111	@dugdale1863 @LPrivileged @Conservatives @MattHancock @nadhimzahawi You obviously aren't seen the amount of coming forward after the vaccine having #COVID19 like i said even hospitalized i don't get why @MattHancock is being silent about post-vaccine POSITIVES there are hundreds if not thousands #ToryScum #ToriesOUT #QuitHancock
201903	Welp, this might be itMy grandma who i‚Äôm very close with just got Covid-19We‚Äôre one room apart, and she‚Äôs living with my family rnI hope that she‚Äôs okay, she‚Äôs double vaxxed + boosters , but I haven‚Äôt gotten the booster yet and my vaccine was almost a year agoWish us luck
112603	@Cherry3142today @BernieSanders This is the equivalent of, 'I got coronavirus and survived, so no one should get a vaccine after me. They should suffer like I did.' If you understand the pain of debt, have some empathy for those who are still suffering.
108897	@JoeBiden Yeah get vaccinated then catch the Coronavirus because this vaccine don't work so shut the hell up president With Your lies
111962	To all the News Media‚Äôs said Trump would not get a vaccine for COVID-19 within a year like he promised and he‚Äôs delivered two...WHEN are y‚Äôall going to say Thank you President Trump? You may not like him but he delivered!!!  If you can‚Äôt say it to Trump don‚Äôt take it his vaccine
111074	"""These vaccines are only associated by the name"". If someone is dealing with an autocratic or totalitarian regime such as Putin's they will always be duped. Always. It may sound absolute; yes! for some reason it is ""Always"". Just don't do it."
108722	#aktuonlinexam But @vpathakin says that he has consulted with every college affiliated to aktu . So , i assume our college director's voices are suppressed ...üôÑBecause my college director supports online exams and teaching till everyone gets vaccine or covid-19 ceases.

108547	Will you get the Coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available??It‚Äôs a HUGE no from me!!! #coronavirus #CoronavirusVaccine #COVID19 #NoVaccine
112712	@CNN So its as effective as the yearly flu vaccine we all are supposed to get. Doesn't guarantee immunity, but is enough to suppress it till next year.In other words, the coronavirus vaccine may be just another flu vaccine. A yearly dose to keep the immune system chuggin along.
112498	No I don't want a shit vaccine that only does 2/3 of the job. I've played the columns on a roulette table many times &amp; lost. Why are Australians getting a vaccine that only has 62% efficacy? #auspol #COVID19 #coronavirus
112617	@BartlettChrisJ @Gurdur the entire economy on the prospect of a suitable coronavirus vaccine in any particular time frame.  If we get one, great, but I think it would be unwise to count on it.
112436	"@LexiLan18078330 @Oregonian @MrAndyNgo COVID-19 ""vaccines"" are designed to do is reduce your symptoms if or when you get infected. They are not designed to prevent infection, they do not give you immunity against SARS-CoV-2,"
201899	Grateful to be getting my second vaccine dose today at one of #Berlin‚Äôs former airports. I‚Äôm at the back of the very, very long queue which snakes through the trees and car park before getting to the terminal.

112531	@ntsikimazwai Comparing Covid-19 and HIV is done deliberately to get us talking, awake, and eventually to get why the government is forcing us to take the vaccine! Why taking the vaccine still don't immune one from getting Covid-19 and spreading it!

108922	The flu vaccine will not provide protection against the Coronavirus but can help ensure you don‚Äôt end up with a weakened immune system leaving you susceptible to other infections such as the Coronavirus. Please contact us on 01633 612438 to make an appointment.
110813	Did Fauci and Walensky seriously just say that if you get vaccinated and are hit by a car after, a doctor is going to fill out a Vaccine Adverse Event  report and the CDC is going to adjudicate that an adverse reaction to a vaccine?  Can they show us such reports?
202245	Yesterday I have received my second anti- COVID-19 vaccine! On both occasions everything went very smoothly, I m feeling fine! A big thanks to the Hungarian health service for its  hard work against the virus!
109198	@ksorbs It's time for parents to start taking education in their own hands.I know many who are doing so now because of Covid19.  They see first hand what their children are being taught, and they don't like it!Bill Gates needs to get out of Education with Common Core, and vaccines!
109259	After they‚Äôve messed up literally *every* part of the response to the virus, they put this incompetent idiot in charge of rolling out the vaccine. Don‚Äôt make any plan before 2024 at this rate ü§¶üèª
108580	@PinoyAkoBlog @attyharryroque @attyharryroque if not for your BFF China there is no need for Covid-19 vaccine
111530	I think that we should give the COVID-19 vaccine to all the people in death row so they can be the  guinea pig for all of us. Doctor and nurse should not get it because if they get it and die who is going to take care of us??#COVID19 #vaccines #DEATHROW #oppion #Colorado
107956	What did people want trump to do when coronavirus came to the u.s.? Did they want him to get into a laboratory and start making the vaccine.  Blaming him for everything is ridiculous.  It was NECESSARY to shut the country down.

112581	Didn‚Äôt Justin Trudeau say that the vaccines would arrive in Spring? they‚Äôre acting like herd vaccination is going to be possible when studies have found less than half of the population would actually get the vaccination and feels comfortable with it.
111493	-Mikola, you wanna take the vax?-No. -Everyone must take it. -I will not. -Next variant can be deadly.-I dont care, I've already have had the virus.Now in Ukraine they use non scientific information to inflict fear, to make people take the vaccine.#COVID19
111319	Those people who don't believe there's a #COVID19 virus, or it's *just* 'flu because they don't know anyone personally who has died from it. However, although they don't know anyone personally who's died, the vaccine is a killer. A form of eugenics ü§Ø
109155	@Steele_Ink @HarleyPeyton @DanCrenshawTX So ADE has not been seen in COVID-19 vaccines, but it has been seen in RSV, measles and the dengue vaccine
112150	I personally do not blindingly trust the Covid-19 vaccines like the silver bullet. This is due to all vaccines we have are not perfect ones and at the same time, the coronavirus has aggressively evolved and mutating all the times, and these viruses seem to never give up, but they
111675	This is true with COVID-19 ‚Äúvaccines,‚Äù as the shots do not make you immune; you can still get infected, and they do not prevent you from spreading the virus if you‚Äôre infected.
111489	So their vaccine reduced the absolute risk of covid by .24%.The world will end unless we get everyone hurdled into camps until they get these vaccines.
107812	@JonathanTorren9 @cmyeaton Did you know that we have never made a vaccine for a coronavirus successfully in humans? Most were mild. Only SARS and MERS were attempted to my knowledge. Both unsuccessful.
109896	I keep wondering why i feel like crap then i remember i had the maderna coronavirus vaccine yesterday. #Covid_19Glad,but yuk emoji.
109362	Even after the vaccine for covid-19 comes out it‚Äôs going to be so hard for the pandemic to come to an end when a majority of Republicans/white people are anti-vaxxers lol
108197	My guess is the next thing the NDP will do is trot out Don Davies to cast doubt on the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine. Their TDS is so out of control that they‚Äôll flirt with vaccine hesitancy. Watch. #cdnpoli #covid19
112751	@SihleMahamba @tshudi_alpheus Who said a vaccine is 100% effective? I said it 5 times now: You CAN still get coronavirus if you got the vaccine. It's just a lot more unlikely.
110359	Doesn‚Äôt matter how good our recovery rate is, India has failed miserably to contain the virus. The only country not showing any sign of slowing down and our PM is not giving any reaction to the exams    scheduled for next week. DOOMED til vaccines arrives. #COVID19India
111755	@ntvuganda 2 these days when we have not yet received the vaccine for coronavirus we can not be excited
110722	All anyone needs to k ow about the vaccine in one image.  Professor Hulk is behind it, so it'll all be sound.
112593	@aceofspades42 @talkingnewmedia @chrislhayes There‚Äôs never been a vaccine developed for any type of coronavirus. Stop dreaming.
109601	We are proud to be involved in the #Covid_19 #vaccine clinical study underway in #Oldham. This is such an important step in our journey to come through this pandemic. Thank you to our NCA Research team and our volunteers @NCAresearchNHS
201831	***VACCINE ALERT*** #ExperimentalVaccine #ItsABioWeapon This sent chills down my spine.  #This is not a game!!!!
202071	One dose of #Covid19 vaccine only provides around 30% protection against #DeltaVariant maximum. I don't know who told @NYCMayor only one dose of the vaccine is needed but it's misinformation. People need BOTH DOSES and to wait two weeks after last dose to be fully vaccinated.
110389	So, my dad has been given his first jab of one of the COVID-19 vaccines.He's no the most hygienic person (always coughing and sneezing everywhere), so I just hope he doesn't give me the virus, as I've managed to avoid getting it so far.
202099	I just got put on the At-Risk list for the Covid vaccine. I feel a huge sense of relief! I haven't seen my grandparents in over a year. It will be SO nice to finally give them a big, fully vaccinated (masked) hug ü•∞ #vaccines #vaccine #COVID19
201932	Very happy to be seeing the plastic #COVID19 dividers being taken DOWN at my school as teachers get their vaccine ! Still wearing our masks
111705	This will definitely make everyone get out there to get the vaccine. Can we stop with these articles?
109700	@SenRonJohnson @CDCgov Everyone who has had Covid-19 has antibodies and may not need a vaccine. After all, the claim is 1 in 3 people have had Covid in the US. That‚Äôs about 110 million of us.We are NOT vaccinated spreaders.My question is how many of the vaccinated never had covid?
109124	Matter of time isn‚Äôt it üò≠Don‚Äôt know what people think this will achieve. Until there‚Äôs a vaccine, it will just re-surface.
108725	@FrancLukas1 @jennyrachelpal @realDonaldTrump I would agree with you if we had 100+ years of knowledge like we do about the flu. I would also agree with you if we had a vaccine for coronavirus. Moreover, the coronavirus death toll is already way higher than the flu.

112076	To deal with the virus, it is impossible to rely on group immunity. Vaccine is one of the most effective means. However, in the United States, the vaccine may face another problem, with one third of Americans refusing to receive the new coronavirus pneumonia vaccine.
108102	It‚Äôs unacceptable that disabled people aren‚Äôt prioritized for the vaccine in CA.People can‚Äôt ‚Äújust stay home‚Äù when they need to attend regular doctors appointments and have to work to pay for said healthcare, especially because they‚Äôre disproportionately impoverished.
109902	I just received notification that I will be getting my first #COVID19 vaccine on Friday. I am so incredibly grateful for this opportunity I could cry.
111583	The sheer scientific feet behind this vaccine is extremely moving to read about, not only for the human ingenuity but for all the implications this technology has for cancer and other diseases
109796	It is RIDICULOUS they, who have denied the virus existed, took few to no precautions will get this vaccine first.  They should refuse to get it and insist it goes to local hospitals and nursing homes.
110935	@sarahkhan557 It‚Äôs crucial! I just learned from an Nobel laureate immunologist that the vaccine helps the body create antibodies in the bloodstream but the virus can still come in through the nose and attach to a cell as the nose has less antibodies (one would need a puffer vaccine).

202042	Okay, although if someone told me a possible side effect of taking the covid-19 vaccine was that I might become the Incredible Hulk, it wouldn't necessarily be a deterrent. As long as my CGI was good.

110269	Not gonna blame anyone for calling this overkill on the NCAA's part, but the players/program knew the rules and risk they were taking in not getting the vaccine/educating the team. This is sad, but completely preventable. Stop turning common sense into a political debate.

201861	"On ""Inject Disinfectant"" anniversary day, I am comfortable with the fact that I decided to go the route of waiting for the actual vaccine, as opposed to you know, injecting poison into my veins directly. It's debatable I guess, but I feel like I made the correct choice here."
107865	@senatemajldr why ??? You should not get it until the last American who wants the vaccine gets the vaccine. You are shameless and will be judged one day for everyone you have been complicit in killing &amp; sending to the streets. Disgusting.
111221	@62Seabee I have no interest in the vaccine, I had coronavirus I'll depend on my immune system. They don't know how long the vaccine is good for. They have said you can still get and pass coronavirus. Still have to social distance and where a mask. I see no purpose in getting vaccine
202381	My 87 yr old neighbor took the jab &amp; broke out w/SHINGLES all over her face, mouth n down her throat. Dr said was a reaction to the vaccine! Other elderly are getting sick from the jab! As for me n my house, my dog &amp; I will TRUST in GOD who created me! #MyBodyMyChoice
112315	@shakeyjs (Not liking it really!) Sorry you‚Äôre having to deal with Covid19 in this way. Hope all get well soon! Kids need the vaccine in most cases - with appropriate diligence!
112819	@thehill The coronavirus is ‚Äúgoing to go away without a vaccine ‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time.‚Äù
109854	A free online seminar takes place tomorrow evening to give an Islamic perspective on the COVID-19 virus and the vaccine:
111439	There is no going back without a highly effective vaccine. To date, we haven‚Äôt developed an effective vaccine against any Coronavirus, but maybe it will be different this time.
110369	May everyone out there stop using the word #jab? It‚Äôs stupid and sounds like an attempt to sound cool. #COVID #COVID19 #Lame
202075	You had me at Michael Osterholm. Dr. Fauci is having a good morning between the vaccine news and this.
111944	Not me getting on the NH vaccine website just after it opened up to my age group after midnight üòÇü•∞Scheduled for the 7th! Excited to get it but nervous because of my previous vaccine reactions. Got my epi on standby.#GetVaccinated #vaccine #COVID19 #coronavirus
111857	Excited to give my last public lecture for @SITNBoston! We will be discussing COVID-19 and how vaccines work! üëá
110052	Even if I consider #RussianVaccine a hoax in all probability I simply feel pity for those who still keep chest thumping #EvidenceBasedMedicine n ask questions like how could the do in three monthsCOVID-19 is exceptional virus 2hich needs to be tackled with exceptional measures
201928	If you get your first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine TODAY, you can be fully vaccinated by Christmas! Get vaccinated so we can #BringBackLouisiana and protect our friends and family this holiday season.
108029	*After 40 minutes I have COVID-19 vaccine*Now I only feeling my arm is pretty sour (Just like Cole playing Video Games) And The school just cancelled tomorrow's class. And told us to rest at home. So there is alot of people need to go home today......
111804	@ignorantdoteth If you actually did some research, they‚Äôve been working on the coronavirus vaccines for many years. Please stop with the blatant ignorance
108311	In order to make a vaccine there must be NO, mutations, coronavirus has SIX (6) mutations.  I‚Äôm not anti-vaccine but knowing corona has SIX mutations, NO way people should take it.
112841	Australians will be among the first in the world to receive a #COVID19 vaccine, if it proves successful,The vaccine will be produced in Australia and every Australian will get a free coronavirus vaccine dose. #covid19australia #covid19au #covidvaccine #coronavirusaustralia

112067	@TrumpWarRoom @TrueAmericans4U Just think about what the Democrats are doing they‚Äôre actually hoping people keep dying of the coronavirus before the election. You don‚Äôt hear them hoping and wishing the vaccine comes out.
112031	I actually was wondering why some Mullah has not raised the halal flag yet, and barred Muslims from taking a haraam vaccine. üòÉWill be interesting to see how many Muslims refuse to take the vaccine, and risk getting Covid.
112012	This is VERY important. I, too, wondered how a vaccine could be as safe, in 10mths, as 10yrs. My (amateur) research provided some obvious answers that, as an amateur, I had not even considered. 10mths IS akin to 10yrs, due to FOCUSED process administration and funds availability.
110833	A message to vaccine fascists. If your vaccines work then what's the issue and if they don't work how is giving it to me gonna make it work better?This is about authoritarianism and the lemming mentality of simple minds like yours.#cdnpoli #Elxn44 #elexn44
111839	Smallpox started circulating in the 3rd century BCE. Edward Jenner developed the first smallpox vaccine (the first *ever* vaccine) in 1796. It took until 1980 to eradicate smallpox. We may never eradicate covid, but if we do, it will *certainly* not be in any of our lifetimes.

110585	@bradswail @G_lame3 My cousin's friend in Trinidad got the COVID-19 vaccine and it turned Greg Casar's dad into an uber-wealthy Iranian in 1979. Just pray on it and don't be bullied.
110716	Not wanting a #COVID19 vaccine doesn‚Äôt make you an anti-vaxxerIt just means you don‚Äôt want a #COVID19 vaccine, and there are good reasons not to want one
112157	Getting really sick of explaining a basic fact: vaccines do not prevent mutations. In fact, they increase mutations. This is totally uncontroversial. Next, there is no way to stop mutation of the COVID-19 virus. None. Please stop the nonsense.
108115	Calling all the folks who have been following the COVID-19 crisis in CA prisons (especially @SharonDolovich @aaronlittman @WDavidBall @mjschlanger): Why do you think we're seeing judicially imposed vaccine mandates in NY and OR but not in CA?
109633	I wonder how much money these companies are making if they make it so every person on Earth has to take their vaccine every 6-12 months
109128	But the vaccine you know ...... and I‚Äôm not even anti vaccine, but this is too obvious! #COVID19 #coronavirus #Covid_19
112325	@barryonash @dangerboyz407 @BernieSpofforth That's not true. How come in Florida you'll get fined $5,000 if a business asks you for proof of a Covid-19 vaccine? ü§îI just went out last night to a concert and only one person was wearing a mask and nobody asked me about my medical history!
111210	Woke up at 4 AM to advise my good Brasil colleagues on COVID19 vaccines for kids, just got home after mentoring a junior faculty, speaking to media, getting out critical documents for our vaccine, meeting with Asian vaccine developers, calming Rach, this is the first thing I see
202065	Thanks to the lovely @SusanPiggott57 for giving me my second COVID-19 jab today. Fantastic again from @NTeesHpoolNHSFT üòäüíâüíâüíâ
109258	We are very peculiar population, on one hand we are protesting why vaccination is being forced on Africans, preaching anti-vaccine gospels and hoe #COVID19 is a hoax.
110328	Mercury sterility and dna changers in it no thanks it‚Äôs 98.8% curable don‚Äôt need vaccine for this hoax
110625	imagine louis now is super active on social media like niall and a coronavirus vaccine is made and life just slowly goes back to normal and on july 23rd the boys will announce that they are getting back to together in 2022. wow. we can only dream.
109873	"You REALLY want to see a generational change, wait til you get the ""shot"" Doctor Gates has cooked up for you. There was never an RNA vaccine, NO vaccine manufacturer has ever safety-tested the indredients (a real witch's brew), no animal or human studies for efficacy or safety!"
109576	@northumbrian_ @Matt_W1985 @berniespofforth @AwayFromTheKeys @JamesMelville As we track the daily progress of the COVID-19 vaccine across all countries, it's pretty likely Americans will get access to the vaccine. The more interesting ques. remains just how effctv it will be.
109301	‚Äúgood option for people who are immune compromised or haven't mounted an adequate immune response through the vaccine.‚Äù$REGN
202235	More than 200 million people in the US have received at least one dose of a #COVID19 vaccine. It‚Äôs not too late to make an appointment and get vaccinated today!
112750	@whippletom Ok @whippletom - but will the vaccine still work with high efficacy against ‚Äúthe perfect human coronavirus‚Äù?! Would be great if you could retrieve that tidbit of info from behind the Times paywall for us
108531	Yet they also say the vaccine isn‚Äôt very effective against the new variant ü§î blind leading the blind! Government is clueless!!!
111269	Saying things like this is going to lead to revolt. And as someone who has tried to remain extremely balanced and grounded throughout the entire pandemic if ANY measures remain after majority take vaccine I will be one of the first.They're either dumb or evil.
110168	Why is it literally impossible for me to find a place to get a Covid-19 vaccine??? I‚Äôm in Michigan, and every pharmacy I check won‚Äôt schedule me an appointment because they‚Äôre supposedly so incredibly booked up!!!
111071	Of course you dont have to get the vaccine, as someone who wants the pandemic to end, I am going to do so in order to help. Don‚Äôt say you want covid to end but won‚Äôt take the vaccine cause you use facebook as a reference.
202367	@amishclone @benjimast I am scheduled for my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday. After 1st dose my only side effect was a sore arm. Think the vaccine is a very important tool in the COVID-19 fight.

110188	@MayorOfTwitr @TeaPainUSA Not only is the covid-19 virus running wild but so is the stupid virus &amp; unfortunately the stupid will never have a vaccine.

111393	@TheDamaniFelder Good idea BUT if they will get just the REGULAR flu vaccine....and pretend to have taken the Covid19 vaccine?
109478	@BrianReymann @NolteNC I see so doesn‚Äôt this apply to just about any coronavirus which we‚Äôve known about since at least the 60‚Äôs? if vaccines/antibodies don‚Äôt protect you then we‚Äôre to be locked down and worship your mask god forever?Why not before?Absolutely bonkers, not logical.
111535	@johnjamesrando @ralph44668932 @shellity I haven‚Äôt met any one who is anti coronavirus vax and just that one. They‚Äôre either true antivaxxers and are against all of them or they‚Äôre conspiracy theorists who think alien pedophiles are going to track them with the vaccine.
111453	Who the hell is going to pay for AE‚Äôs if the parents‚Äô don‚Äôt consent? My kid certainly doesn‚Äôt have enough to pay for the bills from his myocarditis hospitalization and follow ups. These vaccines are immune from any financial liability. I‚Äôm genuinely curious how this would work.
202150	my coworkers and I are spacing out our second covid-19 vaccines so we don‚Äôt all end up missing work the same day if we have bad side effects ü§™half our coworkers said it was the same as the first, the other half said it was a day of fatigue, fever, aches, chills, etc.
111204	@JimJwbubba @TarheelKrystle The answer to your question is no, there has never been a vaccine for any coronavirus produced.  I‚Äôm sure as hell not taking the beta  Version 0.01

108676	@Vicster82 I will not be afraid of any vaccine that is given to me by Donald Trump. I will never get any vaccine that is given to me by any Democratic leadership. Never in my life have I had the flu never in my life have I had a flu vaccine. I will get the coronavirus vaccine b4 end of yr.
109884	When you get Covid will you take bed in the ICU or will you be that strong anti mask anti vaccine person and tough it out at home I truly hope so Ignorance is bliss
107813	Thalidomide is used today in the treatment of multiple myeloma, and it is very effective in the majority of cases. My mother took it for 10 months. It's not a vaccine, and there is no connection or comparison to any new COVID19 vaccine, unless you're a scaremongering COVIDIOT.

111686	So, this is a serious question but it may sound like it isn'tWill anti-vaxxers take the Covid-19 vaccine if they get sick?Or let their kids take it if the kid was sick?
107962	Dear #Antivax of the world, how do you like the demo version of a vaccine free world? Don't you plan any infection parties? #covid19 #corona #virus
112560	Have you asked the Fed Government what they are doing to rectify their bungled vaccine rollout, or why they haven‚Äôt opened up purpose built quarantine facilities? I‚Äôm just going to assume the answer to these questions is no, because you are not a fan of the truth/facts.
107707	@NoobRobot2 @AP No it‚Äôs not! It‚Äôs a vaccine you have to get each year weather you‚Äôve had COVID-19 or not! Flu shot isn‚Äôt a cure it‚Äôs a vaccine
110327	@donach69 @FrankPlutonium @paulmasonnews They cannot avoid the inevitable. Coronavirus is now an endemic virus. Even when there is a vaccine people will die from it. New Zealand is just delaying the inevitable.
112313	Maybe they should have just let COVID-19 run through the world one time??? I mean what kind of logic is that? Just don‚Äôt get the vaccine, nobody is forcing anyone to get it, including you.. Like When are these hoe ass bitches gonna shut the fuck up? They make 0 sense‚Ä¶
109562	@tvcoh4 @JoeBiden Coronavirus is like the flu.  It mutates and the vaccines are already ineffective and virus has run its course by the time vaccines are made.  Which is why we have 1,000 flu vaccines and influenza is still here to stay.
109282	there is not vaccine for sars,,,mers,,,ebola...so what makes you to believe there will be a vaccine for covid19?
110783	Just got my first COVID-19 vaccine shot at Walmart! And I even got a Mountain Dew Baja Blast, straight from Taco Bell! Am I awesome, or what? My second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for May 22nd, Pac-Man's 41st anniversary! Coincidence, perhaps? I think not!
109915	I feel like the COVID-19 vaccine is going to be how the Zombie Apocalypse begins.But, let the record show, I say this for every vaccine created recently ü§£ü§£ü§£
112850	"@suzost Good grief - for once I agree with Farrakan!Coronavirus vaccines are *all* potentially deadly due to the known fatal twist of ""immune enhancement"" - which has PLAGUED prior vaccines in the category.The idea of giving ANY corona vaccine first to blacks is ""you first"" at BEST!"
112913	@illumiwookie @CovfefeKatie Coronavirus isn't ebola. Even 200,000 deaths is low. Expecting to shut everything down until it magically goes away or a vaccine is developed is unrealistic, child-like thinking. This is a deliberate attempt by liberals to destroy America and blame it on Trump so he don't win.
111904	"""Let's give this [vaccine] to the whole world.""... ie we will enforce vaccinations globally.""There will be some risk and indemnification needed.""... ie this could hurt you but no you can't sue my ass.#coronavirus #BigPharma #BillGates #WHO"
109519	So many parents like myself have waited for this news: the CDC is officially recommending the Pfizer vaccine to children ages 5-11. Widespread vaccines are the only way we‚Äôll beat this pandemic, and I encourage all parents to get their kids vaccinated as soon as they can.
112758	Ffs fed up with this anti-intellectualism. Please get the vaccine. I get my second dose tomorrow, and I can‚Äôt wait.
108749	I'm surprised they are not using puppies and kittens to make this vaccine or better yet bats they should be using bats as the Covid-19 came from bats so let's use bats to create a Vaccine to combat Bats if that even makes sense just like their vaccine makes no sense
108209	It it's only 12%, why are there still mandates from Trudy? Why the hell is the tantrum-thrower-in-blackface getting in the way of a nation getting back to normal?If vaccine rates are anywhere near what the propaganda says, why are they still even bothering to advertise them?
112281	Wait until they start dying ( which they will)....do people still not think this is all about control.Keep jabbing your child or he can‚Äôt go to school...he can‚Äôt do anything...This is coming our way unless mandates/ passports  are STOPPED NOW
112640	I have taken the flu vaccine &amp; still got the flu. Why? There are different strains, they guess which strains will be available &amp; create vaccines for those. The strain you get may not be in the vaccine. A Covid-19 vaccine may not protect you. Practice wearing your mask now.
111650	Gouvernement Logic: thank the vaccine to protect you from the coronavirus but still can get the coronavirus and still transmit itüëÄü§îüòê..
110044	‚ÄúMy mom says that me getting the vaccine that I got literally saved my life,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt have known otherwise when I might have detected the cancer that my immune system had just picked up on.‚Äù
108674	@BraincoralMusic Yes which is why they ‚Äúextended‚Äù the coronavirus act 2020 for another 6 months,because if that ends,so does the emergency powers meaning no more vaccines.I just didn‚Äôt know if something had been announced about over 65s like they have for under 30s
107684	Garbage take right here. Get the vaccine. The only way we get back to anything even remotely close to a normal life is if we all get vaccinated. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the only way. Tired of wearing a mask? Want to travel? Want to hug your friends? Vaccine. It‚Äôs the only way.

111602	Arabs are so fucking racist and stupid they acted like coronavirus wasnt their fault ok bitch race for the vaccine then
107903	These covid19 vaccines are just like the flu shots. You'll still get sick, mostly moderately. Some, however, will get severe disease, need hospitalisation or even worse, may die. We have no data about how many will get severe enough to be hospitalised or how many will die...
110221	.@NYCMayor @NYGovCuomo Why is it still impossible to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination in NYC? Why are all the vaccine finder websites impossible to use? What the fuck are you people doing? Do you actually hold meetings on how to do things the worst way possible? ü§¨

110174	&gt; vaccines are not required for reopening&gt; we will only pause in-person learning if this very specific and unreasonable metric is metat what point do @chicagosmayor @janicejackson @ChiPublicHealth just come out and clearly say teachers and staff are expendable to them?
110123	@albertanbeech They believe this government, if Trump had won, more people would be against mandating the vaccine. Libs still might vaccinate their kids but it would be a personal decision. Even the CDC says Covid-19 is low risk for kids, so what reason are parents using to vaccinate them?
108306	@IiiLacour @_bethani @Mrknowitalll_ @BarkyBoogz Exactly. We never needed a vaccine before bc coronavirus was just mild colds so they never researched to make a vaccine until sars in 02 bc SARS was different and they needed to study it and create a vaccine just like now
110267	Ayan, ha. If any of these vaccine brands are offered to you, you should please get them already. Wala nang arte-arte pa.
109388	@senpaicoffee To further break it down for you since you are slow, once a variant comes out, we will have to adjust the current vaccine to address it. Its called Covid-19 because there were 18 previously known versions of the virus prior to the pandemic just not as deadly or contagious.
109132	Lmao this is the footage my local news used to show Seattle vaccine testing for Chinese virus. Is any of this real?
111267	I have four people who live in my house who are over 60 I'm a diabetic and to take the vaccine would we have to all take it at the same time is there a chance that if only one takes it that they could transfer the coronavirus to the others who didn't take the vaccine
110266	If after having the vaccine you can still carry and pass the virus on what is the point of the healthy and low risk having it ??
108385	Since 1947 to 2014 all indians wer collector and millenioer this problem is only from 2014 and Covid-19 chiniese virus spreading ONLY india rest are very wellGajjabDon't before twiting there is working only Italian salaves it cell
112374	Announcement:I  am relieved to announce that I just herd from my oldest daughter that my youngest grand daughter 5 years old, just got her #COVID19 vaccine 2nd shot.  One more to go, but he my adopted grandson is only 4 and has 8 more months to wait.
110646	@SariArhoHavren Who has the guts to take a vaccine developed by #China, that may not even be fully tested? I would rather have the coronavirus instead
110788	This pandemic will not be over until it‚Äôs over for everyone, everywhere. I‚Äôm calling on @Novavax to pledge their commitment to making sure the COVID-19 vaccine is distributed fairly and equitably around the world. #OneWorldProtected
112672	Do you all 'know' that the 'vaccine' they're working on does 'not' contain 'any' COVID19 samples, because it is 'invisible' so they claim, bypassing Standard Operating Procedure for vaccines. Isis
107675	This is classic Shingles, which is brought on by a stress to the immune system like a vaccine (any vaccine) and is only activated if you have had chickenpox which is a form of herpes. And if you already carry an HSV, this is a normal response. Stop fear mongering!!!!
111832	Hopefully With EXPEDITED Vaccines, So Everyone Providing Child Care and Being Cared For Is Protected.
111764	I really don't get the people commenting about Christianity. What he said is actually something we should think about. They're dying more than us but they brought the vaccine here. If this doesn't raise your brows then idk for you
112301	@NYGovCuomo Quick question Governor:If New York state residents have positive antibodies against the #COVID19 virus. Either being symptomatic or Asymptomatic, do they still need to take the upcoming mandatory Vaccine or is their Positive #covid Titer sufficient?If think ethically the later
111722	@globalnews first person who tries to FORCEFULLY inject me with a MANDATORY covid19 vaccine will Forcefully get a knife injected into their throat. My body my choice. Take away my choice, I‚Äôll take away yours even quicker. Trust that.
112112	@rose_2222223 @SkyNews Flu is not so highly transmissible and you're only contagious when you know you've got it. There's an established vaccine, it disappears in spring and requires less hospitalisation. Healthy people still get ill with Covid-19 and spread it, sometimes asymptomatically.
202205	Just had my Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine. Feel great and am sure this will soon be rolled out across Asia and the world so we can get back to something like the old normal. And normal teaching! üôè
110839	Very likely you will need a vaccine test to accept / keep a wage slave job in near future. Good move ‚ôü
108437	I too think junk food is awful but if it gets some dork to take the vaccine, then goddamn, time to make the effing donuts
108748	@JL4486 @BMoreBirdsNest valid to wonder, if a Coronavirus can be this troublesome, why wasn't there a general vaccine developed for it before?  We know this isn't a new family of viruses...only real difference with this one seems to be a longer carrier period.They've been studying these, why no vax?
111159	We will never see it because it doesn't exist. Rick is right...he keeps promising it like it will miraculously appear, just like the Coronavirus vaccine he promised.  Even if he did rush something through, I AM NOT TAKING IT! I will stay in my house until Joe get into office.
112154	@sfchronicle No Vaccine for me, my 27 children, or my #antivaccine queen @JennyMcCarthy! If they force me, I demand to speak to Covid-19 Vaccines Manager!
111666	At the direction of the Capitol Attending Physician, I received a COVID-19 vaccine shot today and I will continue my work making sure vaccinations are widely distributed in Wisconsin so everyone has safe and effective protection from this deadly virus.

110744	I worry that police resistance is being overblown, like so much of the reported reaction to vaccine mandates. If not, it's further evidence that lots of police think the rules don't apply to them. Which is bad.
111561	@hinaparvezbutt I do not think so that the Punjab govr. is quite serious regarding coronavirus but we should work together as a team as per  @shahjhan_malikk suggestion then we can beat coronavirus in no time Insha Allah.@shahjhan_malikk @hinaparvezbutt
109845	I'm sorry, it's going to take until July. Pehaps you should call Boris Johnson(who I have little use for) He's miraculously managed millions of vaccines in just weeks. We could do it too if there was ANY competence in conservatives
110724	@THEJERE I would get it. Look at the data coming out of Israel.It's a choice between an inactive virus in a vaccine vs live infection from coronavirus still circulating. I'd take my chances with the vaccine.
108866	@abc13houston So what, I want to know why I can't get a covid-19 vaccine shot ? Is it because I'm in a wheelchair and can't drive to the car only sites? Please tell me.
109068	"""Without a vaccine....around 200 million Americans would have to get infected before we reach [herd immunity]."""
110002	@JennieNichol @StephenNolan I feel sorry for the people out there whose only gratification in their lives is the kick they get trying to bring others down - they are the type that do nothing and take all. Wonder how many of them will refuse the Covid-19 vaccine
111887	üî•This is BATSHIT CAZY!!!! If someone decides they want to put a foreign object w/AI ability into their body, that‚Äôs their prerogative, but I‚Äôm human and I‚Äôm staying that way!! #WakeUpAmerica #AI #HiveMind #vaccine #COVID19 #HerdImmunity
109522	Its amazing no one in gov't or private industry pushed for a digital certificate for this and vaccines, and how no one ever thought this would be a problem.
109685	did my own research and apparently a bcg vaccine is a family of vaccinations, not just limited to tuberculosis. Long story short the translation I got was accurate they just didn't get the part where they spoke on Coronavirus. But They are speaking about a Coronavirus vaccination
112491	Yeah I‚Äôm not getting my second jab. What‚Äôs the point in getting it if we‚Äôre not gonna be freed anyway? Bollocks.
202443	FDA‚Äôs first comments on Pfizer vaccine highlights strong protection against virus within first 10 days of first shot. Earlier than first believed. #CovidVaccine #Pfizer #COVID19 #COVID
108907	Now we're told it could take THREE YEARS to come up with a vaccine for the Wuhan #coronavirus. Three years? The Corona Virus is as old as #pinkeye.
108577	"Obama, Bush and Clinton say they will take the COVID-19 vaccine publicly to gain public trust. What ""vaccine"" will they take - if any at all. Will Wuhan Lab - Funding Fauci be the one administering the vaccine? This is one way to insure I will not take the vaccine."
110033	@wikileaks Sir the vaccine ImoVax used against Rabies virus in Rabies infected persons is useful in treating Coronavirus patients. Please help spread this message and in eliminating this pandemic.
109768	They mandating a vaccine for COVID-19 but there now is a Delta and MU variant are you going to be protected or them ? I‚Äôm not an experiment nor is my body
111509	@closedforsummer @1350c Try and read what I write.I'm not anti-vaxx. I'm sceptical about a vaccination being isolated, discovered, tested and produced in a matter of months.I am not having the Covid-19 vaccine.I don't care if someone is vaccinated. I do care if I loss my job because I don't.
109897	@RN_Destiny Now they are saying that the vaccines may wane after 7 months. If vaccinated you can still can get COVID-19 and you can still pass it on. So what is the point of the vaccine? Don't think many know what's going on and the vaccine is a trial drug.
110541	The flu shot can make you feel unwell... honestly they should just delete this because it‚Äôs going to create more conspiracy around the vaccine
107679	@cnbcevents @megtirrell @NIH @NIAIDNews Meg! You are doing an awesome job reporting on the coronavirus and all the vaccines and medicines! Keep up the good work!
108154	If this is true, then why even have a Phase 3 trial if the vaccine is being approved before all trials are complete? ü§îü§î
111116	AstraZeneca was always a tier two vaccine. The ‚Äúget any vaccine‚Äù advice seems very flawed in hindsight. There‚Äôs a reason the Americans never approved it.
109620	@JoeBiden Masks? I‚Äôm not seeing coronavirus in my orbit. We are not admitting few if at all   In my orbit. And, we are not seeing any Coronavirus patients die in my orbit. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump we have tests, meds, ventilators, and now, vaccines. You have zero clue.
109568	Cuba made their own vaccine AND everyone is going to get vaccinated all while under blockade by the USA. Meanwhile the pandemic is getting worse in America
109532	@Jessica28000244 @redpop86 @science_cited Your opinion matters very much. Please keep sharing!! :)Our opinion, no coronavirus vaccine has ever been deemed safe. Don't think this will be any different. Faster they go, more unsafe it is, more mistakes made. No mandates = No concern
202224	I swear I feel like my arm is slowly turning to a painful brick after taking the COVID-19 Vaccine, seriously my arm is so soreüòñüòñüòñ
110228	Just like the #PPEshortage when a vaccine becomes available, there will be a shortage, we won't get any or we'll buy useless vaccines. Another #ToryCovidCriminalMismanagement in the making.
109991	@PMOIndia It is very difficult to encourage the people's to take the Covid-19 vaccine because of different rumours, for this my suggestion to GOI Please launch the INSURANCE POLICY for post vaccination period which will be covered disabilities and mortality because of any reason.
110875	@RexChapman Then he went on to compare the research being done for a vaccine to the coronavirus to the Manhattan Project in which the research ended with the death of a projected 225,000 people and nuclear warfare is still something we are worried with to this day. Not a good comparison.
111358	Hello, just want to say na the vaccine we have now for COVID-19 is for EMERGENCY USE ONLY. DONT GET ME START WITH UNG MGA ANAK NYO NA PA-VACCINE-AN COZ BITCH THOSE VACCINES ARE DEVELOPED AND FDA-APPROVED ALREADY.
109677	Do you have ANY idea how stupid you sound? Get an FDA approved vaccine (Regenerson NOT FDA approved) and you don‚Äôt get Covid19 or you get such mild symptoms you DON‚ÄôT have to go to the hospital!!  Stupidity will kill you!
109951	@isonwilm @AaronCanen @ostrachan @Antithesis_Pod Covid-19 has statistically been much worse than the common flu on a large-scale. The goal is to minimize the amount of deaths while we reach herd immunity. I agree, people should choose for themselves if they get the vaccine or not but there is no doubt that they have so-far...
201842	@JulesB_07 So very sorry to hear this Jules. In my opinion, all Police Officers, should have had a Covid-19 Jab along with NHS Staff. All frontline Workers.üò¢üôè
109083	@b51507829 I don't even understand her point? Like does she not understand that coronavirus is what causes the common cold, and SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly variant of the coronavirus? RNA vaccine research has been happening for nearly 2 decades. I don't...what?
111790	@BostonGlobe Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.

111138	Is there any sane person in this world who would resist to take a covid-19 vaccine ?If somebody resists, we don't want such creatures
111386	What if the vaccine fails and y‚Äôall gonna force us to take it?? I‚Äôm getting an attorney and a bail for you delusional bitches
109197	@livemint Coronavirus has to get their right to complain coz vaccine and lockdown weakens his business..
109171	The way to go is e-learning and contact tracing solutions during this covid-19 vaccine free period. It saves direct Dr contact with clients and it keeps educating possible. We have these solutions in case you share my view.
109284	Heads up - the vaccine helps to reduce / eliminate the symptoms of the #coronavirus -they don't know yet if the vaccine actually stops the virus from SPREADING. Plus - you need TWO DOSES. So until people QUIT DROPPING DEAD -we still need to wear a mask -practice social distancing
201924	First #COVID19 jab done. Wow! That sore arm kicks in fast! üò¨Superb level of care and welcoming staff from @nhscroydon_ My nurse, Karen, was wonderful - so helpful üíô#NHSheroes
202248	The weather is miserable, lockdown is still boring, but today is a better day than most - my mum has had her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.
110720	If Americans were a truly adaptive and compassionate people, we would all just shave our heads and not give a shit what our roots looked like until a vaccine was developed.But, we're only two months into this thing and already threatening Civil War.#COVID19 #MichiganProtests
109399	@ThePubliusUSA @AdamParkhomenko There isn't and never has been a vaccine for a coronavirus, not foing to happen with this one either. Been what 18 years since SARS? Where is that vaccine, how about MERS?
112900	@TomGPritchard @BigManPauly @RexChapman So it‚Äôs ‚Äòonly‚Äô 2-3 times as deadly as the flu but then add in the fact that we don‚Äôt yet have a vaccine for coronavirus and suddenly it‚Äôs about 10 times more deadly. AND if the vaccine is as effective as the flu vaccine it will still be 2-3 times as deadly.
109557	"This is what what you get when you search on the Mass. vaccine site  today and filter for  Only Sites With Known Availability:""No locations match this criteria."""
112692	Apparently scientists have never produced a single approved vaccine or anti-viral drug for ANY coronavirus. Betting the well-being of an entire country on the assumption there will be an effective virus is poor reasoning.
110885	And this is EXACTLY why @CalforNC told @SenThomTillis last night that he‚Äôd be ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù to take a vaccine. There is no conceivable reality on planet earth in which a safe and effective vaccine can be studied, approved, manufactured, and distributed within weeks.
202020	Moderna, Vaccine, COVID-19 Vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine - Chattanooga, Tennessee - Moderna Vaccine.  I will receive my 2nd dose on 1/28/21 at 3pm.  No side effects.  Arm mildly sore for 2... SafelyHQ https://t.co/LWfpaWHxCF https://t.co/XL6oaCpQCp
111753	The only acceptable reason to not get the vaccine is if you would physically die from getting it. Nothing else
110582	@MDWaters1975 @Annakhait 1.  Took Coronavirus seriously and prioritized vaccine.2. Infrastructure, our roads are crumbling and need repair.
111741	‚ÄúThe rules for Covid-19 vaccines are clear: Vaccine providers are not allowed to bill patients, period,‚Äù Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. ‚ÄúEveryone can get a vaccine for free, whether they‚Äôre insured or not.‚Äù
201951	@MKBHD @MKBHD ; I've been testing the vaccine for the last 2 years, and here's my review and final impressions.And thanks to @dbrand for sponsoring the video. Get your COVID-19 vaccine skin in the link below.
111559	If you took the vaccine, the vaccine works, and you go into the restaurant,you go into the bar,you go to the store,you go to the sporting event,and you go in there and someone else didn‚Äôt take the vaccine,why do you care?
108681	After the hype about Moderna‚Äôs mRNA coronavirus vaccine, I wrote about why Oxford‚Äôs vaccine, which instead uses an adenoviral vector, may be safer. Now AstraZeneca got $1 billion from the US to develop the vaccine with Oxford. Here‚Äôs the science of it all:
109051	So the same people who called this virus a liberal hoax and refused to wear masks will be the first ones to get the vaccine? I just want to make sure I have this right... Appalling.
107746	Yesterday, the University of Windsor announced mandatory vaccines for all students &amp; staff. Wondering why my Alma mater, @McMasterU hasn't done so. When did we start coming last, Mac? üòü
109435	If an mRNA vaccine was approved for coronavirus, it would be the first of its type. ‚ÄòIt's a very unique way of making a vaccine and, so far, no (such) vaccine has been licenced for infectious disease,‚Äô said Prof. Bekeredjian-Ding.
109980	Having worked in a vaccine lab before I hope people realize just how /hard/ and costly it is to even begin to test and research different hypothesizes.Microbial labs take time. From inoculating, to growing, to producing- thats days maybe a week depending on wht you're working on
108388	@LanaKay11 @SpringSteps @HerStr8RightTho @adrienne_haddad I took the vaccine so I would be protected against COVID19. Just like I get flu shots and tetanus boosters. You don‚Äôt want the vaccine? Fine. I got it so I could hang out in bars or fly with unvaxxed people. You made your choice to NOT get vaxxed. Don‚Äôt belittle me for my choice.
110361	@washingtonpost #Covid19 It's been here for years. Everyone has had it or is getting it. It's that we are testing for it now. We didn't before. The #Covidvaccine has also been in production and administered to livestock for years. Just research it then you will know.. #COVID19 IS NOT THE KILLER.
112283	Questions for #COVID19 #VaccineMandates 1. How does me getting vaccinate help?2. If COVID is so bad, why not just let me die like an ignorant idiot?3. How can the FDA possibly have long term data on a vaccine that‚Äôs only existed for 8 months?Sincerely,Had Covid, still here
112443	We don't know the severity of the coronavirus. Downplaying it is  detrimental to planning for the worse, and hoping for the best. Most worrisome of all is that there is no vaccine. It could take up to a year to get one. First, they need to  identify this particular virus.  Scary.
202382	Delighted to announce that I am being put on the waiting list to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. All that needs to happen now is for me to be referred for a Covid-19 vaccine. But, this is a first step and an important step in my journey to receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.

107940	But it is going to take them at least a year to get the vaccine to everyone? So would they start off in India
110335	Interesting.ü§î So Countries pay millions or billions for companies to make the Coronavirus vaccine in turn they charge for releasing it. Someone is making a huge profit here.
202036	I read online that you need to wait just for 2 weeks after getting Covid19 symptoms to get the vaccine , I had the symptoms but my report was negative and it's been 3 weeks now so I am gonna try and book a slot now.
108888	@GMB So @MattHancock @DHSCgovuk is it one jab or two? Do the poor get one jab and @Conservatives and their cronies get two?This mixed messaging and cronyism doesn't help the fight against #coronavirus or support the idea we're in it together!#VaccineStrategy

108825	@JillHoganRE @CBSNews Why after mo. being told are you &amp; others so ignorant what the vaccines will/will not do? Fully vaccinated people can get covid19!! They can get sick; they can spread it to others. Ea. time COVID infects someone it has potential of mutating beyond what vaccines can handle.
108067	We‚Äôve doubled down on vaccines, this keeps happening everywhere. Everyone needs to know after you get the vaccine STAY HOME for two weeks.  The data suggests that you are more vulnerable immediately after the shot for some reason... it does work well eventually.
112141	@Ddog10000 Because there is a *bat* coronavirus called BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/ that shares 96% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 across their entire genomes.So its got nothing to do with a vaccine construct. Stop looking for imaginary plots when the obvious is sitting right there

107918	@RenatusVoltaire @AlexBerenson @gummibear737 @EthicalSkeptic Which explains why we never get to ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù with the yearly influenza vaccines. Those shots, just like the ones for Covid-19 are meant to protect the recipient only.

110180	@Sapere_vivere this is not about all vaccines; this is specifically about the COVID-19 vaccine; even if they give away those patents they still make a lot of money -- when the whole planets has to be vaccinated the wallet is rather big
110769	So we accept that COVID-19 is not a one and done and now will invest in better detection, monitoring and presume vaccine distribution.This is what COMPETENT government looks like.
111707	Trump supporters won‚Äôt get the vaccine but because they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it but don‚Äôt hesitate to house 4 hotdogs for dinner.
109303	@ty_pharmer @Alec_Zeck so explain to me why are we signing wavers ? please tell me,show me proof why we need to sign a waver for the covid-19 shot with boosters if they are here to help us? Is it because once you sign that paper no one reliable other then your self ? Does common sense exist anymore ?
111821	Maybe @tedlieu will cover everyone‚Äôs 9 months of back rent with snarky tweets? Perhaps @RepSwalwell will chip in? After they get the vaccine of course, can‚Äôt have these American heros getting sick
108018	@CMOH_Alberta You are no doctor. You are sociopath if you think you are not abandoning Albertans with these changes. Our greatest fight against Covid-19 is the vaccine, you say. Yet, you don't give a sh!t about those who are unable to get vaccinated. RESIGN IMMEDIATELY!
110438	Not sure why we would give even a single vaccine to anyone not in the US while millions still require one. Of course other countries would want them for their people, but Americans come first. Especially as the government keeps people locked down in various areas.
109975	@KidsPlayPhotos @RandyRRQuaid I took the vaccine and it is real it's not Saline I had a very strong immune response my temperature was 102.4 my body swore up and down I had covid again it's a little discomfort but I've had covid-19 I never wanted again
109367	They all believe that other countries have been vaccinated.  They believe the vaccine is the only way out. Unfortunately this is just more inaccurate information.#COVID19
109183	So much good news in South Dakota re COVID-19 right now. Lots of numbers still high BUT: - Lowest # of active cases in 2 months- Hospitalizations lowest they've been in 2 months- death rate slowing down- Nearly all the Pfizer vaccine we've gotten so far has been administered
110158	@KatieDaviscourt @GovInslee You definitely can take vaccines, wear masks,  stay locked up, but don't make others do the same.  Vaccines do not work!Masks do not work!Staying locked up doesn't work! Just get Covid-19. And get over with it or stay locked up forever.  Covid-19 is not going anywhere.
110889	@uvmdanz @kylegriffin1 Transverse myelitis is common enough.  It's likely that they needed to confirm a secondary viral infection as its cause - one that wasn't a coronavirus or adenovirus as related to the vaccine. My father had TM. It's devastating, but not a reason to avoid this vaccine.
108248	@themadtaer There has never been a vaccine created for a coronavirus of any type.Due to antigenic shift they become useless in a short time.All viruses are not the same
108275	@nytimes The process of vaccine research and development is very long, and there are strict international standards. There are two possibilities. The first is to appease the public. The second is that the United States has already obtained the new coronavirus strain for research long ago.
108975	This tweet nicely catches the current widespread Covid-19 mood in Germany. ‚ÄòThe current situation is calling for old jokes made in the GDR. ‚ÄúSo you can‚Äôt get any vaccine here?‚Äù‚ÄúNo, sorry, but you get no vaccine over there. Here, you get no tests.‚Äù
111551	Reminds Me of d movie #2012 ..D highest bidders n d richest get to live ...Who decide that who would get d #CovidVic vaccine?? D ones with power n d moolah of course ..It sure is gonna get dirty  in d coming months...üòë#coronavirus
112405	@IvankaTrump 4/ June 16: ‚ÄúI always say, even without it [a vaccine], it goes away.‚Äù  June 18: ‚ÄúAnd it is dying out. The numbers are starting to get very good.‚Äù Heh heh heh...250 dead now! More Trump delusions. July 1: ‚ÄúAnd I think we are going to be very good with the coronavirus.‚Äù
112665	The CDC is asking those unvaccinated for COVID-19 not to journey far from home this holiday weekend.And they will all honor this request, because  if you're too stupid to take the vaccine, of course you'll religiously observe pandemic travel restrictions.
112719	C'mon #Australia - do you really think a 3rd jab, after the first 2 failed to work, will be good for you? #AustraliaHasFallen
112631	@ajc Allow me to summarize before reading. There is a shortage so they‚Äôre opening up more vaccination centers because there is not enough vaccine to satisfy demand but they need to convince people to get it because too many people want it. Something about Choppin‚Äô.
109504	This pandemic will not be over until it‚Äôs over for everyone, everywhere. I‚Äôm calling on @Novavax to pledge their commitment to making sure the COVID-19 vaccine is distributed fairly and equitably around the world. #OneWorldProtected
112702	Olympics cancelled to comply with CoViD19 bio-security safety for whole world (air/sea travel+crowds).God has not protected even the most pure+good+religious believers/ humans from SARS so far!Until vaccine given to 80% every country/the world population - nobody is safe.
202142	Today is the 1st I will go out. Got the message to do the vaccine today, but need to reschedule in another 3 month since its just a month after detected covid19+.
108009	The only way we can get our lives back and be human again is for us all to get the vaccine-Don't listen to rumours listen to the NHS -there's no animal products or alcohol in it, there's no ingredients which suggest it causes infertility, it has been tested as it's a priority.
107748	So why I‚Äôm in @CVS 15600 old pike rd Maryland and they refuse to do walk-ins for the COVID-19 booster. They stated there is no manager in this store when I recorded the entire event
108745	Isn't this... socialized medicine? Govt will pick who gets vaccine soon. But please tell me how trump is somehow stopping communism.
111419	@SusanStJames3_ How do you think the globalists got a huge supply of miracle vaccines in short order. They money laundered through Afghanistan. Then they created a coronavirus pandemic. Our benefactors are psychopaths.
111274	Great to see that the vaccine is being rolled out! When will school staff get it though? ü§îü§îü§î #teachertwitter #vaccine #PGCE
111492	This! Hourly wage workers cannot take off work (even if legally they are supposed to be allowed to) to go get a vaccine. Too many vaccination sites are only open 9-5 M-F. Why aren‚Äôt large employers vaccinating on site? They want to be 100% ‚Äòopen‚Äô, so why?
110538	@JoeBiden you should bow down to President Trimp because Trump said they would come out with the vaccines for COVID-19 this year in 2020. You said they will not come out with it until 2021. You even announced you got the vaccine
108649	".@GeraldoRivera, You were an ass before you suggested the #coronavirus #vaccine be named the #Trump vaccine to please #DonaldTrump, &amp; you're still an ass.Nothing named ""Trump"" is entering my body!  Not now! Not ever!@WhiteHouse @NIH @CDCgov @pfizer @moderna_tx"
108263	grabe jud ka amazing sa vietnam oy, very good pandemic response and they value their scientists to the extent that they‚Äôre producing their own local vaccine. nya ang pinas tawn???
108721	"""Once a vaccine is licensed, there will still be political obstacles to getting it to where it‚Äôs needed, because each country or public health jurisdiction has to make its own decision to roll it out. There will also be issues of prioritisation ‚Äì who should get it first..."""
108567	@TuckerCarlson God already created a defense against harmful pathogens like the coronavirus. It's called the immune system: antibiodies, T killer cells, etc. The best defense is getting immune to it. That's if there's no vaccine. #TUCKER
109024	Important thread: A vaccine is not going to be a magic bullet for Covid. So how long do we remain locked down and wearing masks?
109192	"@pdevine999 @sunbugg @gerry_truthvet @fionamflanagan1 Pathogens *are* the invisible flying bugs.Forget who he is and listen to what is being said.Quote: ""The people who have had the vaccine are going to be in trouble the next time they come in contact with the Coronavirus.""The ""Coronavirus"" is fake.  He is spreading disinfo."
112321	From now on, @GavinNewsom and @NYGovCuomo will not receive any federal support. They want to independently make a decision on COVID-19 Vaccine. They can produce their own vaccine and I‚Äôm not sure what their residents will do on this case.
112453	How the #CovidVaccine is going to work if the #COVID19 is a RNA virus,That means the structure keeps changing over time and gene is mutating .Now they are saying 5/6 types of #COVID are there,then how the vaccine is going to work ???
110030	@bantamsdad @LoveMeImBrogan MERS and SARS are also Coronavirus and the research from these has vastly contributed to the speed of development of the covid vaccine, I‚Äôd argue that everyone is at risk because everyone can spread it . Just because you may not get ill, your family might
107972	@LbudisaLila Australia!? That's cool. I hope you'll get to visit them soon. I believe in vaccines. I'm struggling with letting my autistic son take it. My fear is, he gets sick either with COVID-19 or a reaction to a new (rushed) vaccine, but can't articulate it to us.
108282	@ABC Why doesn‚Äôt Gov Newsom just have CA doctors write prescriptions for the COVID-19 vaccine just like they do for housing? Problem solved!
109099	If you like your Coronavirus, you can keep your Coronavirus. The @gatesfoundation's vaccine is just like Obamacare, you have to take it to know what's in it.
110261	We don't have any vaccine for Covid-19 in India. It is expected to come next year. So how negligent UGC can be for us@PMOIndia @ugc_india @DrRPNishank@HRDMinistry@31Petitioners#StudentsInSCForJustice
112115	@ActiveMom4Life @chaneykyoto @PabloHoney2_0 @BES_Proud @BitcoinJedi101 It's too bad because my friend passed away from COVID-19 this past Monday. I don't care anymore. Get vaxxed or don't. I do not care.
108438	@kyliestanton No because they have pushed back the dates for my elderly parents and in-laws by 2 months. We are trying to keep people alive but they are living in isolation.  Canada‚Äôs ranking is dropping for administering COVID-19 vaccine.
110493	@Matthew_Hodson @RevJide Be safe... I heard what's happening in London and yes it's everyone's responsibility to take vaccine when it will be offered... As a medico i know what harsh effects Covid19 doesüòû
112050	The troubles that are ahead of us will bring down the world economy. The coronavirus is not leaving , and a vaccine is far from being approved for use...
108072	@ausgov 24/7 govt &amp; MSM BS. Coronavirus been around probably forever.Animals have coronavirus.Had a flu vaccine good chance you got coronavirus. Testing, does it test for coronavirus which is an umbrella term, or does it test for covid19? Tracking/spying vaccines=tyranny UN Agenda21/2030
107768	How's it going @PremierScottMoe? Vaccines were only one piece not the whole strategy in this war! It's no brainer that you're playing a game where rules have changed &amp; you can't keep up. This is not the old COVID19 &amp;  Delta is winning! #FailureToLead #FailureToProtect #COVID19SK
107987	Welcome news of @BharatBiotech becoming the anchor developer of coronavirus vaccine in Odisha. This is another feather in the cap of the state that has already made waves globally with the way it has dealt with this pandemic. #odishafightscorona @Naveen_Odisha @CMO_Odisha
202349	Today I was on EXIT DUTY!!

111818	2 days in a row, no covid deaths. Please consider getting the vaccine if you haven‚Äôt already. We have the science needed to beat this thing!
109226	"Take it from someone with ""the AIDS"".There is NO vaccine. HIV is a manageable illness thanks to the science this fucknut doesn't believe in, and the activists this shit stain tear gassed.So fuck this liar and everything it says."
108148	My aunt in Oklahoma drove 3 hours one way for her first COVID19 vaccine last week. My mome got her first dose in Kansas yesterday. Making progress, folks. It feels great knowing they'll be protected.
111026	"@Fr0ggers He said something like ""how come they'll find a vaccine for COVID-19 but not a cure for cancer"" HDFHYGFYSHD I hate him lmaooo"
112369	How long does the immunity last with the vaccine? Is it comparable to immunity attained from previous infection? Will this vaccine cause any long term effects? If no, how do we know for certain? #vaccination #COVID19
112584	Great news, Multnomah and other counties who have improved their risk category! While indoor dining will be allowed on a limited basis, I‚Äôm still ordering take out until more vaccines get into arms. Including my own!
110379	"@AriMelber I get the Twitter world is pissed but there's 340 million Americans who just want the proverbial ""trains to run on time"". They want Covid-19 relief checks, they want vaccine shipments! Colorado needs the unemployment system fixed! They need government to function!"
110645	No good having a #COVID19 vaccine if you're living in a community with little to no needles, syringes, health care workers, hospitals. FIX THE SYSTEM so we can all enjoy a safe and healthy future!
111699	GET GOOGLE CHROME, SEARCH THE PICTURE IN ALL SIZES. IF YOU SEE IT LISTED IN WISH, ALIEXPRESS, ALIBABA OR ANY OTHER SITE THAT SELLS CHINESE GARBAGE THEN DO NOT BUY IT. STOP MAKING THE KILLERS OF COVID19 MONEY SINCE THEY REFUSE TO PAY FOR VACCINES OF THE PANDEMIC THEY CREATED!
107800	Anyone else think @POTUS just needs to put @WaltDisneyWorld @Disney in charge of administering #COVID19 vaccine? Done in a month. Americans would gladly give them tons of $$$$ to stand in fun lines while kids pleaded to come back next year with their grandparents!
110165	"""Brilliant! Translation: *Secret WHO lab* """"We have the coronavirus vaccine, but we still need to refine it because it doesn't yet cause autism"""""""

108766	"All this effort going into risk getting the variant, not surviving, then a fake narrative of them being ""vaxxed"" and still dying."
109547	@HimymCraig @MrJonCryer ‚ÄúI hope everyone remembers when they‚Äôre getting the Covid-19 (often referred to as the Trump Virus) vaccine, that if I‚Äôd been a competent President, you wouldn‚Äôt be getting that beautiful shot at all because there‚Äôd be no need to do so, like when Pres. Obama took care of Ebola.‚Äù
108830	They are part of problem not the solution. It isn't even a virus, so why would a vaccine work? After 4 or 5 boosters there is no healing or protection from it. However,   with small pox or measles vaccines, you dont get it. People are gullible!
108133	@amyklobuchar @GovEvers @SenatorBaldwin If people have to present a covid-19 vaccine card surely they are smart enough to get a voter ID. Stop with this nonsense voter ID is the only way.
111022	@PatSights That's good. I know there are lots of people out there working very hard to find a vaccine for the Coronavirus and I have faith in those scientists. To be honest, I don't really even know what a vaccine is or how it works so I'm helping them by staying home üòâ
111799	Low efficacy. High price. Why? You can't say no to China??? Always China priority??? . Maawa Naman kayo sa mga Pilipino please. Give the best instead of settling for something less just because you want to please Chinaüò° @SecDuque #NoToChinaMadeVaccine üò°
107881	@AsTheWorldBurnz @jen_myPsalms182 Yeah, just a guess. It would certainly be weird if they had a COVID-19 vaccine

110898	COVID-19 treatments and medicine have improved so much in the recent months thanks to the tireless work pf the Trump admin and so many scientists working on cures and vaccinesSoon it will be no scare and fright any longerWe will learn to live with this virus as with the flu
112501	Eti how do you know I was going to get the virus before you give me the vaccine?üò†üò†üò†So when you are being given polio,BcG or Hep B vaccine to you its for cure not protection?
111775	Dr. Bonnie Henry explains why the #COVID19 vaccine isn't recommended for people who are immunocompromised. It's because the treatments they are undergoing lower their immune system and may not respond well to certain vaccines.... 1/2
107741	"The industry has been working on Coronavirus vaccines for much longer than this year.  It is no miracle.  It has nothing to do with you whatsoever. However, as you know, certain people with hidden investments have done a ""great job"" ensuring the pandemic spreads this year..."
202356	@MattHancock @bt_uk @BorisJohnson @NHS @10DowningStreet you never had any intention of vaccinating the under 50s. It was just a ploy to keep us locked up. liars.

110159	I like the growing narrative that a Russian coronavirus vaccine will be released, but it's unsafe due to it being hurried through testing.

110897	@opinionated75 @Jenzen789 @anthvera24 I've lost 5 friends and 3 family members after taking the vaccine. My daughter was in jail and forced to take the vaccine she is fully vaccinated and now sick as hell with covid19. Wake up the virus is in the vaccine.
108042	Fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and the best part so far is that the pro-disease crowd is still vocal but now they're mad because they've been told they're going to be banned from having a fun summer. No vax, no job, no jab, no fun. #vaccinate

109126	@Liv3_Chris @duncansykes @carolecadwalla I accept that but the problem isn‚Äôt catching a coronavirus, virtually everyone in the world has had a coronavirus. It‚Äôs catching this coronavirus and being hospitalised and then breaching the health system‚Äôs capacity. The vaccine hopefully stops that.
110623	we dont know how long the vaccine will protect us either. Hell they already saying we need more shots......
107757	@TChivese @RangaMberi We need to understand why countries are investing so much on Covid-19 vaccines; to create herd immunity as fast as is possible and stop the virus from mutating into extremely transmissible variants. If goal is herd immunity, then mandatory vaccination of everyone is justifiable!
111595	The Coronavirus vaccine will most probably require very low temperature storage. Do we have such storage equipments across governorates in Egypt?
108367	The whole house can then stand shoulder to shoulder, with their families, and line up for those vaccines... not saline in a syringe... the same toxic shit they want us to line up for... you first guys. Then I‚Äôll wait 5yrs n see how you‚Äôre doing...
111362	I shall beg my family for news now. I would wish that my country could get this vaccine easily but we're running low on budget...
108624	I just pray we have enough vaccines, don't care what company has made them if they are approved, not only for all of our citizens and others that live in this wonderful country but also for the whole world. Covid-19 is a very deadly disease and we all need a chance to fight it.
111237	love all of yalls coronavirus takes. keep em comin. love hearing about lockdowns being good and the vaccines being bad or whatever. good stuff and very informative :)
111781	If everyone who wants to get the vaccine does do, what does it matter?That‚Äôs the risk those who don‚Äôt take the vaccine signed up for.
111582	@CPInst @MarkMeadows They first must define whether it is an actual vaccine‚Ä¶ which it is not.  #COVID19   Then they must show the proof that they harm the recipient‚Ä¶ that spike is deadly.  Next bring out the therapeutics.   Delta is not Wuhan.
109653	@briebriejoy @SS6XX The USA essentially subsidizes all medication research is part of the reason for our outrageous costs. I‚Äôm not saying it is all warranted, but there‚Äôs a reason the first Covid-19 vaccines being rolled out are American.
108165	@jkwan_md @Billius27 @Kidsdoc1Rick i'm sorry, didn't i hear expert after expert declare the vaccines would be equally effective for any variants? [we need new flu vaccines every year, right?] not doubting we can get there but a one-time one-vaccine approach probably not the best
112729	I think that is the UK govt's. plot.Keep 'fear' going by enforcing the wearing of masks even though the virus has weakened.Then rush out a vaccine - not adequately tested and likely to be inneffective.#NoMask #HydroxycloroquineWorks

111937	Mark Meadows is saying that Covid-19 can't be contained. No masks and social distancing needed. Trump is banking on a vaccine that his idiots will not get. Experts say that if only 50% of the population gets the vaccine it will not eradicate Covid-19 and it will be @ for years.
108718	Has anyone heard any word yet? Apprantley easterhouse is one of the communities and I‚Äôm an unpaid carer for my mum and tried for a vaccine last week and was told there was no spaces and wasn‚Äôt on any list coming up?
111471	@Morgan_Falk @GYamey Actually - I don‚Äôt think you do. The vaccines are based off of the spike protein from this coronavirus. This means that if you had a bad reaction to the vaccine - your reaction to getting covid could be far worse - best

109229	@cbn2 @oranaise @NewYorkMeteoro1 @samhusseini @Athbheochan @KellyRek @Salon That's why it works on the cold virus which is by the way I Coronavirus. The best way to establish herd immunity is not to use the vaccine but use the substance is already available which are actually more effective and just go through the process of getting mildly ill if at all
108507	@VaccineFinder Guy, the annual coronavirus IS a natural vaccine they are trying to replace with who knows what. Nobody is liable for damages BUT the people. So, to keep liability to a MINIMUM.......DON'T take the vaccine.
112503	My daughter asked ‚Äúso what if @WHO finds a vaccine fir #COVID19 . ‚Äú Do we not take it or get it since 45 pulled out ? How sad that kids have stuff like this on their minds . #VOTEHIMOUT
109355	@WillowWyse @DavisonPhill @RichardDawkins You want EVERYONE to take a vaccine that doesn't exist. To be against a Bill Gates (not a doctor) covid19 vaccine doesn't make anyone anti vaxx.March, the WHO said no masks for the public. Now they want us to wear masks. Now, take a vaccine. They don't know what they're doing.
109467	So...  Herd immunity for Covid-19, is believed?  But vaccines that actually foster herd immunity are bad?  So, herd immunity is junk until something like Covid-19 comes along...  Also, vaccines do not cause autism. Fuck off.  There is no herd immunity to Covid-19. Just stop.
108978	@DrKellyVictory What about the fact that coronavirus vaccines have been so startlingly unsuccessful in the past? Why would this be any different? Not challenging you, just wondering.

111810	@jimcollinson If the incidence of #Covid19 is 10x lower in the population you would need 10x more recruits- far more expensive. What is the motive? Zero covid countries are not good for community vaccine trials. So is there pressure on Government not to follow a zero covid strategy
112287	@RiyanVirtanen @RBReich False virtue in being a martyr?  You do realize you might die of Covid-19 before every minority on the planet is vaccinated, don't you.  Seems like a waste of a life just to own the white race.  Wouldn't it be better to get vaccinated, and then advocate getting everyone vaxxed?
110134	@CDCgov if you already had the COVID vaccine, how will the flu vaccine affect our immune system, given the flu vaccine contains Coronavirus proteins from the chicken eggs?  Will our bodies severely over-react?
110976	When the press just make stuff up and think we're are dumb.@NewshubNZ  you don't have enough evidence either way.  On the same level - Covid vaccine will not give you cancer. I can't prove that, nobody can prove the opposite. We still don't have enough data. #misinformation
112039	@tomhfh It can take up to 30 years to iron all the bugs out of vaccines (as it did with Smallpox).I am willing to let others become guinea pigs to do this with #Covid19 vaccine.Any deaths or long term damage/illness just adds fuel to the fire for the anti-vax brigade.
110070	@ewarren Fighting the Coronavirus is going to be like fighting the Flu. A vaccine needs to be developed it‚Äôs going to take time and money and less panic
112922	@ThePatriotDavid @ImperialWick Fauci invested in Chinese companies no doubt because he's friends with Gates. Everything they're doing is for AI and Coronavirus is a way to give us vaccine which doesn't help shit! The vaccine is for microchipping us. These assholes are ominous and their goal nefarious
110200	The truth will out in the end. Hopefully, before they extend the coronavirus bill and roll out the vaccine! Keep speaking truth! Write to your MP!
107756	@TeamMaga45 Information that they leave out, it is no different than the flu vaccine. Just because you get the vaccine does not guarantee you won't get Coronavirus. Important information they leave out, 80% of the people hospitalized with covid-19 are morbidly obese.#EatRightExercise
108599	@ant1fababe @Toastysmom No no no. You‚Äôre talking about the effect on others. I‚Äôm talking about a person getting the vaccine and it‚Äôs efficacy once they come into contact with the virus again.

111031	@Gidi_Traffic @KunleOre Just like every other medication and vaccines, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 Vaccine that is being administered in Nigeria expires today. Nobody is hoarding any Vaccine. Hope this helps.
109438	Why do business journalists talk abt clinical trials when they don‚Äôt understand.I also don‚Äôt but know this it take years for vaccine to come out. We will be very luck if any reliable COVID vaccine comes by oct or Nov 2021. Unless govt‚Äôs just rush it through.  #COVID19
112019	.@JoeBiden @VP @KamalaHarris @SenatorWarnock @SenOssoff @ossoff @RaphaelWarnock @DrFouchi an answer from any of you would be appreciated. Nobody rushed to get us a vaccine then and yet if we lived through it, we still get no easy access to this one now. #COVID19 #VaccineEquity

201852	No worries, I did my research and it is a great vaccine and I intend on getting it as soon as my time comes. The alternative is being a long hauler and death. I choose life. #CovidVaccine
112109	@HuangLili777 @AnthonyClaughan You‚Äôre ignoring the point again. Polio &amp; smallpox ravaged populations because we didn‚Äôt have a vaccine so herd immunity will not preserve life. Our old &amp; vulnerable will pay the ultimate price for this strategyCOVID-19 is more contagious &amp; has no vaccine. Not comparable to flu.
108585	The bar has been set #ROC! Just vaccinated a person who ran the race then came to get their vaccine. It‚Äôs just that easy to get the Covid19 vaccine.
108073	@fishluvr1 @GavinNewsom Corona virus is transmitted more easily and attacks more severely than flu. Also, there is no vaccine for coronavirus like there is for various strains of flu each year. So, they really aren‚Äôt comparable.
112708	I want someone, Anyone to explain to me how a mayor has the power to do this. No vaccine. No business. New laws because I say so. @NYGovCuomo u woulda looked like a Champ removing those moron but he must have something on U. That‚Äôs y his wife lost 850 million &amp; u say nothing.
107814	"Mark Meadows has made it very clear that the only ""strategy"" they have for COVID-19 is to pray for a vaccine. They've given up trying to contain or mitigate the virus. This is made clear through the actions of Trump and Pence. They don't give a shit about you."

111644	@truly_wild Yh that‚Äôs normal for most vaccines, they usually take over a year to make, however I meant that there‚Äôs no hope in a vaccine if our body doesn‚Äôt create antibodies against covid19 lmao bc that‚Äôs exactly what a vaccine is
202286	MORE: This means, if you‚Äôve not received your first dose of the #COVID19 #vaccine, and you have tix to the Sept. 26 game against the WFT, you cannot attend.
110728	I've been waiting for this day since March 2020. Having my entire family get sick with the virus was scarier than I imagined it would be, and the vaccine for the kids helps to ensure that we can avoid it happening again.
110603	But it‚Äôs not pointing a gun in someone‚Äôs face to put a gun I their face and make them take medicine?Also, please learn science. If you‚Äôre vaxxed, they aren‚Äôt a threat to you.
109558	6/ If effective vaccines *don't* roll out within the next 12 months, then countries will get fierce about +/- COVID_19 status; the divide will become very rigid. Don't kid yourself that everyone will be in the same boat; they're not and they won't be.https://t.co/1fXVcis22u
111713	@LisaMarieBoothe I think he plans to make bank on vaccines and he does not have good intentions.Why would he send money to China to create a genetically modified strain of coronavirus (which infected the world) when our country put a stop to it? He predicted it - and he made it happen. #Evil

111213	@JohnTitor33621 @realDonaldTrump OMG this is awful! Never wanted a coronavirus vaccine. Nothing from Fauci/Gates
109931	How odd that China and other countries didn't require a filthy vaccine for the virus to go away.  Why does the U.S?  Oh, that's right, we are the only country that CANNOT sue them for any death or injury as they are ALL for profit! Got it!
109802	This is what we call a progressive move. And a progressive initiative. Mana ada PN jaga rakyat? Mana? @Khairykj pun kata menurut artikel berita vaccine percuma untuk 7 juta orang. How about the rest? This is why @pakatanharapan_ is better for the people. @rajiv4malaysia Thanks
201968	Lucknow: At least 28,331 people took the jab against Covid-19 in Lucknow on Wednesday. While 22,540 people took the second dose, 5,791 got the first. Among those vaccinated with first or second shots, 56% were men and 44% women.
109930	I got vaccinated to protect my patients, my coworkers, husband, my family, my friends and myself. Vaccines work. But they work best when we all get them. #VaccinesWork #igottheshot #COVID19
109348	They only care bout the money , you get the vaccine they get paid, you dont get it they fine you or jail you and they still getting paid
112804	so, if its autumn before 'everyone' (who wants it) in all the groups is vaccinated, and the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission.. are we staying in this limbo life until autumn?
108459	If you‚Äôre playing antivaxxer bingo:*vaccine is about control*no one has died from COVID-19*my friend had the vaccine and is now very poorly*perhaps alcohol mixes with the vaccine and makes it worse*government is trying to suppress our immune systems*masks are bad for you

110848	@carry_studios @TakethatCt @robinmonotti @InCytometry Only some viruses. And only in retroviruses can this reverse transcribe and insert into our DNA. Coronavirus clearly does not have this capability and the vaccine certainly doesn't
202237	Got my Covid-19 booster at Walmart. Them proceeded to spend too much money because I was shopping hungry and without a list. üòêMy super powers have yet to reveal themselves.
108237	This is the thing I want to scream in the faces of everybody going on about opening up the lock down or letting a certain segment of the population out: You do not actually have any control over how this thing develops, till there is a viable vaccine.

110506	His tweet mocking the vaccine went viral with anti-vaxxers, then he died because he didn't get the vaccine. That should be an example to anti-vaxxers, and everyone not getting the vaccine honestly.
111058	We won‚Äôt be taking evil Gates vaccine. Not met one person who will take this, not one and trust me I ask everyone wherever I go.
110445	A reminder that it's very likely multiple promising COVID-19 vaccine candidates will not succeed. But also thisüëáis good news to see even with trials moving so quickly protocols working. Pauses are normal, this is scientists working to keep us safe.

110077	@FreeLancerInc @MichelV69 @subvoyeur First, there is nothing new about this vaccine.

109738	Before this covid-19 virus is over if it ever is we will see one million plus deaths in our country! We don't know enough about the vaccines ! How long will they last? Will they work against these new strains of coronavirus? We still have a lot to learn and deaths to come!

110518	Great news. Is this a mutated strain, or just a different one, or is it near its end of life? There is no guarantee that there isn't stronger one lurking out there. How can a vaccine be developed if there are different versions floating out there.

108514	@peszeke There is no biological imperative for the virus to only mutate to milder strains. As long as humans do such a good job of passing this thing around, coronavirus doesn‚Äôt have to worry about keeping its hosts upright. That‚Äôs why NPI are just as urgent as vaccines right now.

110176	So, I am 24 hours from my first dose of @moderna_tx #CovidVaccine. The hope and gratitude from being in that room still remains.  My only symptom is a sore arm. @OSUWexMed @osu_pharmacy #TwitteRx #PharmRes
109401	@POTUS COVID-19 vaccine is! I know where the universal vaccine is! I know how to make any human disease free! How to let the human any disease does not have the method! As long as the method is correct! Anything can happen!! Hope for all mankind!! Believe that miracles can happen
111858	I'm curious to if a type 1 diabetic, with hypothyroidism, who is allergic to sulfa and NSAIDS,in their 30's, can receive the coronavirus vaccine or not?
107957	If you went to Exit in the 90s while you were underage then do not worry about what‚Äôs in the coronavirus vaccine
111847	@MarissaNovetsky No... As coronavirus is the common cold and is always mutating, there is no way anyone can develop a vaccine for it!
111819	OMG, what cry-babies.  What a flimsy excuse this is.  No one will be so sick from the vaccine that he/she can't go to work.  Stop finding excuses not to get the vaccine and/or not to go to work.
107965	@SenTedCruz @CBS11 More COVID-19 Vaccine needed in California, too. Only those needing the 2nd dose will get it. Getting scheduled for an appointment has been sketchy.
108206	Scientists have identified an ‚Äúescape mutant‚Äù that may decrease the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines.The mutation -- called E484K -- has been found in a variant of the coronavirus first spotted in South Africa two months ago. That variant has now spread to 12 other countries.

109417	@610CKTB ‚ÄúDoctors are worried that coronavirus may end up being like influenza, which requires a new vaccine every year both because the circulating strains mutate fast and because immunity from the vaccine wears off quickly.‚Äù

202115	I got the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday. Other than my arm being sore as hell and some fatigue, I feel great. Sharing here just in case someone is on the fence about getting it (which is completely reasonable) and has questions.

110349	wait 4 years before they can go back to work and it's much more likely that people will develop the antibodies that will protect them from this Coronavirus long before a vaccine comes to market even if they do it in 18 months or less.
201916	My mother received her first Covid-19 vaccination shot today. It was the Moderna vaccine. She was speaking in tongues and hissing like a gargoyle afterwards. but is otherwise fine.
109577	Have I missed the part where they isolated the virus to begin with? I‚Äôm curious to understand how a vaccine could be created without isolating the virus first. Or is that not even necessary? If anyone understands this, please let us know.
110605	Why? 1 person who is jabbed has caught covid and has mild symptoms.Explain how that justifies a pause.
108618	@nypost Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
112058	So you can publish the data on the isolated genome that is the root cause then?If you can do that then you don't need any man made jab but an actual vaccine containing dead cells...or don't you have any???
108181	@PeterKolchinsky @CityJournal If you're a virologist, then please discuss ADE as it pertains to coronavirus, and what the implications are for success in making a vaccine for this virus.Noting that infection with coronavirus does not convey long-term immunity, of course...
110807	For those on my TLFor those who are in the UK, take the oxford vaccine, asap For those who have already had the vaccine, remember to have 2nd inoculation.But importantly still social distance and take precautions once you have had the vaccine.#covid19
110801	@fact_covid  This is great news but once the #Coronavirus vaccine starts being rolled out, how will we prove we've had it and therefore safe to travel? Will it be like Yellow Fever where you get a certificate of vaccination?
112233	I have been waiting for months in Australia for my #covid19 vaccine while my American friend has already been fully vaccinated its really fucking infuriating being in the dark about what's going on and when I heard I am going to have to wait until September for the Pfizer vaccine

112533	@glassforsenate False.  This is merely a statement from an outside organization, NOT a bill.  There is NO evidence that the state has any plans to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory.
109204	This astonishes me. I have young freinds who have had Covid, even donating antibodies- there is no way they need a vaccine.
111067	@joh_public @DangerousGlobe @ChrisWickNews @trixasis2 Brother.We have no cure for coronavirus. Not the common cold, not SARS MERS or influenza.This vaccine does not cure or eradicate a virus.For that reason alone, lockdowns, mandatory vax, is merely impeding on human rights.This isn't POLIO, a non mutagenic virus.
108521	Congress Has To Change Their President... Bs... If This Is Done... Then For Sure Congress Will Be Back In Its Full From... But Rahul And Sonia Jii Has To Understand This Point... @INCIndia @RahulGandhi #Sachin_pilot #RajasthanPolitics #Rajasthan #BJP #coronavaccine #coronavirus
107930	@IrenaArts No one is forced to take a vaccine. The numbers willing to accept the Covid-19 vaccines are probably high enough to achieve herd immunity so the population will be safe. The issue then is focusing on making individuals safe. If you accept the vaccine, you make yourself safe.
110868	I'll be with you Bernie! I don't even have the bloody stupid app on my phone and that's how it's going to stay. Even if they issued a paper form of proof, it would go in the shredder.#NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere
108519	"if the ""vaccines"" work then why to those with them worry about those who don't get the jab?  The vaccinated still get and spread covid-19 &amp; it is proven they actually carry a higher viral load then those who don't get the jab. somebody explain this to me please."
109169	@KO_Officer @birdbraininves1 @frankmentalizm @mcuban There has never been an instance of vaccine effects after 2 months, in history, with any vaccine.This coronavirus is new, and has killed over 700,000 people.  But you stick with that narrative you're so married to.
202178	Both kids received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine!Science Rules!!!#CovidVaccine #vaccinated https://t.co/Is1e1YrP2J
111516	Had my kids do a Cause and Effect assignment about COVID-19 and it‚Äôs amazing to see the types of answers I‚Äôm getting. They all want a vaccine. They‚Äôre all staying home. They all say they miss school but they‚Äôre happy to be home.‚Ä¶Can my class run the country? Or state? Please?
112651	This is the face of fascism, I guarantee that once vaccines come out, people will have show proof they took it to move around.
112930	Intel drop. ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏èMakes total sense. [They] would never release a bioweapon unless they had the antidote (vaccine) for themselves. Of course the vaccine [they] have planned for us is Not the same one [they] take.#CoronaVirus #CoronavirusPandemic #GatesForPrison2020

109528	If restaurants want to keep their patrons coming back all year long, they need to start requiring proof of vaccine for indoor dining.

112834	I got my first dose of the Covid Vaccine üíâ. And I feel ok ( It depends on the days). I want to be able to see my grandparents and my high risk friends. Plz get the vaccine!! #GetVaccinated #COVID19
112062	There will never be a vaccine for Covid-19 because flu virus mutate just like other flu viruses #CoronaBollocks  #gmb
202101	Covid coming to an immune system near youI was vaccinated and contracted the virus. Felt sick for about 36 hours, also my father who is vaccinated also caught the virus. He too was fine within two days.Vaccine made the sickness minimal but everyone's gonna get itStay safe
110549	I hate that he gets a vaccine before so many who need it but...this is necessary. Can't overstate the impact on voters, especially skeptics, who need to see elected officials taking the vaccine.

109572	@nate0902 @PaulOCo94834963 @DirtyWater1242 @CodeRed6789 @JoeBiden Likewise I‚Äôve been vaccinated for influenza and COVID-19 and I‚Äôve had both of them in my lifetime. Why? I would have to assume, the vaccine didn‚Äôt work. With COVID my symptoms were mild but so were the unvaxed thanks to Omicron. The flu not so mild.
202430	Very happy that my mother and grandmother are now eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. Now how do I get them to take it? üßê
112942	Don't care which political party you support. But these innocent people just want to get a vaccine shot. They are suffering. No one talks about them. They traveled and got nothing. Everything is politics, even human lives.
108332	@Craig_A_Spencer I do think that once the vaccine has reached a majority of the population, Covid-19 will be comparable to influenza in terms of lethality, but that‚Äôs still a long way off. I‚Äôm qualified for a schedule 1a vaccine, but NYC is so understocked, it‚Äôll take months for my inoculation.
202089	@Politics_PR Question, does getting the vaccine stop people from being able to spread Covid-19?  My vaccinated daughter-in-law has Covid-19 right now along with my son &amp; grandbaby so if I come in contact with my daughter-in-law can she spread it to me since she's vaccinated?
112215	The pandemic is not over. I've received one does of the Moderna vaccine, going for my second in two weeks. Mask up, keep it up, because this is happening in Canada and it can very easily happen here, if it hasn't already started.
111137	There was an israelie study in September/October that showed booster immunity wanes after just 12 days. There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine and this one is no different.
108668	So does this mean I am extra protected with natural immunity and the vaccine? Hope so. Really don‚Äôt want to experience it again üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
110272	@10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson @BBCNews my son has a very high phobia of needles and wants the vaccine but won‚Äôt have a needle, how do we sort it out #COVID19
111745	@Jimcorrsays is exactly right here.The flu shot is a campaign to incite COVID symptoms, further perpetuate the lockdowns, continue the public fear, &amp; then offer their solution.Their vaccine.The question is why, why is it important to get the covid vaccine...
112620	Bro I‚Äôm out here reading the vaccine module that they give you and shit says ‚ÄúThe vaccine is an unapproved vaccine that may prevent Covid-19 and it‚Äôs not FDA approved‚Äù üòê Why are we getting this shit then

109369	@RatatoskrUK @joncoopertweets I guess  I've got no reason  to be angry  either huh. My perfectly  healthy  daughter  bought into the fear that's been pushed and took the vax. Now she has serious liver issues  and is borderline  liver failure.  Why? COVID-19 Vaccine  Injury.  A life if misery awaits her.
111445	@Reuters If they can develop vaccines for COVID-19 this fast, there is no excuse anymore as to why there are not vaccines for other diseases!
108276	The same #Pfizer who have in the past paid out milllions &amp; millions in law suits for #Vaccine damage ? This #vaccine is an an experiment it has not been passed as safe until 2023.   We are the guinea pigs &amp; No Child should be exposed to this !!!!
111096	Just Say No For The COVID-19 Vaccine.Everyone Will Get Sick Regardless If You're Vaccinated Or Not, And Symptoms Will Not Be Any Worse If You're Not Vaccinated.
112051	Now they are going after The Navy Seals over the Covid-19 vaccine. When are they gonna stop. I want to know who‚Äôs making these decisions Hunter   Because who ever it is they‚Äôve got to be high
112855	If there was a vaccine for this coronavirus all this economic impact could be avoided. But you see vaccines are not money makers so they are not funded well.
111938	Trumpets are really stupid. Instead of getting a free vaccine plus a vaccine card these idiots got no vaccine and paid $200 for a fake card.
110892	@GovernorTomWolf Don't do it one covid-19 was just made up so you dummies out there who are still wearing masks could think that Trump was bad yes it's true the vaccine is to control you and it is also too poison you down the road I will not get the vaccine
108836	How many have seen tweets &amp; heard people say with swagger and resolve - I'm not getting a #Covid19 vaccine?Reminds me of the kid in school who boasts that they're not going to study for the test.......Why do they need to broadcast those messages?

112696	Does Twitter even post people who make the remarks about the covid-19 if you're against the vaccine I think they can't kick it off I don't even think they would if you'd believe it talk about it if you're not pro-vaccination they don't even let your comments go on

112895	@realDonaldTrump Not even close to accurate. The stock market is not the economy. There are still millions out of work and the Coronavirus is still a Pandemic. There is no vaccine and your political stunts won‚Äôt prove a vaccine‚Äôs efficacy.
112034	Now I don‚Äôt work in branding/marketing as such, but Lordy: ‚ÄòPfizer‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine will now be known as ‚ÄúComirnaty,‚Äù Health Canada wrote. Moderna‚Äôs, meanwhile, has been dubbed ‚ÄúSpikevax‚Äù and AstraZeneca‚Äôs will be called ‚ÄúVaxzevria.‚Äù‚Äô
110571	So, during the interval between the 2 shots for the vaccine - they‚Äôre advising to avoid consuming any alcohol until our immune system accepts &amp; gets used to itYeah...it‚Äôs going to be lockdown level 5 all over again if that‚Äôs the vaccine route in South Africa üò≠üòÇ
111695	Got my first dose of Coronavirus COVID-19 Moderna vaccine. My arm is sore, I feel kind of dizzy or like I've been in ocean too long. Still no big deal. I think the virus is a joke but whatever, if it makes it easier on me and people will leave me alone, I'll get the vaccination.
110129	Worth watching this 1 min video if you think that you will not be getting the Covid-19 vaccine.The question is why Gates does this. It isn‚Äôt for money. He is an ideologue and truly believes that he is doing something positive for the world: he also wants to reduce population
112769	@___decipher___ @metamacky @savanna_jeffrey @BBCNews There is too much uncertainty surrounding this vaccine so I'm in no rush to take it. Need to take a step back and analyse before making the decision to take it or not. Coronavirus also doesn't seem as serious and deadly as previously thought either.
110598	Ignorance is going to be the end of human existence. You want any sense of normal back in our lives, get the vaccine.
109489	@rath_erin @chipcoffey *Diseases.  So what you're implying is that everyone that gets sick should just hope for the best that they don't end up dead instead of doing what they can to get better?  No wonder the US is where it is with COVID-19 with that thinking.  Vaccines Work.
112754	The Modi government refused to do adequate pandemic planning--they had a year to do this.Misinformation has hurt people, too.Now, the need is supported shelter in place with food aid&amp; free vaccines for all. Although, vax weren't ordered, either.#COVIDSecondWave
112709	Wait just a minute, they put laxatives in the #mRNA #CovidVaccines, seriously look it up, they put miralax in the shot, why?! So when #COVID19 enters our system we can poop it out?! #headscratcher

112663	I have had 2 letters, 3 texts, 3 phone calls asking if I want the MRNA vaccine.  I've been consistent with my answer ie NO.  I've had confirmed Covid-19 and know what to expect if I get it again, thank you!  If this isn't Government Coercion then I don't know what is.

108008	Important. People can still harbour virus in their nose &amp; throat, so immunity doesn‚Äôt mean you cannot pass it on. May be an issue with vaccines. Only way to get out of that dilemma is Whole population vaccination with high uptake esp in vulnerable categories

111315	Anti-vaxxers that say Bill Gates wants to use the vaccine to control world population will say it implanted something else.
109451	@DeAnna4Congress Must be for COVID-19, not COVID-20, because viruses don't mutate anymore, they just stay COVID-19 until a 'vaccine' is provided. ü§î
111054	Truth is, everyone is rushing out to catch #COVID19 again. Those queing, those unaware they're asymptomatic. Yep well done @BorisJohnson the least you could've done is made sure everyone had been given their first dose of the vaccine. Herd immunity continuation.
110887	Unfortunately people who are skeptical are still going to stay skeptical.  They will cling on to the other conspiracy theories as justification to not get it. They still are ignorant about how vaccines works.
109193	My 92 year-old Mum-in-law will be among the first ever to get the coronavirus vaccine as a care home resident in the UK. But feels too entitled. She wants young people should get it first. #COVID19Vaccine

109795	I reviewed your article and find it is fundamentally flawed; i.e. there will never be a vaccine. There is no vaccine for any of the coronavirus as a class, including SARS, MERS, the Asian flu of 1957 or the Spanish flu of 1918. Basing financial decisions on bad science is dumb
108974	@realDonaldTrump We don‚Äôt need an experimental vaccine for the Common Cold virus a Coronavirus. The media is preying on people‚Äôs ignorance by calling it a ‚ÄúNovel Coronavirus.‚Äù FYI: If vaccines are so safe, why aren‚Äôt vaccine manufacturers liable for vaccine injuries?
201845	This is so great. I'm going to have all my vaccine information tattooed on my body in case I lose my card--but where?
108918	@LiesTbe @WendyBellPgh Polio also isn't completely eradicated globally either. Neither is the flu. Smallpox is the only disease completely prevented from vaccines.  The reason vaccines exist is to get to herd immunity without massive death. The flu and coronavirus are two completely different viruses

110391	"My concern is that, since there are multiple strain already, is one vaccine gonna work for all of them? Or do we need multiple vaccination? Or worse come to worse, we just need to ""live"" with COVID-19, i.e., adapt the new normal."

110601	Good morning - As you may have heard, the first batch of the COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Los Angeles last night. This moment is a testament to the work of the scientists who made this possible, and to all those working logistics to get this vaccine to our frontline workers.
111480	I‚Äôm not taking it. They can have my dose.I suggest the look into planned parenthood‚Äôs Margaret Sanger, Bill Gates Sr., Bill Gates before they take a vaccine. Personally I don‚Äôt want to play God.Some powerful people involved in vaccines, in their own words, do want to play God.
112914	No ifs about it,  Would you take a punt on vaccine for a coronavirus that has been rushed through? The Molotov cocktail will be ready to go!!! Just the production to sort.Bill Gates is on record stating he wants population reduction. who does he think he is God?  @kbf
108408	@OilersSpoilers @J_TheCynic Coronavirus is just a flu that‚Äôs a fact! Covid is different. Look it up. Fear of getting covid when you‚Äôve got coronavirus is the concern. Vaccines aren‚Äôt coming anytime soon. They never even made one for COVID SARS
109792	West Point is in my community. I am already taking every precaution I possibly can, but this decision made more places unsafe for longer. I can't go back to my therapist's office until there's a vaccine.
111217	It's gonna get real ugly soon.  We will not be taking a vaccine for a virus with an extremely high recovery rate and effective treatments.
111807	@NHSEngland I'd like to sign up for under 18 covid19 vaccine trials in North of England please can you give me info. I've raised over ¬£2,000 with my painted pebbles for the NHS, am still going but also doing an outreach for the air ambulance having collected over 15,000 stamps.
109080	The thing about anti vaxxers. They only hurt themselves and other antivaxxers, that is if the vaccine is effective. If, like the Flu Vaccines that have an efficacy rate of somewhere between 19 and 39% depending on the year, then even with the vaccine you can get COVID-19.
108105	Should it be mandatory for healthcare workers to get the COVID-19 vaccine? What if they say no? We debate!
110647	If the vaccine is deadly, why start the healthcare workers when they are the most needed resource? #healthcare #vaccine #COVID19 #CyrilRamaphosa #FamilyMeeting
201975	Alhamdullah received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine today! I am ready to finally find some normalcy in a year that has been filled with uncertainty and chaos. üôè
108317	When are people going to wake up and realise that this isn't about a deadly virus, it's about global control of the population. The vaccine itself is experimental (a trial) and we're the guinea-pigs. Bill Gates (Psychopath/Eugenicist) wants to cull the global population. Wake up.
108174	"Totally serious question...Hypothetically, if 100% of the world got the COVID-19 injection, would the virus be eradicated?(As I understand it, the virus would just mutate seeing as the ""vaccines"" do not stop transmission. Am I wrong in my understanding?)"
109697	PRO: Thanks to the coronavirus vaccine, it‚Äôll be safe for me to go back to the gym starting Wednesday. üëçCON: Thanks to the coronavirus vaccine, starting Wednesday I‚Äôll need a new excuse to skip the gym. üòï
110239	#TrumpFlu is spreading faster than Coronavirus. The only vaccine is learning empathy for humans and educating yourself.
111811	@OneTrueShaun @AOC How would Medicare for all have prevented the Coronavirus pandemic or speeded up the vaccine process?
111355	@beyerstein my prediction is that the road to a safe effective coronavirus vaccine is bumpy and the bumps in the road provide grist for the antivaxxers
202405	@FTalleen @kgopinion My mother was born in the 3rd year of the Coronavirus pandemic called (falsely) Spanish Flu. She was 7 months old when her 24 yr old mother died of it.I am very grateful a vaccine has already appeared in the 1st yr of covid 19.It makes me patient for Aug
110079	@GovAndyBeshear  @StevenStackMD  it the flu vaccine has not cured the flu then there is no vaccine that will cure c19.  Locking down will just kill us all.
109511	"Crazy how much trust people put in vaccines without knowing how they work, let alone how their own immune systems work.  But keep posting your vaccine card on social media like the ""good"" citizen you are.  #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS"
111324	"Multiple studies now reporting #coronavirus antibodies fading fast.If antibodies diminish then there is a good chance the immunity from a vaccine would wane too.Could put a ""nail in the coffin"" in the idea that herd immunity to the coronavirus is attainable.#COVID19India"
109941	If a vaccine is required for admittance to states/countries i need to travel to, or to attend events like concerts, then yes I'll get vaccinated. Otherwise no.
201814	Yesterday, it was nice to have a safe visit with my parents after being vaccinated. Go get vaccinated asap! There is no excuse not to, as the COVID-19 vaccine is readily available. I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot &amp; went to work the same day. No side effects. Science works!
110017	@EvaRuth @linlewi1 @RobertTGarrett @travisfortexas @stevefortx @KVUE Why won't they take a vaccine which has emergency use authorization to prevent getting #COVID19?Why do they want to take Regeneron which has emergency use authorization to react to getting COVID19?Are they paying the higher cost out of pocket? #ThoughtSo
112892	Good ....I hope she got the vaccine that makes you sterile...cause this world doesn‚Äôt need her offspring
108452	@thehill Sure you will deliver a vaccine this year for the Coronavirus for the politicians and the Rick
111731	After what happened with my annual flu jab this year - I'm sorry, but I don't have confidence in the Government or NHS to administer the Covid-19 vaccine on time, consistently and with the right priorities.Hopefully I'm wrong. Many people will be ok. But it's like a lottery
202149	Hey @BillGates. Just to let you know, I‚Äôm having a Chicken and Leek Pie tonight and neither you or the vaccine I had this morning had any say on my decision making whatsoever. My main influence was that it was reduced in @marksandspencer... #CovidVaccine #COVID19
109955	To anyone still dithering about whether or not to have the #COVID19 #vaccine, see below. I've come an awfully long way from initial scepticism and optimism when the pandemic first broke. Thought it would fizzle  quickly and vaccines wouldn't be needed. Boy, did I get it wrong!
112762	people are complaining that a coronavirus vaccine ‚Äòhasn‚Äôt been tested for long enough‚Äô like there isn‚Äôt a new flu strain and vaccine produced each year that they will happily get
110373	@SharylAttkisson If the COVID-19 vaccines work, then the vaccinated should be protected from the rest of us. If the vaccinated still contract the virus or any variant, then the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work, so why do they insist that we take it?
110926	So the vaccine is good for 6 months,  AFTER 2 DOSES...so where does that put Canada? Since it could be 6 months to just, maybe get a second dose...#TrudeauFailedCanada #RemoveThePM
108870	@JoelEdw85182292 @pitblackthorn @JAsakiewicz @disillusionedx @MsBlaireWhite Covid-19 already has some variations which makes the prospect of a potential vaccine more.. Complicated. Hopefully something gets figured out here soon though for I am just not sure if my sanity will hold up.
108485	@AndrewBrandt True, but it also shows their ignorance of how the MRNA vaccines work...per their own inserts they do not prevent the transmission of #COVID19. They only work as an RRR not an ARR vaccine  which means they may reduce 1 or more symptoms when you get it.
108657	"@JamarlinMartin Trump-lovers won't get the coronavirus vaccine because they ""don't know what's in it"" but will be first in line to get a McRib."
111229	This guy is gonna make a trillion dollars off this vaccine and is definitely paying media to keep the fear mongering going until every one receives it
108810	@Frances_Coppola You don't really need to take vaccines. A virus is dangerous only if you allow it to be. You just need to wear mask and follow the hygiene strictly (not because the Covid-19 is dangerous, but because you do not want to get infected)
112789	If the coronavirus vaccine has nanites in it I'd like to volunteer to try it, I'm curious what the mind control aspect feels like.
111218	Why are people in such an unseemly hurry to start dining out and drinking in closed bars and restaurants? The virus is not on a holiday. It may be wafting towards you from the,next table of laughing, chatting youngsters. Wait for the vaccine #covid19 #stayhome
111570	Like a 7.. don‚Äôt know how life will ever go back to normal before a vaccine. I may be young but I have asthma and have had bouts of bronchitis. Worried about my mom and grandma.. the fact that you can be asymptomatic is just ü§Ø. Also read that it‚Äôs causing miscarriages sooo. 7.
109922	@PointCounterpt @marsha_vivinate I have a lot of symptoms of COVID-19 so going to take a test before I get the vaccine just to be safe. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs COVID. I think I just never got rid f my bronchitis.
112263	Getting ready to delegate all my COVID-19 masks to an huge bonfire. Get the vaccine, and let's bring good times back by tossing all the f--king idiots that want to still wear these disguises to manipulate the rest of us in an huge dumpster with the rest of the trash!
109058	We need a global #vaccination effort or the pandemic will never end, and with new mutations of #Covid all it takes is for 1 variant to become resistant to vaccines and treatments to keep the virus a constant threat to all the people in the world.
111245	Coronavirus is fucking up the entire world, but some how niggas think the vaccine is a conspiracy to take them out? Lmaoooo
109223	@nytimes If the study that states after getting the coronavirus you have immunity for only 3 months, wouldn‚Äôt a vaccine also protect you for only 3 months?
111008	@Chriswb71 @elle91 I don't care either way because if no vaccine is found what then occurs?Death rate of regular Flu goes down and Covid19 stays on actuarial charts which will go down as well but not enough to equal. It burns itself out and pops up occasionally.Like H1N1.
110566	Isnt that illegal?If not,WHY?WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC FOR PETE'S SAKE! I WANT THINGS AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE..this is why things can't get better, people like that! The hypocrites are getting the vaccine on the low low or in their back yards but telling the uninformed don't get it! Ughh
110448	@Cast45J Oh good grief. There‚Äôs no vaccine for coronavirus, have you not been paying attention? So being ‚Äúunvaccinated‚Äù (or frankly an illegal alien) has nothing to do with anything.

112557	@aravosis No worries. We Japanese always wear a face mask. I took PCR, and I'm negative. But I haven't taken vaccine yet. (I won't receive it)Olympians got COVID-19 even if they had received vaccine already.... Why did they bring it to Japan?
112637	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19 and the May 4 pledging conference must be a success. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
108762	@onekade The coronavirus vaccine likewise is designed to protect the vaccinated person from the coronavirus to a certain degree, in the event that the person catches the coronavirus. This is why emphasizing the protective qualities of vaccines is so important.
108365	Sooner or later people will twig, the virus is still out there with no vaccine and no anti-viral remedy! What are we going to do then?
110507	"""Kicking the can down the road""? How we defeated epidemics before there were vaccines - denying diseases their human fuel until they burned out #C4News #coronavirus"
112280	@WhiteHouse What would be great is not only for a vaccine for the coronavirus, but also a vaccine against tRump and the GOP.  But alas, the only vaccine against the last two is to vote them out.  See you in Nov a**holes.
110227	@BillBlair @JustinTrudeau @MBGov @redcrosscanada We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
110137	"@AlexHinman @ThomasP84610247 @Jencie31 @ljpas2 @it_distraction COVID-19 ""vaccines"" are designed to do is reduce your symptoms if or when you get infected. They are not designed to prevent infection, they do not give you immunity against SARS-CoV-2,"
202206	@nsgov I got my first dose(Pfizer) 21+ days ago, but less than 28. Based on NACI and Pfizer I'm eligible. Will I be turned away?NACI: For mixed COVID-19 vaccine schedules, the minimum interval between doses should be based on the minimum interval of the product used for the first dose
109394	@lowrider5550 @HollyBriggeman Paul - I'm working off CDC website numbers.You're welcome to think what you want, but the data stands: 2-5% mortality is INCREDIBLY deadly for a novel coronavirus that's contagious and has no known vaccine or prophylactic treatment.
202444	"Not only did this information circulate MONTHS before vaccines were be distributed, but the pharmacist that gave me my first dose told me exactly this. ""Flu like"" symptoms are expected after your second dose. This is insignificant compared to actual COVID19 symptoms."
110989	@GloriousPunjab1 @HommeGuapo Religious heads should be happy. Fear of going to #hell will spur their buisness and followers!Perhaps if they give clarion call for #disarmament or giving up robbery as an insurance against #Covid19 the world would be better!
107837	They couldn't figure out how to give this 100 yr old war and peace hero a vaccine?  Unbelievable disgrace!
111186	@TTolman @ForecasterEnten It's a coronavirus, and we know from experience that human immunity to coronaviruses is 1-2 years. The end game is most likely you get your annual coronavirus shot just like the flu vaccine.
110489	Hopefully once this coronavirus vaccine comes out I wanna see everyone flaunting it like they got the new iPhone
108865	@elonmusk So did @elonmusk get the vaccine for Covid19 and if not will he ever get the Covid19 vaccine or just wait for herd immunity?
112536	@SkyNews Correction: virtually everyone is going to get coronavirus, regardless of age or vaccination status. Whitty has already said this. It is now endemic and we'll all catch it if we haven't already - vaccines mitigate symptoms, but don't stop spread. It's not just about children
111270	My favorite part about @trading212 is that when important events happen such as a Coronavirus vaccine being found, their platform and servers completely freeze and you can't buy or sell anything. I absolutely love it, would recommend to anyone.
110341	If you really believed vaccines don‚Äôt work, you wouldn‚Äôt have to sabotage them in order to ‚Äúprove‚Äù your point.... if they don‚Äôt work, they would just not-work on their own. All this proves is that you are a malicious asshole
111001	@katemacrae @pipegreentrust @bbcmtd @BBCSpringwatch @LichMercury @WeLoveLichfield It's awful üò¢ There are good people in the world but if intelligent alien life watched us from another planet they'd think the human race were the virus and SARS Covid-19 the vaccine trying to protect Earth.

109711	@startelegram Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
110195	Even if this can be resolved, how many people will refuse to take the #COVID19vaccine (if one is actually found and approved) thus rendering it useless? And they will be right not to take it given the risks of #COVID19 to anyone under 70 is near 0.00%.
112783	Had my first COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine on Friday. Only reactions so far: some chills, but it is in the single digits here, weird dizziness didn't last long &amp; no high temperature. So far so good.
107809	The @voxdotcom video on ‚ÄúWhy you shouldn‚Äôt compare Covid-19 vaccines‚Äù is brilliant. For anyone who has even a little doubt about what a vaccine does and all the other jargons, do watch this one!! Brilliant content. #COVID19 #vaccine
110683	@FaithBr77590779 Can anyone please explain to the people why exactly there is lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulating self anplifying MRNA inside of the Coronavirus structure?If not, then the goverments can shove there fake vaccine agenda up their arses. I think that‚Äôs only fair don‚Äôt you?
111933	@IreneSans Yes I heard that. Also virtual NWA in September. I am not traveling without a vaccine (and I also did a report on how we manage tornadoes alongside COVID-19 - I will submit the abstract in August once I get the reviewed version done).
111119	Cause they had/have a govt that doesn't give a damn-why ya think they are again or on constant lock down? Hey how days in a row with ZERO deaths? Unless they have a secret vaccine-wouldn't put that past the CCP since they created it! whoops-fake news-could never happen! Right?
111252	I'm wearing a double mask for another yr. And disposable gloves. Covid can stay on metal surfaces for 7 days, so disposable gloves as well. My immune system probably couldn't withstand the vaccine.  I've been inside, except for the mailbox. And I alcohol all my mail. ‚ô•Ô∏èüåéüêªüêù
112618	More Americans have died for COVID than perished in WWI. These past couple of months will be taught in school to future generations. Will be interesting to see how this is all remembered. My thoughts go out to the folks who are toiling away, working on a vaccine. #COVID19
107877	Well, my wife and I got our boosters. The question in my mind is whether we will need one every 6 months. It's going to be interesting. #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #COVIDVaccination #COVID
111957	So far I‚Äôve seen on social media today that the super elite used George Soro‚Äôs money to pay a lab in China to create the Covid-19 virus to prepare the way for a new world order so Bill Gates can put a microchip in your vaccine so you‚Äôll be doomed to hell. That about sums it up.ü§£
110741	The more pompous elitist wanna be fascist like this push Covid19 vaccine the more my resolve hardens.  I will NEVER get a vaccine for a virus with a GD 99% survival rate! NEVER! I ain't a sheep who jumps when my media overlords snap their fingers!

111623	Not great news, but it does explain the changes I‚Äôve noticed and how I‚Äôve felt since having Covid-19 back in January. I consistently told my wife I‚Äôve changed &amp;  the quoted paragraph above is exactly what I‚Äôve been saying. Also post exercise fatigue. Vaxxed same day I caught it.

111609	@CurtisHouck @tedcruz The vaccine only covers the person who received it from getting really seriously ill of the Coronavirus.  You can still get the virus.  Just like 5800 people who got the virus after they received the vaccine. Wear a mask.    But you can't fix stupid, like Ted Cruz.

111427	@drjfrank @kevinpurcell Which is closer to #covid19, SARS or measles? Being a learned PHD, tell me why there isn't a SARS vaccine after all these years.   In the meantime, what about IV vitamin C, liposomal vitamin C, or chaga mushrooms? Are you only interested in things you can patent?
112395	@V_4_Vendatta Sadly this is true. We see the vaccine injured patients in the hospitals everyday. The ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù for covid19 is absolutely going to be a lethal injection to the immune system.
110952	@shaunsi57094640 @eNCA @TheRealClementM The vaccination we took made us to be 100% immune. But covid-19 vaccines do not give us immunity. Actually keeping my mask on and taking necessary vitamins and minerals provides me with more prevention than vaccination. In about 6 months these vaccines will need some boots. üíâüíâ
112001	Good news for once: 17 March 00:30 GMT ‚Äî First vaccine clinical trials begin in the United States. The first phase I clinical trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine has begun in Seattle, Washington.
110604	This is really the good news that we've all been waiting for re the vaccine. Not only will we be better protected, but there's less risk we'll be harming others.
112670	So, 6% of the US has contracted covid-19 so far.On those figures they'll reach herd immunity at between 3.5M to 4.6M death. How much they can cut this figure all depends on how fast the vaccine roll outs go. Scary.
202301	Today,I received my first COVID-19 Vaccine Stab @cvspharmacy! So grateful for those administering this valuable vaccine. Praying in Jesus‚Äô name 4 an end to this pandemic. 2nd Vaccine stab is scheduled...#modernavaccine #painless #partlyvaccinated #StayHealthy #EndThePandemic https://t.co/U8QqarrG7m
109583	You have comes as good supporting actor in covid-19 filmüòÑthere is no doubt about itIndia is with Modiji and always will be.GDP??? China??? Vaccine Progress?
110881	@GameSetMatch000 @shaw_2_raw @imdaniel00 But for the flu jab, they are guessing. They have to predict mutations/strains. With coronavirus, we literally know the exact virus. There's no excuse for such a low effective rate when you have all the info.
111468	Anybody who thinks these Pharmaceutical companies working on a vaccine for the virus will give it to other countries for free need their head examined they wont be giving it to the NHS for free either
112442	@BrianT2112 @ann_resists @thedailybeast Herd immunity means 30% of population will die  Get Vaccine Covid19 is survivable hower 85% of unvaccinated patients are dieing please get the Vaccine
202136	I‚Äôm confused. Am I now chipped with a tracking device with this #CovidVaccine or is my DNA being altered? These Qnuts, say all this while still insisting we thank the #FormerGuy for the vaccine they won‚Äôt get. Yup, right on top of that. üôÑ#COVID #COVID19 #vaccine #vaccinated
202325	This #fucker got the vaccine &amp; his boss said it was a damn hoax. I actually work in nursing homes and I dont when I'm gonna get it. #GOPBetrayedAmerica #HypocriteRubio
111228	This is what happens when you ignore the pandemic and pretend that everything is going to be okay and tell people not to get the vaccine. This is the end result of science misinformation. How sad
109919	my fam is now currently in its second covid-19 breakout since the pandemic started... the first time was because there were no vaccines out... this time it‚Äôs because my brother decided he was immune and didn‚Äôt need the vaccine... he just scheduled his first dose
111391	Okay so they‚Äôre telling the unvaccinated to get #COVID19 vaccine because ‚Äòit works‚ÄôBut telling the vaccinated to get a  #BoosterJab because because the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work MAKE IT MAKE SENCE
110963	My mom &amp; others apparently believe that #COVID19 was weaponized by China. They believe that #Fauci is being paid to push the vaccines because it's big money &amp; not actually beneficial. They want no vaccine, no masks &amp; everything as it was before. What is going on in the world?
112700	@GovLarryHogan @MdPublicSchools - A March 1st reopening goal is not realistic. We need to have all teachers and staff get a second dose of the vaccine and two weeks to develop immunity. There just aren't enough vaccines yet.
111262	Vaccine won‚Äôt‚Äúget rid of‚Äùvirus.‚ÄùMight‚Äùlessen symptoms if u get Covid.‚ÄùMight‚Äùprotect you from getting it 2some‚Äùunknown degree‚Äù4‚Äùunknown‚Äùperiod.No studies on longterm side effects.NO ONE has a right 2try 2invade my body/risk my health w/a foreign substance w/threats 2my freedoms!
108205	SAFE is the key word. Just like suggesting Black and Brown and low-income kids should return to school first, they're gonna try to make Black/Brown folx the guinea pigs for this vaccine. Not having it. Go head start in the burbs.
108287	The Chinese Communist Party has publicly condemned Japan's decision to provide the coronavirus vaccine to Taiwan.  We will never forgive the Chinese Communist Party to interfere with vaccine support to Taiwan.#TaiwanCheering

112684	@AuthenticVegas @NPR One improvement would be those instant tests they say exist but are not approved by the FDA.But a vaccine is the only real answer at this point.Better hope it happens fast, Denmark is euthanizing all mink due to a mutated coronavirus spreading back to humans.
108685	I'm not an anti vaxxer I have had 2 doses of AZ, but I have my concerns about giving a healthy child a coronavirus jab. My 2 will certainly not be getting it anytime soon!
111977	@badassday More political shenanigans?- #coronavirus in flu strain since 2003 (Glasgow University keeps records for annual flu)- #COVID„Éº19 is this epidemic- Tests are for #coronavirus- New vaccine will be for #coronavirusNOTE: All MSM &amp; politicians now call it #coronavirusü§î
107788	I guess they can't justify going in to test their vaccine in Africa, what will they do?.. Btw, this is an insulting headline, this is what racism looks like. Everywhere else containment is key. In Africa it's poverty, really???
109694	"@MarketsCafe If you get the COVID-19 vaccine, you can't donate blood or plasma ""because it's completely tainted."""
108191	@petemorristwit If you're particularly at risk from Covid-19 it may make sense for you to take a vaccine, but if you're not then there's no need to bother.
108741	@RealLimerickMan @MaryFusillo @chadloder @thepacketrat Flue season last for but a few months in the colder times, it also has a vaccine (that alot of Americans don't take then wonder why they have the highest deaths from flu) Covid-19 does not and is world wide in different climates killing thousands at a time, you heartless mf
109481	There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Wash hand frequently with sanitizers. #FightCovid19
108040	We tolerate mediocrity. If other countries would like to have world class vaccines with efficacy rate of 95 % ( Pfizer and Moderna )  , then we set up ourselves to have mediocre immune response. Still, 50 percent sounds like a far cry from 95 percent.
111196	@RexKwasiDanquah Covid19 vaccine is not even a vaccine,the yellow fever has stood the test of time, there's adequate research on the effects and also it has proven to be effective on like the virus which had not yet been fully understood, don't compare the two
202258	Yes it is a great achievement and I am pleased that I had my first jab today. All we need now is good leadership to make sure we exit lockdown following the science and data and don‚Äôt let the virus get a grip and chance to mutate.
109203	@Confidence101 @LesStonehouse There is no Coronavirus vaccine yet... hopefully soon. It will save hundreds if not thousands of lives.
107980	@VonWedekind what do you think about this coronavirus? are we going to have a vaccine? are we going to get out of quarantine, ever?
110655	"She is a beautiful soul. All this dying is so sad. Those who think it's a hoax, should not be allowed to get medical treatment for Covid or the vaccine...after all it is just a ""HOAX""."
202053	Why are you so late it should have been mandatory vaccinations from day 1 of the Vaccines. I had first dose months ago of Astragenica the second was in July.
107985	No one‚Äòs going back to school for 2 years. It just can‚Äôt happen. Not till we have a vaccine &amp; mass production of that vaccine. Not just testing! Because people who‚Äôve already had COVID-19 are getting reinfected in China. So we don‚Äôt necessarily get immunity.V sad scary times
111515	This is the only sensible choice, otherwise we'll continue to get small pockets of outbreaks indefinitely until we get a vaccine. If we get a vaccine
111190	@CurlyDreads I also personally don‚Äôt get the flu vaccine however coronavirus is much more serious than the flu in that it can have long term health effects. I would never want to be the guy who gets it and is fine but passes it on to another young healthy person who then develops lung issues.
109337	If you‚Äôve been reading pseudoscience about COVID-19 vaccines, please reconsider. If you are uncomfortable about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, please reconsider. Someone in my family just died from COVID. They were fully vaccinated.Enough is enough.#COVID19
108806	'..a conservative pastor named Curt Landry has warned his followers never to accept an eventual vaccination for the coronavirus. ‚ÄúThat vaccine is from the pit of Hell,‚Äù Landry said. ‚ÄúDo not pray for those vaccines, and do not take the vaccine.‚Äù '
110606	Is this the only medical condition you use to openly discriminate against potential customers? If I have a cold, the flu, chicken pox, strep throat, or measles can I come in? What if I have a positive covid test but don't tell you &amp; just flash a vaccine card, we good then?
109750	@GilbertsBlake And when a #Vaccine is made I will say No Thank You bc I don't need or want the #CoronaVirus #Mercury #Aluminum #Formaldehyde &amp; other Poisons in my body. #BiologicalWarfare has arrived Again.
111077	A new study suggests?We‚Äôve been saying this for 2 years. Good job you have out free donuts for the vaccine and closed all the gyms though eh?
108532	@jt_hoopdreams11 I believe we need a vaccine before we can consider going back to normal. It appears the young folks are the Carrie's that are taking COVID-19 back home to their parents/grandparents.. Just my Opinion though..
109668	Why covid vaccine would be free for Bihar only. Does Bihar got and special status as Kashmir got in past??Isn't Bihar equal to other states or is it vote bank game?
111085	Just think of it this way:Prime #Loki is the CoronavirusHis Variants are toxic mutationsThe TVA is the vaccineWe do not want the variants spreading.Get vaccinated!
111260	I hope with this surge Nigerians that  said they've formulated a cure will be given audience to prove their claim. If we are going to keep waiting for only the white man to formulate a vaccine then to God be the glory.
112727	@11thHour You guys are pushing that vaccine coming out before Election Day when we know how long it typically takes for a vaccine to get approved! That and keeping sports going in spite of players getting the coronavirus! You are becoming state run media just like Fox News!
202160	Got my 2nd dose of Covid-19 Vaccine today. Fully vaccinated ‚ù§Ô∏è #COVID19Vaccination #Sinovac https://t.co/Na2H5gb1LS
109986	It's his job to keep pushing the fear, he is cashing in on the vaccine when it comes and he needs us to believe that is the  only cure. However, he is wrong, if this virus came from the lab it will lose it's deadliness, also therapies are working around the world. #novaccine
112178	@GeorgeTakei I dont care what I would ever read online. To think taking a horse dewormer would be more succesful than a vaccine, I encourage you to take it then. You know coronavirus isnt a worm right? Its like taking a laxitive to get ride of cancer.
111992	@MimiJ9 @SebastienneL Don't be fooled.The masons,the Illuminati,others will take only the Flu vaccine twice. The humans,the targeted individuals,the poor,the useless eaters will be for some shot twice with the covid-19 vaccines or the luckiest one Flu and one covid vaccine.All to reduce the population
202323	Today marks the rollout of the second Covid-19 vaccine. Brian Pinker, a patient at Churchill hospital on dialysis for kidney disease, was the first to receive the jab this morning.Are you booked in to have yours yet?https://t.co/qTv99yUJzW
202188	WDH has reported administering about 83 percent of the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines and nearly 32 percent of the second dose. #COVID19WY
202270	My father got the 2nd dose of vaccine to fight against #COVID19 at Qatar hospital District west Abbu are completely fine and doing well. Thanks to @SindhHealthDpt for their good services. I would request all tweeps to register your parents and get them vaccinated.
109938	#i keep why Americans can't a drug/vaccines for the covid-19 while china has already take care of their citizens are that victims of coronavirus and ,they are back to work
109150	Violating protocols is going to a party or not having a mask on. Homeboy submitted a fake vaccine card
109894	I won‚Äôt be getting the COVID-19 vaccine until there are credible studies regarding the long term side effects. If it works, the people who get the vaccine shouldn‚Äôt be worried about us who don‚Äôt get it going about our normal, daily lives.
108443	I can be able to get vaccine to cure this Coronavirus base on my knowledge on virology but the goverment will never support me  #coronavirus
109085	@_Stetters @HogsHaven It's about as experimental as any flu shot. They've been making Coronavirus vaccines for decades. And with people actually believing there's microchips and mutant powers in the vaccine, it's easy to see why the govt would incentivize it
108603	@MichiganOnBTN @Ronnieb_8 @DavidOjabo @emilyehman @UMichFootball I think this is the right time to invest especially now that coronavirus making our job and economic slow down. Why not try  @tyron_robert7  platform out with ‚Ç¨1,000 to earn ‚Ç¨4,200
107833	This is completely nuts‚Ä¶..The vaccine is still emergency use only. It is not approved by the FDA in the US. Studies are showing that it does not stop the spread of Covid.
108015	Tbh all those refusing to take the vaccine pls go out and lick the ground so u can speed up the process and we‚Äôll have less uneducated ppl in the world ‚ù§Ô∏è #COVIDIOTS #vicroadmap #DanAndrews #COVID19
111223	@MikeJWake @JuliaHB1 There is not going to be a vaccine for this strain, we will have to live with COVID-19 as we do all the others &amp; of course the issue you have missed is, what happens if the virus mutates vin the next 12 months, do we stay locked down for ever?

110247	@mtgreenee You are forcing people to get the Coronavirus &amp; the Variants that is being spreading all over the place. There is 1 party to be blamed for this. The Republican party. #Covid19 would have never killed anyone without Trump's supporters being too chicken to get the vaccine.
112849	When do the delivery peeps or retail workers get there‚Äôs? Food workers? 100% whoever delivered those vaccines doesn‚Äôt get a vaccine.
110706	@MissBeck12 @GovAndyBeshear People who recover from COVID-19 develop antibodies for only a certain amount of time and can get COVID-19 again within a few months. It has happened in my family before.The vaccines set to stop you from getting it again. That‚Äôs what vaccines do.
111182	Or perhaps it's because the government, the doctors and the media spread fear. Telling you that you must get the vaccine and then saying you're still not safe. Start there. Fortunately, half the country is on to you.
202088	My parents received the first dose of the Pfizer #COVID19 vaccine a few minutes ago at the @ArmoryNYC, thank you @nyphospital for ensuring such a smooth process. üôåüèΩüôåüèΩCC: @jabcommunity &amp; @MariaALuna https://t.co/klAonKkBFG

109552	@hedgehogkibble @TeresaABacon2 @WINDOCTORRX @PrezTeamtrump Then how come vaccinated peopl are getting COVID-19 if the vaccine is so damn good.
110181	You‚Äôd think this would be the main news story ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è..... instead more scare tactics about an Indian variant that the vaccine covers ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. We couldn‚Äôt have a world where the main news outlets share too much positivity though could we üñïüèª
111813	"Es gratis, no se quejen: ""How effective is AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine? We still don't have a clear, consistent answer. Some peer-reviewed, others not ‚Äî have suggested the vaccine could be anywhere from 22% to 90% effective"" Business Insider @pauletta_sofia @Rodpac @rivapa"
108232	There it is People that don't want a rushed through vaccine THAT could cause more trouble in the long run will be forced to stay at home.  When they state compulsion to that makes me want to say NO ANYWAY for the hell of it. What happens if you've got a boinked immune system ?
108837	To be fair , Pfizer did not come up with this vaccine on their on . It was in collaboration with Biontech a Germany Bio company . Again I repeat, the Trump admin was not involved in any way financially. Again the vaccine still has to go through final clinical stages for approval
110556	Since I am 82 and do not have suicidal tendencies, l eagerly took the Coronavirus vaccine. With the vaccine, if I unfortunately get infected, my chance of survival is enhanced. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúno brainer‚Äù

110019	@NYCMayor I got tested positive last week to #COVID19 - when I asked my doctor for a monoclonal antibody he refused because im not 65 y/o or fat - why is it that there's so much vaccines out there but when someone is sick with 104.6 fever and all symptoms he get refued treatment?
108051	Then ofcourse they're sayng there's a new strain of the coronavirus so they'll be giving a vaccine every year like they do for the flu. They take last year's virus strain and explain to you why the vaccine may not work... bye yo....
112645	Will COVID-19 disappear if we isolate for weeks or months? If it started with 1 person, will it be eradicated by isolation. I doubt anyone is ready for forced quarantines. There won‚Äôt be a vaccine soon, if at all. If humans cope thru herd immunity, how do we get there from here?
201828	I received my 2nd COVID-19 vaccine today. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated now. I plan to still wear my mask to comply with @OHdeptofhealth recommendation. @GreenswellCraig

110320	A little confused about this one. Is this a low number when it comes to mass vaccines. I don‚Äôt like how Ford has handled this rollout but I hope we only criticize when due. If you are an expert on mass vaccine would like to know expectations.
108271	@Rachelhouda @kurteichenwald @RealCandaceO What about people who get the coronavirus and get over it? How do they compare to those who get vaccinated? Will the vaccine that doesn't exist yet be proof against the disease? What % of immune deficient persons are incapable of getting vaccinated? What do they do about strep?
109287	Everyone bitching about a vaccine for coronavirus is awfully ironic since America has been indoctrinated with all this antivax bullshit, so half of y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt even get a vaccine anyways and we would STILL be screwed sooooo #WASH #YOUR #HANDS
108143	It's good to push back on misinformation regarding the pandemic, even if it's family. #coronavirus  #COVID„Éº19  #CoronavirusVaccine  #CoronaVaccine  #CoronavirusPandemic
111173	Also I know it‚Äôs tough but if someone you know gets the coronavirus vaccine please don‚Äôt immediately make them feel guilty for getting it before you/your mom/your partner/etc. There is limited supply and huge demand. I didn‚Äôt choose when I got it, the state did
108475	"@D_Kuehn Covid-19 will return to Denmark and other countries where it is ""under control"". It is a matter of time. We cannot eradicate this. Only a vaccine or some form of herd immunity can do that.Americans need to stop the hysteria. Life has to go on. It is not presently."
108939	@Mmfchick @CarsonJaymes @Breaking911 I do believe in the flu vaccine.  I get one every year and it‚Äôs helped me from getting the flu since I work in a hospital.  Most people who don‚Äôt get the flu shot will be lining up for this coronavirus vaccine when it‚Äôs available.
108832	@PAULEGWILSON @ReformRambo Wonder how much their selling Covid-19 for in this shop...or is it 2 vaccines and get the 3rd free üôÑ#Lunacy
110480	@mbradhoo @GovofCO So if it slows the rates why are the rates up so much?The healthcare system has never had a coronavirus issue in many years, they have a staffing issue!! Exactly, so why is only the unvaxxed getting tested when the vax‚Äôd can easily be a host and spread it? Many case in points
111777	Over 100 million Americans have now received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. We're making good progress - keep it up! (I get my 2nd shot in about 1 1/2 weeks) #GetVaccinated #ThisIsOurShot
109950	‚ÄúGiven the uncertainty about the two vaccines, their EUAs are explicit that each is ‚Äúan investigational vaccine not licensed for any indication‚Äù and require that all ‚Äúpromotional material relating to the Covid-19 Vaccine clearly and conspicuously ‚Ä¶

111517	This has been something I've been curious about.... is this vaccine that's currently being rolled out going to be effective against this new variant or any other which we may still have to experience?
112929	Starting to get VERY high marks in our handling of the Coronavirus (China Virus), especially when compared to other countries and areas of the world. Now the Vaccines (Plus) are coming, and fast!
111170	Breaking news.  Just as predicted, @covid mutating and vaccines may be ineffective. NO vaccine for a @coronavirus has ever been effective. Just like flu virus, it is constantly mutatinghttps://t.co/0fruduG8n6

108291	@jojojojoos @avux99 @AuthenticallyAL @kezjacko @meepeedee @AstraZeneca I'm so sorry and I hope you get well soon. Could you please tell me if you were tested for covid-19 after the AstraZeneca vaccine?
108620	This is quite tone deaf. If the last year hasn't already had my wife and I both considering leaving Emergency Medicine, a vaccine mandate will likely seal the deal. Staffing shortages will certainly compound with this foolishness.
108448	@TomJChicago President Trump didn‚Äôt lie about a vaccine. They‚Äôre are cures already out there. Coronavirus‚Äôs are multiple. We‚Äôve had 6 deaths in USA. But we‚Äôve ad 40000 deaths this year in USA for another strain of flu that did have the flu shot.  So if this is also manufactured then...
108302	If you are in my state of California, Governor Newsom has announced that distribution could possibly start as early as tomorrow. Will you be taking the Wuhan / Covid-19 Vaccine when the time comes?

110345	Why are we the ones always crying against everything? When will this change? No one owes us a vaccine, ma @MaEllenSirleaf. We must learn to produce our own. There is nothing global about a national innovation. Produce yours. Statements like these only shows how entitled we are.
107949	If @realDonaldTrump is involved in any way, shape or form with the Vaccine, I will NOT take it.  #COVID19 #vaccine #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaVaccine #CovidVaccine #Covid_19 #COVID
111854	@ATabarrok No herd immunity, coz it's a fast mutating coronavirus.  But T cell and natural immunity in play, like for the flu where not everybody who's exposed gets it.It also means VACCINES ARE A SCAMMY APPROACH. Vaccines have not eradicated the flu nor is it proven they reduce cases.

112542	Bill and Melinda. When are they and their children having the vaccine.   They don‚Äôt believe in vaccines at all for their children I read somewhere. Is this true??
109400	@ScottyShaps1 Is @DanaBashCNN still praising his pivot? He's done this countless times but next he behaves like a normal person, he'll praised like he found a vaccine for Covid-19 and Ebola.
112710	Vaccine development normally takes years, if not decades. But scientific teams around the world are aiming to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in 12 to 18 months.......let‚Äôs hope we never see Bill Gates vaccines, we do not need any mercury in our bodies!!!
111808	‚¨áÔ∏è is a reply to my pointing out that Biden was against the #COVID19 vaccine he now takes credit for. Doodie Giuliani is what happens when you eat paint chips. Don't be like Doodie Giuliani.
112571	@fazzyfocus 2/2 can not go out, or the people that feel vaccines are bad, are they thinking of they other people that they affect? This may sound bad but let them go out and get coronavirus maybe they will change their mind.

109831	This is false. The University System of Georgia is absolutely NOT doing everything it can. A COVID vaccine should be required for in-person classes or to live in student housing just like it requires for other diseases.
111160	"""If antibodies can fade in some patients within weeks, and if just about everyone loses them after a few months, that would render any vaccine almost completely useless."""
108847	This is an amazing thing. If you live, work or go to school in York Region and you‚Äôre 12 or older, go get vaxxed this weekend. Please!
110719	We need to have that Question sent in to the Press Secretary to check with the experts don't we? I remember back in March that came up~ Can't take the Flu Shot and the Covid Vaccine they don't work well together..
202432	@johncardillo Having just left one cult, I feel like I'm being forced into another.  I'm going to lose my mind with all these crazy mask-wearing #covid19 vaccine-pushing conspiracy theorists surrounding me everywhere I go
112796	@destini92664 Can someone please tell me where in the fuck we have ever created an effective vaccine for ANY #coronavirus? The answer is we haven't because they mutate too fast. The only long term solution is #NaturalImmunity.
110594	Instead of offering those who have survived #COVID19 a vaccine they should be offered an anti-body test. If their levels equal what a vaccine would provide, they should not be inoculated until/unless their anti-body levels drop below what a vaccine would provide, no?
111486	The @WHO declared thr coronavirus a pandemic, we need to put all resources on vaccine research asap, this is no longer politics.
109011	@NeilMackay Neil, Do you know what a Coronavirus does when it encounters a Vaccine, IT MUTATES. Even IF everyone in the World was Vaxed, it would Mutate &amp; just continue on. YOU Can Not Stop a Coronavirus no matter how much you try.  Dont believe me, ask its cousin the FLU.

108183	Sounds like BS to me, too, but I'm curious: Has this been observed with other vaccines? If it has been, even once, it's worth considering; if it's never been observed, I think we can relegate the claim to the BS department.
111891	"I asked my doctor if I was eligible (yes on some resources, no on others??) for the vaccine, and if so, how could I get it. When I apologized for being confused about the process, and he said ""it's just as confusing for healthcare providers. I don't know, I'll try to find out."""

109622	For the immunologists out there.If a person has had COVID19 what benefit is there in taking a vaccine?Are there any enhanced risks in vaccination of a previously infected person?I'm asking because I genuinely have no idea.
108623	It seems Europeans are the main culprits spreading it, luckily Cuba has a good healthcare system and I'd probably bet they would have a big influence on creating a vaccine in the near future
109725	@DaneHoelting @AriIaccarino @ChandlerIsOkay @shawtyknowz @Primrxze1 @slightworkkk_ And even that is not proven. imagine if someone never caught covid-19 before getting vaxxed and then they get it after the fact, there is no way they can confirm that their symptoms would have been less severe if they didn‚Äôt get vaxxed. Covid-19 itself has a 99,6% survival rate.
108686	@simondolan This is the agenda, vaccinate everyone, the test cannot differentiate from the common cold, the flu and covid-19 or any other virus. Crisis management rule 1 - don‚Äôt panic the people. They want you to panic so you get the vaccine, they want this to implode

107974	Total coincidence this story broke right after the election. Trump has been saying for weeks that a vaccine was coming shortly, not one news outlet reported on it. Now Trump‚Äôs out, the vaccine is here, the ü¶† is gone &amp; all is well in the üåé. We‚Äôre getting played, open your eyes.

112945	@WinkyMcDinky @TPettitt51 @J47194716 @Alhasaniv @POTUS They didn't reduce Jack for my cousin. How do you reduce death when the person still dies?This vaccine does zero to stop the spread of COVID-19 or lessen the symptoms, it has more side effects than the actual virus does.
111792	@wgang1616 Everyone will get COVID19, it is not going to go away unless alternative medicine is used.  The vaccine does not stop you from getting or transmitting it.

109689	Nah this ppl psycho. Just get the damn vaccine. All it does is give your body coding to the virus so that it can recognize it and fight it off before you get extremely sick or hospitalized and in time once everyone gets it, prevent it from mutating and eventually eradicated

112744	Not surprised, but still so very angry! üò°üò°üò° How many more people will die in the time it takes to fix this? As a high risk disabled person, I still can‚Äôt get a vaccine. American exceptionalism at work ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

110092	@J4LYN @theCULTiE People in England I‚Äôve talked to say this vaccine/these vaccines raises immunity as in it‚Äôs not a 100% guarantee of not getting Covid-19...&amp; it‚Äôs worth it cuz it/they raise immunity. And they‚Äôre fine w/the Covid-19 vaccine passport, cuz there‚Äôs vaccine passports already.. üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
201838	Since I took Covid-19 vaccine I had bad side effect late at night my body temperature dropped I had to wear jumper socks to warm up for few hours I was shivering but did not have fever but today my body i do not feel right feel tired not able to do activities
108426	@CBarnesPT @daniel_kraft @WSJ @RanBalicer @ClalitHealth I don't know. I commend their aggressive Covid19 vaccine rollouts. But they should not leave out Palestinians this pandemic is impacting everyone around the world especially the most vulnerable.
108384	12/20 Carlson ranted about the COVID-19 vaccinations. ‚ÄúThey are planning to force you to take the coronavirus vaccine. It‚Äôs so safe, they have to threaten you to take it,‚Äù he falsely claimed (there are no current government plans to force COVID vaccines, or any other vaccinations
108885	a covid-19 vaccine has been announced and everyone wants to bash the president. This is potentially a huge step in getting our lives back to normal, but people are to bitter to let go even in victory.
202085	Got my first Pfizer jab Feb 23.  Deltoid was a little sore for a day or so.  Experienced no other side effects except felt a little fatigued that night, next day.
111709	Fantastic news that another Covid19 vaccination service has opened up in South Notts. Well done to everyone who has worked hard to get this up and running. Don't forget, the NHS will contact you when it's your turn for the vaccine üëá
112175	It doesn‚Äôt matter to the Trump administration if you die before you get the coronavirus vaccine what matters is that they make profits for one of their campaign donors. We need to know what other vaccine candidates this admin supposedly has and who they are connected to.
110231	@LubaK19260165 @ShaneCoombs @JoeSilverman7 There‚Äôs never before been a vaccine for a coronavirus for humans. And in animals they have actually caused more problems than they solve. We need to really make sure this is safe before we jump. I personally would not be first in line for this one.

108616	FAUCI: He's cautiously optimistic about a covid-19 vaccine because studies so far show that the body does mount an immune response both to the virus itself, and to vaccines in early trials. That response doesn't happen with HIV. So a covid-19 vaccine is much easier to make.
111989	please remember that the vaccine does not prevent us from contracting COVID-19 (we are examples), we can still get it if we are not careful. So, I request those of you who have got the vaccine, to continue to take care as before (wearing mask, social distancing etc).
111474	Confused about what the #VaccineStrategy will be like? #CowinApp will be very crucial for people like you and me. #vaccine

202004	I feel so grateful and privileged to have received the COVID-19 vaccine today. I‚Äôm hopeful that many others will soon have access so we can better protect our most vulnerable and each other. It‚Äôs still a long road ahead but it‚Äôs great to finally see some light! https://t.co/kUG7YyxT5l
111023	@HHwfc @Cris_Without_H @radude6 @BBCWorld Yes, but the MRNA vaccine has been in development for a decade. My understanding is that HIV is difficult because it takes years to present in your system, but a coronavirus‚Äôs impact is virtually immediate, making it easier for the vaccine to work.

112865	@CNN I believe COVID-19 is man made, and this vaccine is not safe, but rather going to damage humanity.
110943	@SizweLo There was never will be successful vaccines for coronavirus.... It failed before and it will fail this time...... The previous attempt on SARS and MERS also caused death in animals and neurological problems in humans.....
111779	How can you possibly say this with confidence when the science doesn‚Äôt exist yet?! There have been no long-term studies on what this jab will do to women trying to conceive, pregnant women, and newborn babies because NOT ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED in order to complete such studies.
110105	One thing I'm curious about--COVID is not the only coronavirus with a spike protein. I'm genuinely curious as to whether or not the vaccine may inadvertently protect against other coronaviruses as well.Like the common cold, for instance.
108937	@ventingmyangar Andrew, allow me to share some facts with you. THERE IS NO VACCINE THAT PREVENTS COVID19. Vaccinated can still get, spread, and die from the virus. Goal of the vaccine is to lessen the symptoms should you get it. So what good is a #VaccinePassport if we all can spread the virus.
110782	We‚Äôre in Tooth Fairy territory here.‚Ä¢ We know you‚Äôve already had Covid19, so severe that you ended up in ICU.‚Ä¢ We know you‚Äôve had two vaccines.‚Ä¢ The idea that you don‚Äôt have antibodies is absurd.Stop talking to us like small children!
112891	@terryodance @danwootton I know this too Terry...and don‚Äôt you think if scientists had found a vaccine with longevity that the  world would take the same action to kill it off..it has been amazing that they have a vaccine for Covid-19 so quickly....
112340	I am so deeply cynical about this ‚Äúthe vaccines are on their way, the end is in sight everyone!‚Äù narrative I see being pushed in the media and this right here is exactly why.

112017	government has unconsciously stated that the Wuhan covid-19 is never going to go away! because they said they're going to build a facilities to produce the moderna vaccine in 2024!They said too!they have acquired 25 million vaccine!how many vaccines will U take over your lifetime
202383	@djane_go @mmfa Really! My Q 2 @TuckerCarlson is, ‚Äú did u receive a COVID19 vaccine?‚Äù If so, wtf do u knw? U took a vaccine but didn‚Äôt knw science bhind it? Tht vaccine is as good as the strain it was design 2 protect? Tht ur propaganda 2 not vaccine actually contributed 2 mutations. So stfu!
109050	Using vaccine as a bargining chip for political gain is cheap! Centre has not yet said that the vaccine will be free for all Indians but for Bihar they are promising it free for all just because they've polls. What if Bihar don't vote BJP? Will they still get it for free? Idiotic
110312	@maks_amillion @SealTurtle @SamanthaX_real The flu vaccine has had decades of research.There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine. Im sure you know why they had to stop the trials on mice and ferrets...
110433	Is Israel hoping the virus will complete the work the bullets do not? Is this the reason for slow roll out to Palestinians of the vaccine?
112471	@senatemajldr Even if you get Covid19 there is no immunity to virus and some people get it twice so we will need a reliable Vaccine.

112538	@xKELSOxTv @Will_Shirayuki @sorola Please explain how it was rushed. Lol we just invented MRNA in a few months huh? That 30 years of Coronavirus vaccine research had nothing to do with this???
110121	@BetteMidler First, hardly anyone is allergic to peanuts so they should eat their own food, not penalize everyone else. Second, coronavirus is not deadly but the vaccines are, you don't want to be pushing those. And last but not least, you're a crazy old bat who's had her day. You may go now.
108968	Imo this whole coronavirus deal has been a government plan for a long time in order for Marshall law, they will come up w a mandated vaccine which will have trackers/chips in them that we will w no choice HAVE to take. We will run out of supplies &amp; THEY will supply us w wtf knows
109981	If the common cold is in the coronavirus family of viruses, then is it reasonable to conclude no vaccine will be created for Covid-19?
108201	@Mac_D33 @KayMachitje @rramagwa You all seem to be forgetting that grade 1s will need somewhere to go. You also seem to be forgetting that the coronavirus is going nowhere until a vaccine is developed and rolled out. But good luck with those plans.
108849	@tablefloor @News24 Makes no mudaphucking sense. When  these vaccines were introduced, they said they were going to PROTECT people from catching and spreading Covid19. All those who have Omicron are fully vaccinated.  Why are other countries banning them if they are less like to spread it??
109350	@Mike22105780 @BetsyMaxwell10 @CodyElijah1 Are you including the COVID-19 vaccine because I don‚Äôt think it was investigated not for very long and obviously doesn‚Äôt last very long either get a grip find out the truth

110975	"This is why you hav to do things to somewhat ""strengthen"" immune system before taking vaccine, like perhaps a vitamin-D regimen for a 2 week period before taking vaccine. Folks with low Vitamin D levels hav been confirmed to suffer more or even die from covid"

201931	One deceased of the deceased persons was unvaccinated, one had received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and two people had received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. One was an 80s woman who was a resident of an aged care facility where she acquired her infection. RIP.
202380	Thanks to you, @POTUS Biden, I got my COVID-19 vaccine shot this past Thurs. I didn't have to call them. They called me because here in PA it was my turn being in the 65 &amp; over group. I marvel at the progress you've made in just over a month that trump had 4 years to do &amp; didn't.
110851	So tired of hearing about anti vaccine individuals reflecting on their dumbness of not getting the vaccine!! We would be close to being done with this virus if it weren‚Äôt for them!!
109940	She's overweight, a breast cancer survivor, has diabetes... Basically, a person for whom COVID-19 would cause serious illness. But no, she refuses to get vaccinated, even though she is not anti-vaccination (I think she's old enough to have the smallpox vaccine scar).
112774	You think Scott?  What are the chances he has a secret vaccine?  How come none of those close to him never get it?
108504	All this vaccine stuff has me thinking that the crazy non vaccine moms out there have actually been the smart ones all along! #novaccinesforme #COVID19 #WWG1WGA #QAnons
112595	‚ÄùNO! If I‚Äôm safe after the vaccine why should I care about anyone else?!‚Äù This really is the mindset of the right wing isn‚Äôt it? Selfishness &amp; shortsightedness, what sort of world would it be if everyone thought that. We would soon go extinct if we all thought like them #vaccine
107689	To whom it may concern, I get two to three flu shots a year. I choose not get covid19 vaccines due to religious beliefs as  a anabaptist. I don't own a TV in my house. It is my choice as a person not get a vaccine.
109652	"If you need any more reason not to vote for this White House this is it. No serious scientists and doctors are acting like herd immunity (without a vaccine) is a true option yet @realDonaldTrump appears to be embracing it. ""Pro life"" means nothing to him."

112903	Covid is seasonal , winter is there and we see how these  countries‚Äô cases are picking up (the numbers ) . Hope we all getting the jab while the ministry is getting ready for our winter ,
108513	So why can‚Äôt we , in the interest of public health, disallow any patent to the vaccine when developed?
111143	@laurenboebert @TuckerCarlson You can still get Covid-19 with the vaccine and spread it. You‚Äôre less likely to be hospitalized &amp; very unlikely to die from it. He should know this, everyone is reporting it. He‚Äôs deliberately spreading lies. You have to wonder how he lives with him self. No conscience I guess.
112902	Not everyone is going to get a vaccine...not everyone wants a vaccine... when we eradicate the virus? That‚Äôs NEVER going to happen, COVID-19 is here to stay like the flu. If u think masks are temporary...THINK AGAIN, my guy. That shit is here FOR EH-VURRR.
110456	@Meggone2 @LJayMax @Paramythia__ I think the bio-weapon is the vaccine not the Coronavirus2019 so the elites will know not to get the vaccine. I think covid-19 is just a flu because we have a different flu every year.
108916	@Timcast What is skeptical is this doctor apparently doesn't know that if someone has COVID-19 infection already that injecting them with a vaccine wouldn't do anything since they already are producing the antibodies.
111528	If one chooses not to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to misinformation, but is the first in-line to get an anti-body infusion once they catch COVID-19... then how does that line-up and make sense? #Reflections

111163	A personal bright spot in a weird and disheartening week: My parents each got their first #COVID19 vaccine today! I won't say my home state is handling the rollout well but I will say my years of trying to get concert tickets before they sold out was put to use for a great cause!
108395	Usual clinical path of vaccine development is 5-7 years, and yet here‚Äôs the sociopath @MattHancock  betting big on a vaccine, that has been conjured up in 9 mths. Not only has this crook played out a PCR test fraud on all of us, he now wants to clean up, with a vaccine fraud..
111438	Welp the numbers are going back up, there isn‚Äôt a vaccine for kids under 12, and our governor said masking can‚Äôt be made mandatory.

108716	I won't deny the clear reduction in deaths and symptoms that the vaccine has achieved. But there are serious questions about how it has been unequally rolled out - why it wasn't made open source - as it could have been - to battle a global threat. #rentiercapitalism
109758	I‚Äôm all for motivation but what about everyone who called phone lines religiously multiple times everyday, waited in long lines, kept tabs on extra shots, and stayed home until they could get their vaccine? #wewantrewardstoo #niceguysfinishlast
108533	Very glad to hear my friend @Pres_Sandoval is only experiencing mild symptoms. Like he said, COVID-19 vaccines are doing their job, and I hope he has a quick recovery.
111396	@BNODesk We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Please help!
112795	Pfizer characterized the best vaccine because it came from trump and Merkel that's why has 3 doses they put cancer in out and in again but Johnson puted in and puted out in only one vaccine the other vaccines are just for a normal sickness like COVID-19
108023	@rjgoo Everyone will probably get the virus eventually anyways ... might as well pull the bandaids off and let it go through the population. There is NO guarantee of a vaccine as there has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus style sickness.
109997	@ukiswitheu @jwahjwah Sadly, getting the vaccine as @sajidjavid has proved, isn't the panacea they made it out to be, initially, that's another fabrication of the truth. And #Covid19 isn't like the flu, it's much worse, yet another fabrication. The truth is we don't really know the facts.
109164	Or, and bear with me here, just get a real vaccine card.  FOR FREE.  All it takes is one (or two) little shot(s).
109077	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
110522	@POTUS ... please deliver a fireside chat on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Explain how there was no plan and how your administration is going to right the ship. I think we need the truth and we need assurance that you're on this until we're all safe.
109482	Going to have COVID-19 Vaccine tomorrow. I am nervous,not about the effects that have it. It's about my order is at 7-11 now and I can't even take the order because I don't have Cram School tomorrow

112612	So I went ahead and took a test for Covid19 immunity.Turns out I was negative, so now I have to keep wearing a mask until there is a vaccine.Dammit!
201913	@BabyMeriel Yes, I do take ImmunPro most especially during the early part of the Covid-19 wave. I think, I need to buy again as my arm got a 1-week bruise gawa ng Janssen J&amp;J vaccine. Thanks for reminding me, I'll also take my vitamins regularly ulit.

108979	How are hospitalization rates increasing? Intensive care rates, death rates increasing, on breakthrough infections. ON THE SAME VARIANT?????????? How do vaccines work again?Am i the only one seeing this?
108382	I guess we'll see another variant enter the stage in 2022 and we can only hope that the vaccines or antibodies after an infection will be able to cope with that one, while COVID-19 will slowly become an endemic disease.

108831	The purpose of the #lockdown is to force the public to take  #vaccines they don't need and #RFI chip implants we don't want.#COVID19 #coronavirus #facemask #SatanicElite
107927	This cycle has already begun, and with such low thresholds for intervening and high sensitivities for Covid-19, it is likely to continue.Even when we have a vaccine covid-19 they will still keep circuit breaks and masks mandatory every winter. Fight it now because you won't get
109722	Hi @denmarkdotdk! Please help me! What's latest good news about Covid19/Coronavirus vaccines &amp; treatments? Are you well connected with other countries? If so, may you please help us in US who wanna work, but can't because we're seen as inferior &amp; about to be enslaved? Please?
111771	People of Lahore, don't forget it.. When coronavirus was only in China this govt forbid our own children to bring them back in Pakistan. Zulfi Bukhari let pass coronavirus patients - so we got coronavirus. This govt has gifted u this. Ye hamaray Punjab ko bura kahenge...
110402	@therecount No-one knows how immunity to covid-19 persists in the body because we've only known about the existence of the virus for 2 years, and we've only had vaccines for 1 year. It may be we need 3 shots, like polio or HPV, or we may need period boosters, like tetanus.
111919	@JeremyVineOn5 @jemmaforte @adepstein1 @theJeremyVine @StormHuntley @MattHancock Schools shouldn't be re-opened until we've got a vaccine or have worked out how to do social-distancing with groups of kids.If we can't do that, then we're putting all teachers and parents at risk and so it follows the rest of us.#JeremyVine #Coronavirus #Covid19
111662	@realDonaldTrump Sad ! Should kids go back to school before we get a vaccine for this virus? I don‚Äôt think so.
111420	@realDonaldTrump You not only tolerate it, u foment it! Forcing states to open up schools &amp; churches, with no coronavirus vaccine is structural violence. Not every body could afford the million dollar Regeneron cocktail they gave u. Plus u‚Äôre trying to take away ppl‚Äôs insurance amidst a pandemic!
108880	Yeah I‚Äôm done being nice, if you don‚Äôt wish others well, I don‚Äôt wish you well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if you actively refuse the vaccine and wearing mask knowing you‚Äôre endangering others then if you get sick I better see you refusing medical services too
109641	Hi I'm a budding virologist, if there is a longform that explains if it is normal to start and stop specific vaccines like this...Please send me way for my daily COVID read...
110791	@CTVNews Don‚Äôt take this the wrong way but, would she give the COVID-19 vaccine to her kids? Would Trudeau? I presume that is what they would be asking us to do.
109887	@DrGregorSmith No need for the so called vaccine. The MHRA has enough evidence on the yellow card system to declare COVID-19 vaccines unsafe for use in humans. Dr Tess Lawrie
109832	@POTUS or whoever is in charge of what happens with the COVID-19 I just wanted to say that if the vaccine doesn't go well and if people keep going out and partying and all then I think there should be another lockdown for a week or so. Nobody come at me for this please.
111687	2Sooner or later everyone will get it if the vaccine/treatment is not found.Social distancing might be a precaution today , tomorrow it will be a lifestyle. #coronavirusinindia #COVID19 #Covid_19india #CoronaWarriors #CoronaUpdatesInIndia #coronavirus
112386	Right now we are experiencing a world without one particular vaccine. If only we could do a split screen to show the world without any, just to see, just to check. #VaccinesWork #VaccinesSaveLives #COVID„Éº19
110735	And the biggest problem is if unchallenged these narratives are self-fulfilling. The policy gets shaped to the narrative -- why work harder to get limited vaccines to people who don't want them? We just went through this with overdoses and black drug users.
112874	The benefit does not outweigh the cost of widely testing. In contrast, the targeted testing strategy we've employed so far has not led to community spread. Furthermore, even if everyone tested negative, without a vaccine, we can all still contract COVID19 the next day.
108719	@jeenasingh5 @DcpNorthDelhi @DelhiPolice There's no other way. Herd immunity is the only way because the virus has already mutated into 40 strands.We must assume there won't be any vaccine for COVID-19 in the immediate future and take it head on.
109468	Exactly. There will NEVER be a zero rate of infection. A vaccinated person can still develop flu if the infecting virus strain is different than the vaccine strain. An educated guess is made each year to select the flu vaccine strain to use. Covid will be the same.
108884	Please inject me with this üôÑMy body is screwed up but I don‚Äôt get a cold #jabjabjabbyjab #makeitmakesense
110664	I say if countries or particular group of people do not want to get #Vaccine they should lose right to travel outside of their country until they do get it. Enough with stupidity!

109479	@ThomasDMiller2 Mr Gates should be processing computer chips, not my health or options. No chips in my body and no vaccine in my body either.  Big pharma scares me more than Covid19. Strange how BP can find a vaccine so fast but we can‚Äôt cure CANCER,the money makes for BP, hmmm, govt scares me 2
111151	@eddierowan6 Eddie do you not think that if there was a credible vaccine for Covid19 they would have used this? It‚Äôs not the fact they don‚Äôt want us well they want to stop the people from dying.
201836	I‚Äôm finally COVID-19 vaccinated and so much weight has been lifted from my entire being. For those who are iffy about the vaccine, my side effects (chills and soreness) really was just 1-2 days. I will take that over the virus ANYDAY üòá‚úåüèº
112619	In my opinion, the miniscule covid virulence for this age group does not warrant any new unknown risks from a vaccine. Especially if we are reaching herd immunity levels.These efforts are better spent on assisting 3rd world countries with their vaccination strategy.
107826	"Folks.Invermectin is an anti-parasitic. Prescribed to battle parasites. Thus the ""anti,"" then ""parasitic.""COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, is a virus. Right in the name. Again.Antiparasitics are not indicated in the treatment of viruses. Targeted vaccines? Are."
111923	Just stop with the Bullshit, Covid doesn't fn exist, until you get the vaccine that isn't a vaccine.... besides that, how tf do you know you have something that THERE NO VALID TEST FOR?! FK THIS DUMB ASS WORLD!
112248	@KindeandTrue In Dec 2019, Moderna/NIAID signed a contract with Ralph Baric to research mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates by performing ‚Äúchallenge studies‚Äù in humanised mice.Any legitimate government would‚Äôve made everything around this research public after 2 years into this ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù.
110732	The issue is that all USA federal employees, including army personnel, are required to have the covid-19 vaccine. People who would get it have already gotten it. People who wouldn‚Äôt get it just wont get it. I would be surprised if someone changed their mind on the vaccine for 50k
202254	I read about this last week. I would prefer Moderna for a booster, if it is available when my turn comes.My first shot was Pfizer: slept almost the whole of the next day but no other effects. Moderna... I woke the next day and it felt like someone had amputated my arm lol.
111909	Are vaccines helping? Do they assist humans or mutation?Seriously, who knows if they are better than the human immune system?Perhaps they are able to minimize the impact of the viruses effect?
109582	@Loyd71460097 The COVID vaccine‚Äôs goal is to protect us from coronavirus. How is a simple vaccine injection meant to demoralise individuals and segregate them, based off what? What is this New World Order you refer to? It sounds a lot like the Thousand Year Reich to me, I‚Äôm just curious.
112500	is this the vaccine approved by trump and pence?i can't take my chances when i'm dead, so i'll stay alive.thanx anyway, tho.
111247	When the @JoeBiden administration has shipped any #COVID19 vaccines, then and ONLY then will I get one. #NoTrumpVaccine4Me
111192	A woman in Dallas has tested positive twice now for virus this proves that we can be infected again after antibodies leave our system this changes everything that we hoped for it makes trumps arguments irrelevant this will not magically leave us until we get a vaccine
110085	And how did Canada Pension get this past Trudeau‚Äôs environmental watch dogs?Trudeau doesn‚Äôt invest in the West.That became abundantly clear when an Alberta company developed a viable mRNA #COVID19 vaccine and Trudeau wouldn‚Äôt invest in it. Now the US is.#TrudeauWorsePMEver

110818	@GovKathyHochul 1. You fired healthcare workers for no good reason 2. Masks don‚Äôt work 3. Vaccines don‚Äôt make you immune to contracting or spreading Covid-19
111418	@CelticAnarchy It's an interesting question! But it would need to be an antiviral that's1. Effective at removing most strains of coronavirus, it can't be retooled every year like a vaccine2. Have side effects mild enough for OTC usage, not likely because antivirals are rarely mild on the body
112495	this is why ppl that are like ‚Äúhow did they come up with the vaccine so fast??‚Äù don‚Äôt make any sense bc it has literally BEEN HERE for YEARS.
201902	V much looking forward to my Fauci Ouchie, aka my Tureci Caress-y, my Sahin Vaccine, my Zaks Relax (if we want to honor the scientists who developed them).
112825	"@SBSNews Uuuh what ""natural immunity"" for people who've had COVID19. You can get it more than once. This is one of the main reasons why a high efficacy vaccine is  paramountüò≥ It's not good enough to pitch ""eat what you're given or go without"". We're paying for this. Use tax money wisely"
110912	If somebody discovers a vaccine for the Coronavirus, it will be interesting to see how many people refuse it.
112068	I read there has never been a vaccine for any coronavirus. True? Yet they are gonna bang one out for COVID-19 in 9 months? Money would have nothing to do with that, would it? I mean a vaccine for the common cold would cripple the OTC drug companies. Right?
112766	@ArcticTartan @PamBucci @Craig_A_Spencer Just like with the vaccine, is it still possible for a person with ‚Äòimmunity‚Äô to transmit the novel coronavirus? Even after receiving the vaccine, people are being advised to continue to follow all the COVID-19 precautions. There‚Äôs still a lot to learn about SARS-CoV-2.
112413	I missed the 500 last year. I won't miss it this year. I would drive down to @IMS to get my vaccine just for the experience.
112723	Get him out if that bed! He didn‚Äôt want a vaccine he doesn‚Äôt need to take up space for medical attention he doesn‚Äôt believe in!!!
202336	@raja_1980 @chetanmudrabett @BBMPAdmn @BBMPSWMSplComm @BBMPCOMM @BbmpsplHealth @BBMPSouthZone Those who have already taken the first dose of #COVID19 vaccine should be given an online box to tick - I am willing to take the second dose earlier at 6 wks.

108056	@buttonbox21 @frederickone Only way we are going to get rid of COVID-19 for good is a vaccine, it is not rocket science, otherwise year after year it is going to keep coming back and we will be in lockdown after lockdown of the lockdown and people like you will be responsible.

111604	Listen to elected officials who believe in science (like @GovEvers and @POTUS). The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and the best way to get our state back to normal. Have you gotten your vaccine yet?
201962	How safe is covid vaccine. #CovidVaccine asking for my 60y old mother.We want her to get vaccinated but She is scared as 2 ppl fell ill and one died after first dose post catching #COVID19 @GabbbarSingh @AndColorPockeT
109025	This is actually normal but I cant lie and say I'm not apprehensive about a vaccine that has been so quick to be developed. Im basically considering this still a clinical trial. Thats why I'm not upset at any FDA regs.
110559	Tripe, it will depend on how efficient the SNP Government is in organising the vaccine roll-out and we all know they don't have a good record on being efficient. ü§î
108151	Have gotten flu vaccine every year forever. Have never had influenza. I‚Äôll get flu vaccine again this year. Will not take a Covid19 vaccine
110906	Let me tell everyone something to sum up this #coronavirus story.What happened to us was all a lie, there is no pandemic,everyone better find a way to convince themselves before it‚Äôs too late!They will try to inject you with something that‚Äôs not a vaccine!I‚Äôm not joking #Covid_19
110478	@NickFavorito @cbrew1789 @johnrobertsFox How is it Russian roulette if you already have existing natural immunity from previous COVID-19 infection?! I am not saying people who haven‚Äôt been infected have immunity. But +34 million are confirmed to have had COVID-19 . THEY are immune. THEY do not need a vaccine.
110653	@zerohedge We kinda need a vaccine first... bearing in mind that humans have never invented a vaccine for any coronavirus, ever...

111166	@SPWTalessia @realDonaldTrump Can you give me more reasoning as to why mail-in ballots won't work amidst the coronavirus pandemic that has no vaccine as of yet? I'd like to respectfully discuss this with you.
108530	I keep seeing headlines about someone catching COVID-19 after getting the vaccine, except they only got one of two doses, so is this really even news?
110764	.@NBCNews do better. it is a known fact that the vaccine isn't suppose to prevent you from getting the virus. it stimulates our immune system to make antibodies to fight against the virus. your misleading headline is potentially harmful to others. @TwitterSupport
110357	@thesamsorbo I‚Äôm not doing the vaccine. I‚Äôve done the flu vaccine before but it made me so sick &amp; they always say ‚Äúoh it wasn‚Äôt the right strain for this year‚Äù Now they are saying due to other variations of the coronavirus this vaccine may not be as effective as we first thot.

111416	Vaccine apparently to be rolled out next week, hopefully we can get back to normal soon. Still loads of people saying its going to connect us to the matrix like üòÇ

110236	Hey #Conservatives, unless you have a specific and documents reason to not get the #covid19 #vaccine, I have no issues ‚Äúdiscriminating‚Äù against you because frankly you are less valuable of a human being in my eyes. Get over yourselves already!
111498	Providing the coronavirus vaccine via private healthcare is an immediate moral thing to do. Private sector will find their own ways to source it and won‚Äôt use the NHS supplies. I for one will NOT take it at an NHS facility and will wait for private healthcare, and pay for it
111567	@mcallcott @jerrythegooner I AM a qualified MD. If you have to booster yourself every 6 months, or so, then it‚Äôs like getting the common cold. BTW, the common cold IS A CORONAVIRUS. There is NO CURE for the common cold because IT‚ÄôS CONSTANTLY MUTATING ! HELLO !!
108640	@Reuters Just now GOD/ALLAH/SHIV has suggested one mentioned below vaccine for this Coronavirus ---------  Don't visit any Church, Mosque &amp; Temple...until you permanently QUIT Smoking, Alcohol, Drug, PORN, Premarital Sex/Extramarital affairs.
108999	People who are. Taking their kids for COVID vaccine trails may be they don‚Äôt love their children , children‚Äôs immune system is far more strong naturally
110941	With all these photos of leaders and politicians getting the COVID19 vaccine injection, I haven't seen any doctors, nurses or any frontline workers getting theirs.Is there a chance they know something we don't...
112190	@slava_pestov It‚Äôs not quite so simple.  A vaccine for coronavirus is not likely to be as effective as other vaccines.It won‚Äôt necessarily induce total immunity or complete protection.  And capitalism will impede distribution.Masking and social distancing will be with us for a few years.
110599	@CBSNews Fact - Vaccinated individuals can still get Covid-19 and spread it. The vaccine only lessons the symptoms if you get it and does NOT prevent you from getting it! This is ridiculous!
108908	Really so someone has a cold and we are all going to die again. Wake up love .its all a lie .covid19 is a virus but not a deadly virus we are being told .its all about the vaccine
111172	An intensivists thread on communicating how vaccines work‚Ä¶I‚Äôve used the following analogy for a while now.#COVID19 Think of your immune system as a police force, or better, a group of police forces like Interpol in Europe1/n
110230	@Skitty_Bard @crownarmourer @Reuters @Holbornlolz UK normally has a vaccine damage payment of ¬£120k, tax-free. But like I say, if you want to be a guinea pig, go ahead. I wouldn't touch it with a bargepole - assuming, of course, they get one (it'll be a first for a coronavirus if they do).
109036	The yearly Flu is not owned by the Democrats but COVID-19 is their baby they paid for it and turned it loose . And apparently they had a vaccine before they released it . No top Democrat/Communist has contacted the virus ü§î
109540	Looks like the Moderna vaccine that the US gov spent $2.5bn dollars on won't be tested/safe and they're going to overrule the FDA and distribute it anyway

109813	@RT_com They're running an intro sale as we speak. Buy one coronavirus vaccine and get an HPV for free!
111410	By what they are saying on the news, the residents and workers in care homes have already been bumped down. Due to the fact the hospitals are the only ones so far that can store the vaccines in their 70 below fridges. ü§∑#Alzheimers üíú #Carers üíú
112121	Appreciable gesture,it is how human is different than Virus.It will help in big way when Vaccine is only protection against pandemic but with limited availability.
110955	While everyone's been at home they've been setting up the 5G 60 gigahertz Milla waves and once they turn it on many millions of people will become very sick with covid-19 symptoms and then they will lock down the world again and push the vaccine on everybody
202446	My parents got their blue envelopes today with their #Covid19 #vaccine appointments. Had a wee lump in my throat when I heard. Not sure if it was relief, happiness, fear, anxiety or hope ... but an emotion nonetheless. We're getting there people! Slowly but surely üëçü§û

108627	I've asked this question before. Will the BLUE back YOU or will they enforce unconstitutional/unlawful vaccine mandates?. Here's the answer ‚¨áÔ∏è
112120	This is the right call, and they've also announced it before most people have started their training. Here's hoping we get a vaccine and can do all our gatherings in 2021.
111339	@seanhannity One of the better idea's the court had. Now if only they could force Covid-19 death certificates to have an accompanying lab report identifying that specific coronavirus among all those in existence we might get past lock down! China was working on a vaccine, the virus existed

112433	They approved a vaccine that didn't went through clinical trials and they're willing to give it to us for free, saying it's safe and it's about to be mass produced,, we're the clinical trial aren't we? Fucking hell.
202121	Guidelines for persons who have gotten 'FULLY' vaccinated against #COVID19 .Fully = 2 weeks after the SECOND dose of a #CovidVaccine. I see people in #lka #SriLanka wandering around like no tomorrow with a single dose or nothing at all!
112824	@BretWeinstein  UCSF has informed their staff (my BF included) that the Covid-19 vaccine is mandatory for all staff starting July 15th. It's part of the UC system but it's a bit sticky as they're a partner. My BF is well read on the research and doesn't want the vaccine.
109061	"okay then. but to say that ""flexible learning"" is here to stay is like saying that CHED won't be exploring the chances of having limited f2f classes. vaccine roll-out is already accelerating. certainly, students and faculties have their utmost expectation to go back to f2f class."
111738	@weartv No sympathy here.  Heard and read enough of these stories already.  It is people right to sign their death certificate if they don‚Äôt get the COVID-19 vaccine or #WearAMask. Do the right thing for the U.S.‚Äî#WashYourHands #SaveYourself #GetVaccinated
111866	@NotABot42519864 @DK97682998 @ryanstruyk @realDonaldTrump It will never be zero unless a vaccine is discovered and widely applied. Antivaxxers won't take it so novel coronavirus will be with us forever. Stop spreading false info about this disease.

110990	@Dalal415182053 @thehill The vaccine leaves a 5% possibility of getting COVID19.  Every person who is vaccinated is NOT going to get COVID19 just because there is a possibility.  Again, give me the statistics that out of all the people vaccinated, how many have gotten it.
108077	"Why? Because the ""vaccine"" does NOT, must I repeat NOT, immunize you against the virus. Vaccines inoculate. This is NOT a vaccine."
109043	@doodleslave You can't get Covid19 frimi a vaccine. There is no way. This is just a reaction to mrna in the vaccine. Your immune system is reacting as it should.
109391	the racism happening is inexcusable, however more people are worried about the coronavirus because it's new, there's no vaccine, and it spread to the u.s real quick. the flu vaccine isnt 100% effective and not everyone has access to vaccines üôÉ
111117	And to make matters worse,they are saying this variant may be very resistant to the current vaccines. It‚Äôs traced back to an African country after someone‚Äôs travel there.Just when we thought we‚Äôd get a break!ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
109186	If a vaccine was developed for the coronavirus I wonder how many anti vaxxers would be getting first in line to get a shot! ü§î
108717	Am all for a #vaccination  for #COVID19  absolutely but I also don‚Äôt think this vaccine has been tested long enough for future effects.  But i do think if @BorisJohnson is putting laws out there saying don‚Äôt have it you don‚Äôt work or holiday. I think he should start the trend
110580	Please explain to me why people like McConnell and Trump get the first doses of the vaccine when 1) they said it was a hoax 2) get the best covid treatments that no one else gets 3) they don‚Äôt wear masks 4) they didn‚Äôt buy enough doses for everyone
109408	@realLizUSA If I remember correctly from what I read about the research done on the coronavirus an easy peasy explaination would be we had a working vaccine for SARS 1 &amp; MERS they just tweaked it for SARS 2. Wouldn't take 5 yrs w/ the technology we have today.
110282	@Techsports8 @MaxWinebach Just stop. You‚Äôve lost all credibility. Oh, the earth is not flat, vaccines are a good thing, coronavirus is not a hoax, masks help.
110370	@CathyMohlahlana @mamaboitumelo They must do what they feel is best 4 their kids. Its each man 4 himself now government is tired whatever they try someone will complain. Truth is the only perfect time to open schools is when we hv a cure or vaccine 4 coronavirus
111395	What comfort is there for anyone in LTC care or their family that any worker taking one week education on Covid19 or having a medical exemption ( WTHISTHAT) can keep them safe ? What ? Get the vaccine. If your fear of the vaccine lets you make others deadly sick, get a diff job.
108202	This is why we can't have nice things in this country -- B/C there is far too large a portion of our population who refuses to take a safe, effective, free vaccine, but who will gladly ingest livestock dewormer...
109177	@toleafoa_ I read an article about how they wouldn‚Äôt guarantee a coronavirus vaccine to be affordable for everyone because they need the private sector to invest.

112659	Good. You shouldn‚Äôt be working in the food industry if you‚Äôre refusing a vaccine during a global pandemic. Can we please stop being stupid for 1 day
112256	@IanLaveryMP The objective was to flatten the curve.Anyone who believes that you can stop viruses without a vaccine is insane it will distroy everything else if you try.There is no vaccine for SARS CoV1 2003 MERS CoV or coronavirus that cause 30% of Colds.Stop living so that you don't die!
111597	we need to find  a cure we need the virus erradicated vaccines dont do this why are scientists not finding source and cure ? @CDCemergency
110413	Clarification that‚Äôs not 100% true, the flu vaccine is made using different techniques and not an mRNA vaccine. There are currently 3 different ways influenza vaccines are generated. The Covid vaccine is first mRNA vaccine but that technology has been in development for 30yrs.

111296	The side show is coming &amp; we hope there's not one news agency that falls for it. Trump getting a vaccine on TV? Oh please, supposedly he had covid, although it could have been re-election ploy, for all we know, its saline. means absolutely nothing, NOTHING! He has no transparency
109121	Madagascar made a coronavirus medication, the world rejected it because it is from Africa. The West made a vaccine, we are forced to take it without questioning it, WHY? By the way Madagascar only has 42,800 cases &amp; 958 deaths, way lower compared to countries taking the jab
109084	If we're not going to EUA the AstraZeneca vaccine now we really should export it. After about the next month we're not going to need it.

It‚Äôs kinda crazy seeing how much Covid has killed in just 6 months in comparison to the flu so far. :/
107912	We have to be so grateful for the vaccine...instead anti vaccine Americans are refusing them..medics have to trash the xtra vaccines while some counties don't have enough The press is not reporting the atrocious vaccine trashing.shameful

BRICS is not for the needy
108992	As the looney left tries to force vaccine mandates, the makers of the vaccines are now admitting the vaccines don‚Äôt work.  If they did work, they would not be suggesting boosters two months after vaccination.  Wake up, sheeple!

111680	Why do all these conservative Republican @gop suddenly want the first Covid-19 vaccines?? Don‚Äôt they keep saying it‚Äôs a fake virus?? Were they lying?
110087	Another angle to consider - the first vaccine w/ an EUA will enjoy an unprecedented infusion of public-private funding + manufacturing. There are incredible resources primed to go. We don‚Äôt don‚Äôt want to unleash these resources on what turns out to be the ‚Äúleast good‚Äù vaccine.
111051	@PolitiBunny @DeAngelisCorey My daughters are RNs and caught COVID19 while serving on the front lines during the pandemic. They are barely allowed to work because they refused the jab. They are already immune!

110967	When you see so many #COVIDIOTS out and about, getting too close in shops etc, I do think once we've all been offered the vaccine, we just let it rip. It will kill some of the idiots and many will get long #COVID19 but as least we can all just get on with our lives.@BBCNews
108904	Question for those that know: if Biotech updated their mRNA vaccine to target the Delta variant instead of the original version, will they need to do trials again or can they go straight to the market? #Pfizervaccine #coronavirus
111484	@derekobrienmp We know @MamataOfficial is very much concerned about Covid-19 situation but sir, it's an SOS, please place the order for the vaccine for everyone in the state, whatever the cost may be. Please do not go for another tug of war with centre. Everything can wait.

112268	What is happening in Melbourne will happen in Canada - before long.There is no truth or clarity of thought.*80% of Canadians are fully vaccinated.They are rejoicing. They say the vaccines work. But angry at the unvaccinated. They think they will get Covid19 from the unvaxxed?
112890	@TweetTruth2Me_ Same. I‚Äôm worried the v is going to destroy their immune system and they are going to have to rely on a ‚Äúbooster‚Äù for coronavirus and flu for the rest of their lives. Imagine tge control they will have on people when they rely on the government to live. In comes digtal passports
109434	@GovWhitmer Why is taking so long with covid19 vaccine what's going on why everything is slowing down now . ?
109987	@Evar_Galois @strauss_matt Dying from Covid-19 or any reason is never good news. It is very sad, but is  just part of the reality in pandemics like this. We can't do much to avoid it, if we have no vaccines. In case of this virus, we didn't until now. Better times are ahead.
109218	@MarkHubbard33 @Mihi_Forbes Further  the spike protein in Covid-19 vaccines is genetically modified to enhance the immune response and to stop it binding to cell receptors in the same way the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein would. Hope this clears things up
112627	@jonathanec12 @ScottGottliebMD It's saying that we won't get herd immunity from the vaccine but if we get COVID-19 it will be less likely to kill us. What do you think it says?
111381	@elemental @ASlavitt Where are those immunologist who understands that this coronavirus attacks humans who have an unhealthy body metabolism and pH factorsWithout a vaccine immunology and immunotherapy are the only way to combat this virus.It's an RNA protein has a fatal attraction for malnutrition
108708	Could someone please ask Dr. Fauci why a vaccine will confer immunity that actually contracting the coronavirus doesn‚Äôt? #COVID19
108244	So what happens is FDA only approved Pfizer and not moderna. How does everyone get boosters if they originally got moderna or JJ shot? Your not suppose to missmatch the vaccines. I think this is a important question to figure out before mandating  vaccines. #FDA #VACCINE #COVID19
110959	It's GOT to be this way.We've got to save our country.If we have to fire people to do it, so be it.They need to simply get the vaccine.I don't feel sorry for them.It's their choice. üë†
109182	I'm going to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but I'm so worried. It's hard to know what the right answer is because there is so much information about the risks and safety.
112883	There is a certain irony between how the vaccine is being managed in contrast to the virus itself. #COVID19

All the vaccines are trash that is why influenza is so heavily monitored or was until Covid-19 became popular. The only risk is the persons age or current condition before infection.
108956	@NotReallyIrish @realistgeo @EconomicsTeach5 @BBCr4today @BBCNews Nope, it's capitalism. But what loads of people tweeting about this want to believe is that there is an unholy Bill Gates-led Covid-19 plot to control everyone through a gene-splicing vaccine. It won't be rushed out on Gates' say so. And there isn't one anywhere near ready.

110210	The problem is with COVID-19 and other pending pandemics, we need to monitor who is coming in to America because some could be sick and NOT all Americans believe in vaccines, so it is a national security issue. And yet they want to lock Americans and their businesses down.
112508	With uncontrolled spread in various places (including India) there is a risk of a new vaccine resistant variant springing up.So the studies that say I'm safe from the standard variants are not good enough when I don't know the travel history of the person on my sidewalk.

112776	So now Covid-19 vaccines will be ready for the first Americans in 3 weeks?? Yea I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm getting it any time soon, somehow every company is just getting faster and faster
201898	@MoHFW_INDIA @CovidIndiaSeva @PMCPuneI am a healthcare worker. I got my first dose on 6th March at Kamala Nehru Hospital, Pune. My name in the covid certificate has gone wrong. How can I change it?? Is there any process to do the same??#COVID19 #CovidVaccine #Pune
111961	Hah!? So, doesn't that assertion begs the question: So what good is the vaccine? An answer: It's time we perform the ages old haruspex on such sacrificial animals.
110061	@RepublicanSwine Marcus Lamb, founder of the large Christian network Daystar, died after contracting the coronavirus. Lamb's network during the pandemic has made the virus a huge focus, calling it a satanic attack that should not be treated with vaccines.
109720	It‚Äôs tiring listening to these high sounding nothing speeches on ‚Äúvaccine inequality‚Äù. The world is unequal do you miraculously expect COVID-19 pandemic to fix cleavages of  inequality ? ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The pandemic is accentuating our reality. Let‚Äôs keep it going stop pretending you care üôè
112312	This Covid-19 vaccine shouldn‚Äôt be the people‚Äôs vaccine, it is a vaccine for those affected with the corona virus ü¶†. Not even 1% of the world was affected, the covid 19 isn‚Äôt biological developed by the human body, why should it then be termed a vaccine for all?
108871	@notinphilly69 @washingtonpost do you know how vaccines work? There are decades of research on how vaccines work. Coronavirus are NOT new, THIS strain IS. The more you know!
112320	@robert_weiter @shootingsteady @kmoxnews @kmoxmaria @senatemajldr @VP @CBSNews Just to let you know, COVID-19 isn't going away without a vaccine. Even if everyone stayed home and never saw another human being for 3 months. It will always come back as soon as schools open and businesses reopen.
109964	Logic tells me:If ppl can choose the vaccine they want = there will be a less popular vaccine = vaccine wastage Wastage of vaccine = wasting tax payers' money...unless we have Toyota inventory management techniques.
107942	"@ArvindKejriwal I have already gone through a Covid-19 Phase in my life recently.""Is there any need for me to take that vaccine??"""
109746	@BrianH618 I think it‚Äôs an absolute terrible idea. No way to even know if Covid-19 is better or worse in the spring. Also, even with vaccine, no guarantee fans, players or coaches will take it. One study said 2 out of 5 individuals surveyed said they would not take a vaccine.
109851	I guess I'm curious as to why this is question with ONLY THIS vaccine. Why not MMR or dTap when we had a whooping cough or mumps outbreak in recent years? Those are easily transmitted, too. #VaccinePassports #vaccination
107685	@jablamsky @JoTrader4 @GrowthStockDoc I added a lot to $DKNG in the 42s - after already having a decent size. Love this one for long term. They're looking great.Every bad covid-19 news might bring it down, but pro sports are still happening - The 2020-21 NBA season will begin on Dec. 22 and NHL will start Jan 1st.
108005	@btckershi @btcbraj @ZLOK @MrHodl @maxtannahill i've had numerous coronavirus infections. i expect the vaccine will not prevent you getting another one. i think that is the opinion of medical people these days also. immunity is not a binary, thus the certificate is a fraud.
108666	My question is this, The vaccine remains the same and yet the virus keeps mutating. How would a booster help if it is the same vaccine I took originally? Hope someone has an answer.
112832	I would say it‚Äôs a positive step that pregnant women are now being offered the vaccine &amp; can make an informed decision about whether or not to receive it. Some won‚Äôt be able to get it, others will decide not to but the key word is choice. 1 in 2 is not a bad uptake so far either.

110224	@Shubham_Neuro @sciphi_Ananya @WHO @BharatBiotech I think Covaxin is the best COVID-19 vaccine available in the world today. It‚Äôs the traditional vaccine made from inactivated virus. All other vaccines are either mRNA or DNA based vaccines and we have no clue what are the long term side effects going to be?

109311	@acidcigarfan @Tactical_review How long do you think coronavirus vaccine research has been around? It all began in 2002 with SARS and then continued with MERS in 2013. That‚Äôs a big reason it came out so fast https://t.co/axATzId7Rz
108739	If there's any sentiment for giving Trump credit for the COVID vaccine, this has to be the second sentence in the statement.
111555	In case you find this confusing, or think they don't know what they're talking about/doing, THE CDC HAS LOWERED THE NUMBER OF DAYS TO QUARANTINE FOR THE SAME REASON THE VACCINE IS FREE:üí•CAPITALISMüí• They need us at work to keep the economy running &amp; the top 1% earning!
110904	Should #Guatemala (and other countries) have to close their borders, it creates an interesting dilemma for those who chose to go abroad for their #covid19 vaccines. Because the country is one-two months behind them, so when they need a booster shot there could be lag.
111706	So crucial for EVERYONE to get vaccinated. We've eradicated a slew of deadly diseases in this country this way. These vaccines work. PLEASE. Just do it. We will never truly be done with Covid-19 at this point, it's just too late, but we can regain our freedom and security.
111302	@SnypLuciano @YouTube Yep but this is what we are dealing with on the left. This is why they are pushing for a vaccine and lying to the ppl that it is a vaccine for covid19. They are evil incarnate and have been planning this for decades.
111050	@latimes yes this is true, i've shared meeting minutes from 2019 -conversations about coronavirus. how deadly it'll be - how it will spread - and which pharma will make the tests and vaccine. True - but no-one listens to me because they've meen hated too. BUT I been warning since AIDS hit
110870	..This will go on, Mandates on masks first, mandates on the covid19 vaccine to attend school are already in place in some states for instance my own, now do we want to talk about a cashless society too?
108526	You know I haven't seen this answered in the news. Are we going to have a #COVID19 vaccine shot every year just like the flu?
202228	How did I ring in the New Year???... oh you know, vaccinated about 45 first responders... and a couple of my School Nurse friends/colleagues.. and, got my first Covid-19 vaccine! https://t.co/X8zBLxXQrx
111374	@PhilOSo86839856 @RealJamieKay No I can't. However I know my husband  who also caught it and my GP know.  I stated a fact. I couldn't care less if you believe me or not but the fact is, you can spread Covid-19 even if you are double vaxed, my immunity will last a year, your vaccine will need 2 boosters a year.
112360	The gap between countries who can &amp; can‚Äôt afford vaccines is growing every day. Vaccinating everyone, everywhere is our only way to be free from the #COVID19 pandemic. Tune in now for this once-in generation festival.
111161	@PhRMA Decades of research that have never produced a viable vaccine for a coronavirus.  Thanks, but no thanks.  I‚Äôll take my chances.
111673	Great news to wake up to this morning. Britain has authorized the first COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, making it the first country in the world to do so. The U.S. and others likely won't be far behind.

110841	So maybe don't take the vaccines if you have diabetes or a peanut allergy or are female or whatever's on next in the Great Warped Speed Fiasco.
108664	Malone contracted COVID-19 in February 2020, and later got the Moderna vaccine in hopes that it would alleviate his long-haul symptoms. It is people like her we will never get over this virus.
111025	@Newsweek Does anyone really know how effective this vaccine is will it last 30 days 6 months or even 1 year in your immune system will you actually not get the coronavirus
111405	How is this not going SUPER viral?They just admitted vaccines are worthless. @benshapiro Unpack this please
107901	#COVID19 I will not be surprised if we have been told to take the vaccine 3 times a year, yep ones every 4 months. taking something that is so useless against any mutation.
202378	I‚Äôve even considered getting a pneumonia vaccine. But I‚Äôm going to talk to my doctor first. I‚Äôve had pneumonia more than most people in my life (last one was about 14 years ago). So I‚Äôm considering it anyway. TBD. Gonna talk to my doctor first.
109800	While we're on the topic of fat-phobia, who can tell me if fat people were included in any of the wildly successful COVID-19 vaccine trials? Cuz what you're NOT gonna do is give us a vaccine that's only made for thin people. (yes, there are precedents - like Plan B)

110618	@CDCgov What I have to inquire about is not the testing. I‚Äôve heard pneumonia is what actually makes everyone so sick with covid19. If that is true why can‚Äôt potential victims of the virus get the pneumonia vaccine? I have COPD and no pneumonia since taking that vaccine.
108123	There are certain problems with the Sputnik-V vaccine (this is the one being administered in the private sector). Details mentioned below:
112923	Just a reminder, the rest of the  world is working together on developing a vaccine against #covid19 and the US is not included because they don‚Äôt trust Trump.
107889	"This person thinks Anthony Fauci holds a patent to the Covid-19 vaccine, and is withholding for ""reasons""Their opinion on anything, from the price of tea in China, to the solution to 2+2 is invalid.If they get something right, it's by happy accident, the brainworms ate the rest"
108418	@DavidBe53174057 Lower respiratory instead of upper respiratory.Causes deadly to humans immune responses, mini blood clots in internal organs,blood thickening resulting in organ failure.May trigger body's immune system to attack brain cells. No vaccine for any coronavirus.

201994	Got my #flujab todayOne of the joys of being immunosuppressed.Hopefully the next jab will be the #COVID19 vacine
108701	One problem with this plan is that the Indian Serum Institute (like our FDA) hasn‚Äôt issued an EUA for any of the COVID-19 vaccines manufactured in the U.S., so none can be administered there yet. The SII has approved Covidshield, based on the AZ vaccine, but not quite the same.
109849	‚ÄúVaccines for the coronavirus is a frustrating subject. It could take a year, or 18 months to develop a successful vaccine for #COVID19. Most importantly, we want to creat a vaccine which can actually worked‚Äù
107712	@FEDERMCF @FaheemYounus Exactly thatviscwhatcI am saying.I am unstupid enough to know facts such as...Vaccines have ingredients highly dangerous for the nervous system such as formaldehyde etc. Do you even know what is in your vaccine?Do you know Bill Gates owns the pattern for Covid19 (Phirbright)?
111520	@EWoodhouse7 And THIS is why no one has been able to develop an effective coronavirus vaccine in decades!  Masks don‚Äôt work- vax doesn‚Äôt protect.  Let‚Äôs go back to the main truth- virus is gonna virus
111968	No vaccine for HIV after 40 years of research.No vaccine for the common cold.ÔøºNo vaccine for cancer after 100 years of research. A virus mysteriously appears and within a year a vaccine is created and we are all expected to take it.Not. Happening! #COVID19
110857	Okay normally this would be funny but this is just going lead to more not taking the vaccine and the longer we going have to deal with the pandemic.
109441	February 25: ‚ÄúCDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.‚Äù  February 25: ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a problem that‚Äôs going to go away‚Ä¶ They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we‚Äôre very close to a Vaccine.‚Äù??
109645	So informative and interesting. Take any vaccine your offered, they are all effective and will help to protect against #COVID19
110253	@HeidiWhitaker @POTUS What will they do. Arrest you if you don‚Äôt? They let dangerous criminals OUT of prisons to protect them from #COVID19 yet they will jail someone for not allowing a forced vaccine?
110469	Why did we go for the cheap and less effective one? Why didn‚Äôt we go for the Phizer vaccine?Australia isn‚Äôt a poor country. But LNP members have stocks in Astra Zeneca so I guess their finances are more important that Australians, right Scomo?#auspol #ScottyFromPhotoOps
108250	lol there it is, the deal with modernathe company who has never made a vaccine before yet is charging the highest price for a CV19 vaccine, all while insiders dump stock at unprecedented levels on the heels of their vaccine news driving up it's price
109900	I have heard this same message 100s of times and my stance on taking the vaccine hasn't changed but now my football team says it that's totally going to change my opinion

109153	Accept this fact that historically it took avenge 11 years 2develop a vaccine. Secondly gene based technology is new with no proven history so it should take more time then normal technology. Otherwise vaccines will take more life‚Äôs then #coronavirus @NileshShah68 @VijayKedia1

112275	@TeemoCarry @KeenwaAcai @DrEricDing They have clearly said they aren't injecting part of the virus like they have done in the past that can cause these reactions. You're assuming things with no proof. I rather have the vaccine with its very low chance of side effect to getting the Coronavirus with no vaccine
110830	@GorillaSIX @uk_domain_names as in there is no approved vaccine yet...Not for SARS1, not for MERS and not for RSV...all 3 are coronaviruses that we have lived for a long time already...all 3 can cause pneumonia...and neither of them a vaccine...so COVID19 is treated like a VIP
111578	@newsmax I know people who don't agree with getting the COVID-19 vaccine, but the politics they like &amp; listen to are saying we need to get a COVID-19 vaccine. And so those people are now saying we need to get a COVID-19 vaccine just because the politics they like &amp; listen to are saying it

112671	@JohnEJefferson the world has not developed a vaccine for aids why do governements say a vaccine for #coronavirus will be available in 2021
108612	This legit sounds like satire.Imagine being this stubborn about taking a vaccine when you‚Äôre the face of a franchise. Kirk Cousins is showing horrible leadership &amp; judgement; just take the damn vaccine like you did for the measles &amp; chicken pox when you were a kid dumb ass.
112341	I honestly had no bad reaction to the vaccine and I got it while pregnant and my baby is healthy and growing fine. It‚Äôs a choice to get it and I don‚Äôt judge people who don‚Äôt so don‚Äôt judge others who do get it.
107925	Why the hell all this vaccine hype, when there is a 100% cure if you catch the flu? Sorry Bill I aint buying your arm poison. @21WIRE The pcr test is also a scam!

110842	@Arshathz your POV on this would be appreciated. Kindly enlighten us on how far is this going to be safe &amp; effective over an mRNA vaccine for their second dose? Are there clinical efficacy data for mixing and matching vaccines, such as clinical trials or real-world studies? #lka

111084	Oh fabulous,Now the government is pledging our tax dollars to promote a vaccine that is non existent, ineffective for viruses, and probably fatal to kids to nations they think need our help.A little presumptuous, racist, a little demeaning, obnoxious, perhaps @ScottMorrisonMP?
108643	Okay y'all, really? We are going to hoard covid vaccines? This is the moment we all help each other!! THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU RESTORE FAITH IN HUMANITY. Not the moment where you capitalize on this vaccine, over people's lives!!! Just stop, stop, and be human.
109617	@MediaSequitur know the WHO is complicit in this. If you listen and watch the videos very carefully (watch them a few times) what you will notice is that it is an admission that the oral polio vaccine doesn‚Äôt work, causes paralysis, and yet they are advertising it anyway. So a COVID19 vaccine
110590	@Intuitive1966 Im curious to know how the vaccinated get on when they catch the actual virus . Will it be fine or create the cytokine storm coronavirus vaccines are known for !

111158	@TrueLoserCorp66 @Tama_Rama_SR ‚Ä¶&amp; of course, that is impossible, which is why there have NEVER been effective vaccines for any coronavirus. Including, I believe, a common cold. So.

110742	I became suspicious when my own research back in Feb-March told me- boost your immune-system to fight it off if you get it. Then gradually I noticed the media said nothing re.that &amp; big tech was censoring .Why? B/c they  want you to take the fucking vaccine, not be healthy.

202413	Day 380437 of being asked if I‚Äôd ‚Äòlike to add a Covid-19 vaccine frame‚Äô to my fb profile picture. It‚Äôs still very much a no.
109317	@FOOL_NELSON HOW do we know that? All the people who had coronavirus vaccine years ago don't have spike protein anymore? Am I confused? Are you confused? It's probably me.üòÅ
110291	This sounds like unpopular opinion but what is so bad about taking the vaccine. Yeah I know it's untested but coronavirus isn't this imaginary disease. What else do you want them to do, wait 10 years to Test it....? We are in midst of worst global pandemic since the Spanish Flu.
112837	".. People1st need to understand what a vaccine is.U cant &amp; Shouldnt ""INDUCE"" HIV  COVID19 Virus in a human's blood to Make th human being 'IMMUNE' to these viruses. What u'd b doing is make th human get INFECTED with these diseases. These viruses eventually grow in RedBloodCells"
107771	It's almost like letting viruses become endemic is a bad idea!Seriously, though, I do hope we get a vaccine for EBV in the near future. Even if it is not causative for autoimmune conditions, it is so often at the scene of the crime that I am definitely suspicious!
111802	This may be a shock but, Mike Pence is lying! @pfizer confirmed they did not work or receive any resources from the Trump administration while working on this vaccine.
110178	Aw bless Pfizer doesn't need to spend advertising budget on this new 90% effective Coronavirus Vaccine (that we don't need) as the Media will advertise it for them free of charge. @LBC is currently dedicating whole hour to it even telling a student caller who it should go to 1st
109453	If we weren't supposed to get coronavirus, virologists never would have let it out of their lab.We don't get influenza vaccines, yeah? Did you get your flu shot? Probably not. What's next? Government mandating influenza shots? Shit's been spreading since 1919.
109699	@MarkJagielski The Chinese created this Covid-19 Virus themselves, are they too stupid enough to create an effective vaccine for it?
109726	People need to be damned patient. We've only waited 9 months for a vaccine, which is extraordinary. I've already accepted it probably won't be my turn until Summer 2021. #WearAMask  #WearADamnMask

112647	And then they'll say you have to get this little vaccine by Bill frigging Gates to keep your job.... Wake up people....
110264	"(3/5) I mean that makes no sense? Who wants to be shot up five times a month with coronavirus vaccine, and I will say it again, you don't know what kind of ""stuff"" they are putting in that vaccine, and then it goes into your body and wreaks havoc?"
108194	How COVID-19 vaccines workA visual explainer on how vaccines work, including how they work with the body‚Äôs immune system and their use in preventing coronavirus.
112703	@John33840251 Stop posting shit like this. Ppl will get scared and abandon their pets. Coronavirus is a feline/canine threat and they have vaccines for it. It is NOT the same Coronavirus as COVID19. It's a different strain. Better to delete this crap cause it's FAKE NEWS.
109386	The WHO warn that there may never be a vaccine for Coronavirus. Is Nippy going to keep Scotland shut down for ever more?
109701	This is actually genuine.Heroism requires courage by definition. Are they suggesting taking a COVID19 vaccine is dangerous? Is this an unintentional revelation?
111797	"Booster number 15?This is never gonna end.This is why mandates and waiting for ""no new cases"" is insane.It's all about power, they keep taking and taking and they'll never give those freedoms back."
112371	"@charlesmurray 2. Because after the two months of clinical trials of the vaccine, there was only a 1% difference in mortality in those who took the vaccine and those who took a placebo.  Because covid19 is 99% survivable for most people, then this 1% ""edge"" to survive covid19 is very very low."
107730	If it's due to antibodies, that's one reason, however, if this is not the case and someone could get this over and over, there goes the idea for a vaccine and the entire world is on lockdown for two years until it all goes away.
202358	Fantastic service at County Hall today. Thank you so much to all the staff who helped me get the booster/4th dose for CEV. It‚Äôs such a relief to finally get it. Everyone was so kind and helpful - what an amazing service!
111304	just heard someone (an employee) at serramonte tested positive for covid19 so good thing i‚Äôm not an idiot and going out to malls when there‚Äôs still a global pandemic with no cure or vaccine going on

109437	@boomkj @atensnut @AprilRain100 @MedCramVideos So the no lose situation is that we fear God, we don‚Äôt fear death, and we can pray that Lord willing, they develop an effective vaccine. But it‚Äôs difficult. There is no effective vaccine for the flu virus. And unfortunately we see COVID-19 changing and mutating as well...
111310	Make no mistake!As long as a covid19 vaccine isn't found in the so-called saner climes, @WHO may well not okay it! Take it or leave it.I'm not a scientist, but whatever is in those Madagascan bottles, even if it cures a million people a day, won't make sense to @WHO,
111345	@DC_Draino They‚Äôre pushing back so hard on this because they don‚Äôt want to work if there‚Äôs an effective treatment out there for COVID-19 and they can‚Äôt force out a vaccine.
109450	@MillerMattu @GOVUK @scotgov I‚Äôve no idea, but sacking healthcare staff because they won‚Äôt take one of these injections is ridiculous though, they‚Äôve been in amongst coronavirus and covid for 2 years, I‚Äôm sure their naturally acquired immunity is far better than what the vaccine offers

Oh, except there‚Äôs no justice in America. And, no vaccine for Coronavirus. And, no PPE. And, no leadership in the White House.
111234	@AllisonLCarter Most are not anti-vax. They are anti-mRNA which they don't trust the technology which has no long term studies in humans. There also has been no successful Coronavirus vaccine due to ADE or the Common Cold would have had one. These are therapeutics as you still spread the virus.
109345	@denise_dewald I would get a COVID19 vaccine in my eyeball every week if it meant we could end the pandemic
112036	@Norma09 @Just_a_fox_ The COVID-19 vaccine has no mechanism for causing the virus because it contains no virus.
110023	.@GovWhitmer just called for a vaccine that is free and safe for all. Sounds good to me, eh @uaem?#Drugprices #COVID19 #DemConvention2020
111330	@scoot3r83 Given what we already know about covid I think there is sufficient data to say the vaccines are ‚Äúrelatively safe and effective‚Äù. Far from perfect but a great tool against covid19 and it‚Äôs complications. As for mandates, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a good idea. No one should be forced.
111671	And in the wealthy countries people decline the #vaccine. They laugh in the face of covid til they are hooked up to their very own ventilator - #getyourshot
110352	Remembering in 2007 when Gov. Perry mandated a vaccine for girls to prevent HPV and realizing there is no at the wheel in the mansion these days. A goat could do this job. It would just eat any ideas places in front of it.
108381	@joimonki @lara_bolivar @nytimes I don‚Äôt remember anyone needing a polio vaccine every three months - bad comparison. Also animals do not get polio, but some do get Covid-19 -meaning we might always have an animal reservoir.

111921	US banned too. I think the whole world now. The vaccine is testing now for the new variant covid19. Results will be soon.....

111692	Ordinary developed countries strive to produce their own vaccines against coronavirus infection.However, Japanese only think about buying foreign-made vaccines.The Japanese do not consider increasing the burden on vaccine-producing countries.
108648	Indeed. These are the numbers that a longer process would cover, hence the rapidity that many feel fearful about.When my turn comes around, I‚Äôll be having the vaccine:to protect my loved ones &amp; those who cannot have this.#COVID19Vaccine Such an incredible achievement.
111043	@WideAngle_ @BreitbartNews Biden's coronavirus advisor Zeke Emanuel (Rahm's Brother) wants Biden giving out the vaccine to China and Everyone Else. While those in The US get the vaccine last it's how insane Liberals are.

109425	@BBCLBicker I wish and hope the vaccine works.  World coronavirus illness has surpassed South Korea's population.
110533	2/4  In a world with anti-vaxxer numbers rising, we desperately need to: A) make sure any COVID-19 vaccine WORKS and is SAFE; and B) convince people to TAKE it. So what does someone as Ascientific and just plain stupid as DumpTrump do?
108728	@LauraRbnsn Listen: God sent the coronavirus plague to punish this sinful world, fully knowing that scientists would seize the opportunity to implant the Mark of the Beast in the vaccine and distribute it to the Earth's population, paving the way for Antichrist just so... I'm exhausted  üò´
111167	A year ago, you couldn‚Äôt even mention this without getting censored, banned or deplatformed. Just think what will be uncovered next year about vaccine safety. Tick tock.
108857	#Covid19VaccineReport Don't just accept the vaccine because they say so. Find out what it is all about because you are still not safe after been vaccinated. Be wise
108280	Every person that breaks lockdown rules and those that repeatedly do so whether fined or not...should be a the last to receive any COVID-19 vaccine! They obviously believe they are immune or simply don‚Äôt care so they should be given to those who respect this virus! #covid19

111211	The anti-vaxer nonsense on Social Media is getting out of hand. Ignorant people undermining the brilliant work done to develop  #CovidVaccine so quickly. Already encountered this on Twitter today before seeing this
111541	Tier 0 is the new normal...Remember people the flu is a coronavirus and there is a vaccine ... guess what? The flu is still around.Lockdowns are not because of a virus! A virus so deadly you need to have a test to know you have it...which can still be false üßê

112868	my question is, how do we actually know if they are getting ‚Äúthe vaccine‚Äù and not water or some other shit instead
109766	@ethanndg @Nlechoppa1 to cause that's what they want you to. People who have taken the COVID-19 Test, were healthy and after they took the test, then ended up positive with the Virus. The COVID-19 vaccine ain't a vaccine. It has a chip in it. That's why Bill Gates is tryna make it a Cashless society.
108307	@jacorbol @Shwin1080 @malika_imani @letitiawright They are in my favor, that's for sure. Please do document your experience with the covid19 which is unlike any vaccine ever made before. Enquiring minds are eagerly awaiting our guinea pigs

110712	If it's not confirmed that already having COVID19, doesn't mean you won't get it again, why are some places trying to implement this antibody testing in order to get off of house arrest &amp; go back to work? Why would a vaccine help if the real virus doesn't give you immunity?
107869	Apparently, No vaccine is going to be rolled out for the Coronavirus for at least the next 18 months? This is getting scarier by the day. üòå
110340	People itch for like ‚Äúpositive coronavirus news‚Äù and maybe my head is just fucked now but literally none of it makes me feel even slightly better it all looks exactly the same. Only news I will accept is ‚Äúquarantine lifted‚Äù or ‚Äúworking vaccine created‚Äù

112753	I'm confused by all the different dates, and whether they mean the whole vaccine or half the vaccine. I guess the deliberate confusion is to help to continue with spreading herd immunity and fleecing the taxpayer? #Marr

108474	@ding_gang Malaria huh? I‚Äôve had my malaria shot and booster (the booster is a hum-dinger) I‚Äôm inclined to not believe this since a US Navy ship has #COVID19 and all sailors are inoculated for malaria in boot camp.

109062	Thanks to everyone who's spoken up and called for an advanced vaccine rollout. Now starting in February. #COVID19vaccine
110699	i‚Äôm honestly so so fed up of people thinking they‚Äôre scientists when they‚Äôre just not Highlights include:- why is no cure for cancer when we got a vaccine for covid-19 -covid-19 is just another flu -masks are filled with bacteria that will make us ill
107839	@JaggerMickOZ The vaccinated don‚Äôt realize the Delta variant they‚Äôre getting now is weaker than the original Wuhan COVID-19 strain. They assume the vaccine is why it‚Äôs not worse. Wait until a new full strength variant hits this winter. I think that‚Äôs when the ADE will really kick in.
110581	"I mean, it might work as a sales pitch. ""All y'all nakers are gonna die! The racist COVID-19 is genocide! Now get this vaccine!"""
112105	First dose of the covid19 vaccine is now in my body. My arm hurts like someone punched it, but otherwise doing good!
111469	Why are we not surprised. How can you possibly have a proven, fully tested and safe vaccine after only 7 months? What about the long term side effects, does anyone have a clue on that one? Doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
109184	I would happily continue to live like a hermit until there is a vaccine if it means my son can start kindergarten on time in the fall.
108707	People want to know what is in a #Covid19 vaccine, but they don't even check what they eat or drink. They swallow pills like they are nothing - and they don't even check ingredients. You know why? Because they wouldn't know what E171 means. But yeah, go on with your stupidity.
112831	There is a cabal negatively smearing this and azithromycin in combination because it‚Äôs inexpensive.  They want expensive vaccines big money
109496	@Tom_Fowdy Because it's a smart (though shady) thing to do. Only time will tell which vaccine trials work out and which fail. ESPECIALLY when there has been no successful human vaccines for a coronavirus yet developed.Not saying they DID it, only they have good reason to. Same for the US.
110523	Looks like Oxford has the best chance at a vaccine then, they can increase the antigen count quite a bit unlike other phases 3 vaccines that are currently being tested.
202135	I‚Äôm not a doctor but I‚Äôve seen people acting sceptical of the vaccine over this so I‚Äôll give my opinion. My dad got vaccinated and his arm was sore like when u get a flu shot. It probably isn‚Äôt something serious. I kinda need your arm not to be sore to play baseball
111861	Can we get paid to get every vaccine from here on out? So can checks be sent to us for prior forced vaccines. My state is paying 100/person for Covid-19 vaccine. Lol so can we make that a paycheck for 100/vaccine since birth. Also every time we get the flu vaccine too. Lol!
111004	When are they going to admit the vaccine does not work . And it looks like the vaccine gives you covid .
110565	@SChad71593015 They never were able to develop a coronavirus vaccine. And when they tried back in the early 2000's all the lab animals died!
108761	also the essay is about coronavirus vaccines and it‚Äôs actually cool as fuck so i‚Äôm here purely to ask if anyone would be interested in a thread about current corona vaccine research and how different types would work?
112383	@WHO @Sophie_Mokoena @DrMikeRyan Q: Can I stop wearing my mask after being vaccinated?A: No. We don't have proof that vaccines protects you against Covid19. You can still get infected and infect others after taking the vaccine.
112090	@hrkbenowen It will be a winter of joy!  The vaccine in itself is an infection of the cells, just like a virus infection.  It goes into the nucleus and instructs the cells to replicate a foreign body; that being the covid19 spike, a virus component!  Wish the vaxxed luck!  They'll need it.
111107	@waffaisback @dona17_mc They‚Äôve actually been working on a coronavirus vaccine for a decade.  They just finally got funding to have the resources necessary to complete it.
112361	@RobertEarnsha15 COVID19 is no better or worse than every other strain and every other virus or cold. If a vaccine is nothing but a small amount of the virus to allow me body to get over it, then I'll do the same on my own
201854	That second covid-19 vaccine is starting to kick in. Feeling fatigued and some arm soreness, but it‚Äôs worth it.
107760	I pray that these seniors families don't allow this to happen. This is extremely dangerous. Nothing is even known of this so-called Covid19 vaccine. The article gives no details concerning it.
111812	They‚Äôre going to inject 100m Americans with Dr Trump patent snake vaccine days before the election? Or just announce it and hope it‚Äôs enough to win him some votes before people work it it‚Äôs a hoax? Either way everyone involved is a danger to the public
112917	@POTUS @DeptofDefense - ENOUGH!  - make it a requirement while serving - we all had to get measles, polio, &amp; other vaccines to eradicate diseases and protect everyone.  This is no different.
109295	There are millions of people around the world without access to any COVID-19 vaccines and they would kill to get one. Meanwhile Americans are going to continue to get sick and die this year because they think they are smarter than a virus. SARS-CoV-2 is endemic. It‚Äôs here to stay
112365	No Vote No vaccine. This is business. So only in Tamil Nadu BJP is competing with Nota üòÇ. Never ever seen such a fool PM üôè
111895	@pfizer company has developed #COVID19 vaccine. Interesting fact is that Pfizer is the who invented Viagra. So, Whoever have consumed Viagra can tell that how effective this vaccine will be. Is there anyone?
108946	@Minapina7 I hope so, because Iran is not far from my country, but after the issue of the Coronavirus has ended and I have taken the vaccine so that I am allowed to travel...
112424	Please be a hero and volunteer to test for a coronavirus vaccine. You can‚Äôt get coronavirus from the trials. It‚Äôs not a live virus. I would volunteer but there‚Äôs not a location near me. Check this out, please.  https://t.co/sD1qvlgb6R
111903	These are the industries that @MassGovernor is destroying w/ his phased opening plan. Is it any wonder MA has the highest unemployment in the country? Big box stores never closed, meanwhile no parades until a vaccine. It‚Äôs nonsensical.
109205	‚Ä¢The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is reported to be effective against the Kent strain of coronavirus, according to the Chief Investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial.
108273	#COVID19 is not going to go away. It is something that will have to take its natural course and become a normal virus in our ailment pool, just like the flu. We cannot be contained to our houses until a vaccine is released to the public, in an estimated 12 to 18 months.
111965	This is how coronavirus in feline (FCoV) looks like ‚òπÔ∏è Before we freak out, it cant be transmitted to human. Cats infected usually wont survive, it is currently untreatable. I only have seen vaccine for CanineCoV. Truly sorry for your loss.
108022	@tractorbadger @LukeJohnsonRCP @Paulrichardsmig No it isn't going well for them. Not at all. But with foreign aid and known cures and preventive jabs they don't need to.Ask yourself this simple question.If COVID-19 isn't that bad because they have 'statisically lower numbers'Why has the planet locked down?

107727	@Pippov66 @GeorgeMonbiot That‚Äôs why vaccine equity is so important. The WHO has said that the whole world should have access to COVID-19 vaccines so we call all work in unison.
111637	@funder Is it possible to gather some bats and study them? Why isn't there a bat specialist working on a covid19 platform? Go to the source. Find out why bats can carry their own vaccine and humans can't. A human  cannot handle viruses from bats but humans are larger in size.
110089	in ireland we need to face up to the sad but true reality that #COVID19 is not going to stop till be have a vaccine but we can slow it right down and unfortunately a lock down is the olny way to do this there is no other way. We all know it as we need to wake up to fact that some

107728	Hi! i‚Äôm doing these polls for research purposes for my english class, please answer truthfully (and maybe rt so i can get as much answers as i can ü•∫) Would you take the COVID-19 vaccine?

201843	I got my first COVID-19 vaccine shot today! Huzzah!Also, the instant I took the bandaid off my arm started getting sore. I shoulda kept it on üò¢ bandaids are magic
110065	Yay! I got my appointment today to come and get my photo opp with one of the vaccine fridges. No-one must be inoculated until all the PR shots are complete.
112449	My hospital system is requiring the COVID19 vaccine for all employees and I'm extremely glad they're doing this. I don't understand how some of my coworkers work here every day and still refuse the vaccine.
110665	Joe is not only a real fraud but also a murderer, otherwise how could he possibly project anything like that, when there are advanced treatments/drugs; vaccine&amp; fast testing, can you enlighten me how? Of course the answer is: more fraud, just make up the data, right?
111831	@carolecadwalla @globalhlthtwit You get no immunity from a coronavirus, but the vaccine does? This seems counter intuitive to me - what am I missing?
110866	@htTweets @narendramodi No one knows what vaccine does.No one has guts to say vaccine is useless. For Ayurved medicines you are asking for data.Where is data for these vaccines.And if virus is mutating, will vaccine work? Show proof.#TikaUtsav #COVID19 #coronavirus @ndtv @aajtak @zeenews
112521	@AbundantLandUse @jjhorgan @adriandix One California Vaccinologist has said if he wanted to do an experiment to test COVID19 ability to mutate into vaccine resistant strains, he‚Äôd give a sample a half dose or partial immunization, not enough to knock Covid out, just enough to see if it forces adaptation. Well Bonnie?
111015	In my opinion we need to get used to live with ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù until vaccine is distributed to the population. Our grandparents lived during WWII. They worked, they even had concerts on the field and towns, dinners. It means we can live with corona too. Corona is better than war.

Coronavirus star player Russell Westbrick took all the shots. he said ‚Äúi treat my vaccine like I treat the court, i take all the shots‚Äù. Whyyy Westbrick. you built my house last week
109092	@RachaelGreen I agree and the majority of people would. Only 6% in the article said definitely not its a non story, most people would as long as there has been rigourous testing. Whether there can ever be a vaccine for a coronavirus is another debate. Sky news just making news out of nothing
110280	@AdamNutter This doesn't make sense. In what instance would it be mandatory? Someone gets Covid19, either beats it or has to go to the hospital for medical assistance but refuses? Has the flu vaccine been mandatory by law in the USA @RepThomasMassie?
112494	"Just try to get off all the markets emails and social media stuff you'll get from all these ""for profit commercial"" vaccine hubs"
111017	It makes you wonder why Trump and the GOP didn't exploit the creation of the covid vaccine to earn votes, instead they weaponized it against the Dems and made it political. They were in a perfect position to capitalize on it. Why didn't they? #COVID19
108934	@Travistritt Read slowly: When not enough people get vaccinated to reach herd immunity like for the diseases you mentioned, viruses canM U T A T E as Covid-19 did. So the vaccine needs to be check and tested so it can be even more effective against the mutations.
107982	@hmca19 @WPaulJones2 @khangliter @duty2warn It isn't as if Coronaviruses are new, the first human Coronavirus was in the 60s, and a vaccine was developed using much of the research and testing they had done for SARS in 2003. Furthermore, mRNA vaccination is new but not unknown, they have been researching it for decades.
108421	@chrissteinplays @GreatDismal Wait, if we take this vaccine it will not only protect from COVID-19 but taxes as well AND fix my vocal cords and music pitch?!
112561	@southsider35th @molly24742136 @AmyJacobson @ChiPubSchools It‚Äôs a simple concept for everyone except right wing extremist fools.  The vaccine greatly improves your chances of not getting COVID-19 or of surviving the virus if you get it.  For anyone with an ounce of common sense that‚Äôs a great reason to get the shots.
108750	@CKnorcal @RealCandaceO Actually a vaccine‚Äôs job is to prevent you from getting a disease. The COVID-19 vax does not do that do it is hardly a true vaccine. More like a therapeutic. So if you got the shot(s) you can still get sick, though likely not as bad. So not really a vaccine.
108712	@POTUS I got my 1st Covid-19 Vaccine Shot Today (Moderna)üôèüèæPraise God for the Courage to get this done @POTUS
112926	COVID-19 vaccine.   With this low IFR for kids and young adults, why take the chance on a new risky vaccine?  naturally built immunity better prepares the body for the next virus.... and immunity induced by infection is naturally selective resulting in lower HIT
111739	@hrprogressive @edyong209 um... it is a coronavirus with animal reservoirs.  there are no sterilizing vaccines, and there never will be. it is NEVER GOING AWAY.  EVERYONE WILL EVENTUALLY GET IT.  if you aren‚Äôt old or fat you‚Äôre more likely to be struck by lightning than die of Covid.  really. Do the math.
108386	Now that we have open borders and people coming into our country from all over the world bringing coronavirus-19 with them.  So now will they take the vaccine meant for USA citizens? Then will we be locked up in our homes or studio apartments for another year?
109474	My mom getting her covid-19 vaccine really has me in tears this woman deserves the world for holding it down üò≠
107935	@TONYxTWO It actually isn't a vaccine it is just a flu shot with strains they guess are going to be around that year. The covid19 vaccine will end up being the same thing, a shot. A vaccine is not needed every year. Just their way of making money and injecting shit into you, possible chip
201876	This is so sad üíîMy uncle in his 60's got a blood clot in his leg after the jab... Had to have his leg amputated below the knee. üò¢
111798	This past year has made me into more of soulless human robot than ever before, but there's something about my primary care patients who have survived the Khmer Rouge/ Cambodian Genocide now getting their COVID-19 vaccine in our clinic that gets me a lil emotional.
108555	Not sure why it‚Äôs not being reported much but the Coronavirus has been found to have mutated in Denmark and would make ALL current trial vaccines worthless.
109857	"""Govt may impose sanction on persons who refuse to take coronavirus vaccine ‚Äì Oppong Nkrumah"" You dont have what people are deemed to be refusing. procure it first, and let all above 18 take the jab, the malady doesn't know who a citizen is or an illegal resident is."
111038	So did I get that right? The fellow in the control group dies after being injected with the existing meningitis vaccine (supposedly safety tested) and already on the market? and they've bypassed the double bling gold standard altogether. Nice.
108559	#COVID19 mutation found in Denmark. Evolved in mink and transferred to people. This new mutation is immune to the future vaccine - so now all 15 mio mink in Denmark has to be euthanised. This was not on my 2020 bingo card #CoronaMutation
107966	@Aiims1742 @apoorva_nyc I feel terrible for the Capitol grounds staff that had to clean up the mess they left behind. Hopefully everyone working on Capitol Hill has gotten a COVID-19 vaccine, but I doubt it. There's no doubt that the entire Capitol Hill complex is teeming with COVID-19 now.
111651	So SARS-COV2 has mutated beyond the previous strains. How in the hell is a vaccine the world's developing now going to be effective against these new strainsüò¢üôÑ
109185	I'm not vaccinated &amp; don't plan on it. That is my personal choice because I'm healthy. My immune system is good however if I had chronic illnesses that effected the COVID19 if I got it I would do the vaccine! I don't promote it or talk against it. It's a personal choice. MASKüò∑üé≠

108048	@1stnamenumbers @JustATh27580793 @MLive I have nothing against vaccines, in fact all my kids are vaccinated.

202429	Never been more aware of my privilege than today. So grateful to receive my first coronavirus vaccine #docsforvax
109307	@great_martis @AvidCommentator There has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus. People need to get the idea that we need a vaccine to save us out of thier heads. What happened to swine flu, bird flu, the plague? They aren't with us anymore. Preventative options and contact tracing are key. It'll be over soon.
112352	Because Bill Gates prefers the trials with Africans over using animal testing.  And the African leadership makes them comply.  And they are the first ones to get the actual Covid vaccine when it comes out, as Melinda Gates stated.   They will be top priority.  Eugenics.
110563	Hey...BLM...The Gates have so graciously decided you all get to be vaccinated first! What an honor!! The very people who want to depopulate the planet with the use of vaccines must really like you guys so much they think you should go first! Just a conspiracy theory, right?!
108942	No vaccine in the 224-year history of immunology since Dr Edward Jenner developed the first smallpox vaccine has been developed under such an intense spotlight of media scrutiny as #covid19 vaccine candidates. Previous trials were paused too ... but nobody knew about it.
110513	@porszag @StevenTDennis 1/COVID-19 has mutated into 30+ strains. There‚Äôs no way of knowing if a cure/vaccine is developed if it will work on all strains. Even if someone‚Äôs been infected with one strain there‚Äôs no way of knowing if the antibodies of one strain will protect from other strains. There‚Äôs no

111435	Lost another family member to COVID yesterday. Then his wife, distraught and feeling tremendous guilt for telling him not to get a vaccine, took her own life‚Ä¶leaving their two kids behind. Will people PLEASE just get the shot??? #COVID19 #GET VACCINATED
110459	Ok #Delco where are the vaccines? Was told the pharmacy didn't get any deliveries this week. WTAF is going on? We had appts, but alas no shots. #DelcoSucks #COVID19
112483	So even once we all get the vaccine - by this time next year - doesn‚Äôt #covid19sk still persist, like a social condition, something to be avoided and never solved, like poverty, or like diabetes - manageable, but never in remission? This was simply #COVID19 Year Zero.
108334	Watching @JustinTrudeau press conference - what is the obsession with the US and the response in the past. I, and my family and friends, want to know if a vaccine is being worked on? How close? What are the steps? Can we have money to pay for food and housing? #coronavirus

109844	To anyone who says they will refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine I say fine, but then I DON'T think that I or anyone else has an obligation to make any sort of accommodation to keep YOU safe.
110940	To be fair, Europe has it in abundance too.  It is just in the fridge as people don‚Äôt want it after the disgraceful scaremongering of Macron, vd Leyen et al.  #vaccine #eu
110329	Exactly. If you‚Äôre not sick, you don‚Äôt have COVID. The vaccine companies understand this, why can‚Äôt  we get everyone else to?
112653	This is America, I am working hard to stop the exportation of any vaccine raw material and our hearts go out to the Indian people. Well, on behalf on the Indians or any human beings that needs help.FUCK YOU USA! You are so fake!
109881	@hellodumbass2 @carrieinparadi1 @faggo4you @RealCandaceO The mRNA vaccine was being developed for years. They only had to adapt it to the Covid-19 strain like they do with the flu shot every year. Don't take it if you don't want to. No one cares.
202131	And the first Pfizer Coronavirus vaccine is in my arm! Thanks #aqueduct and the #nationalguard, the experience was seamless, safe and speedy! I got punched by a jockey, but he‚Äôs just cranky bc he can‚Äôt race horses right now. https://t.co/81Zl2TKzKQ
110654	This makes sense! The vaccine is supposed to be there to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Though there is not much long term studies done, it is helping to try and get back to normalcy. #UNCWJourno
109404	@ellymelly @rob__angeles @ScottMorrisonMP I told people I would never take the #coronavirus vaccine because it is rushed and they looked at me like I was crazy. I have no problems with taking vaccines but I'm not willing to be a Guinea pig for one
109587	I got my second shot for the coronavirus vaccine my daughter got her second shot from the coronavirus vaccine yesterday and so far so good we both woke up feeling great thank God mind you in 38 years I have not have the flu shot my daughter 16 has not flu since 3 years old
109723	History is being made. We can‚Äôt get complacent though. It‚Äôs going to be 6 weeks before just this lady is covered by the vaccine.
109650	No origin! No vaccine! This bio virus has features of SARS, and other viruses. After 17years of SARS outbreak, not even one effective vaccine is found. Hydroxychloroquine is not perfect, but saves life! Take down Communist Party of China!
107958	How many will flu kill this winter&amp; will must be separate from coronavirus. Professor Valance said coronavirus wont be eradicate with vaccine &amp; it‚Äôs likely to return each yr like flu. To me WHO is problem with coronavirus world wide.
109508	@Matthews_angst If there are only certain vaccines in the world that everyone is being pushed to take against the COVID19 virus worldwide, then there is no such thing as variants.
109439	@rudigr88 @NimblyBimbly420 @BluzPower @Keefito33 @Sally40613367 @paulanoukas you can get it from covid-19 as well, since viruses can cause it. The link to vaccines is just another excuse by anti-vaxers not to get the vaccine.
110856	@alexbhturnbull It's all about the vaccine. Things will never go all the way back to life as we know it until there is a coronavirus vaccine. Until then we are just playing for time and coming up with workarounds.
109492	Correct me if i‚Äôm wrong pero i think only pfizer is the only vaccine effective against the south african variant, a variant who‚Äôs not only more transmissible but more fatal. Pero pinupush talaga ng gobyerno ang gawang china ano.

111772	Nobody will ever convince me that China didn't engineer the coronavirus as a weapon to be released into African countries to clear space for Chinese agricultural industrialization. They've been grabbing land for decades. It simply got out before they could engineer a vaccine.

107886	@HealthZA Want to know more about #COVID19 vaccine is not a silver bullet but intended to provide immunity against the virus? There, I wrote it again for you in @DrZweliMkhize words.
201992	@9NewsAUS @Gabrielle_Boyle It's great news that at least everybody in NSW (Including myself and my carers at Parracare) have had at least one jab of a vaccine against COVID-19 however, there is still a long way to go before we can consider ourselves out of lockdown. I have my second jab on 9th Sept, 2021.
112430	@MollyBeck @journalsentinel It is just plain selfish for 33 yo @AlexanderLasry to get the covid-19 vaccine shot. His excuse is unacceptable. Find a senior citizen. If you don't know any, then you're out of touch.
108931	@nytimes We developed multiple vaccines for COVID-19, but there won't be one for #Trumpism. OTOH, it seems we did achieve herd immunity against Trumpism by Nov. 3, 2020, although many fools still refuse to accept the cure for that, just like many refuse to take the coronavirus vaccine.

112857	@ERtravelRN @NPGardener @BaddCompani My brother-in-law said he was sick (the worst he could remember) in January of 2020 so he believes he has already had Covid-19 and believes he is immune and therefore doesn't need a vaccine.  There is LOTS of bad thinking like this out here!

201918	11/ So far, 36 hours after getting shot #2 of the #COVID19Vaccine (@pfizer), the side effects aren‚Äôt as bad as they were the first time ‚Äî mostly just fatigue and slight aches. (For folks who already had #COVID19, we tend to react strongly to shot #1.)
201878	Thumbs up! Received my first #AstraZenaca jab and looking forward the second one in 12 weeks time. Remember, this is a very safe vaccine with an extremely rare risk of side effects. When it is your turn to get vaccinated, please get vaccinated. Together we can fight #COVID19 https://t.co/uyeducO3hT
110034	This is BS, but I've known since the beginning that's how they'd get us to take this rushed and unproven vaccine.If you want your normal back, you need to take it back!
109060	Only snowflake sheep üêë subscribe to that bullshit. The strong actually don‚Äôt need vaccines. Our immune systems destroy viruses. Vitamin D and vitamin C.
110794	"When asked about getting the Covid-19 vaccine, Biden said, ""I don't want to get ahead of the line, but I want to make sure we demonstrate to the American people that it's safe to take.""He says when he gets the vaccine, he will ""do it publicly."""

111531	@uklockdown @Dr_Ellie The vaccine provide no immunity but reduces the effects of Covid19.It‚Äôs better to have immunity given that SARS CoV2 is here to stay. The vaccine provides no immunity whereas my immune system does.Corona viruses mutate hence its preferable to develop immunities as one ages.
110789	the main downside of mRNA vaccines from the point of IP is the fact that once it is out (lipid formulation manufacturing process), it is out forever for any other indications too. It will be end of their exclusivity. So, they will not divulge it voluntarily.
109693	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
108506	This is just straight out gaslighting. I had my flu jab done by a pharmacist last autumn, well before we had ever heard of coronavirus and when Wuhan was just a place my husband occasionally went for work.
111333	I doubt it‚Äôs China, the UK or the USA or any country that developed a vaccine or has an agreement with any vaccine distributer.
112587	this is from last week. i wonder how govt will defend lockdown in #ThirdWave #coronavirus #CoronaVaccine #Covid_19
110814	People do realize they don't have to take the vaccine if they don't want, right? There's no reason to prevent those that do what the vaccine from getting it!

112859	Come on people how do you really know what they are putting into the arm of @Mike_Pence or @JoeBiden as they go on TV to make a big show of them getting a Coronavirus vaccine. It‚Äôs probably just saline. people are so gullible they will believe anything
110315	@zacyoga @TimothyPSmith7 @rexzane1 It will be with us forever.  There's never been a vaccine against a coronavirus or the common cold. It is simply science. Just because a vaccine works on something else doesn't mean it will work on a coronavirus.
110929	@AndrewFeinberg Does he seriously think we're all as ignorant and gullible as him?  He.  Did.  Nothing.  They have been working on coronavirus vaccines for years, and really upped the work after SARS.  That's why they make them so quickly.
111724	@Baz4Ppc @FARIAMAL The existence of the new coronavirus has not been proven.It's definitely not a vaccine, as you can't make a vaccine against an unidentified virus.There are various types of existing coronaviruses, and even their vaccines, including SARS and MERS, do not exist.
109790	@ryanlee609 @RationallySassy @JoshuaBeraldo Wanna know a fact. There have been 2 other coronavirus outbreaks in the last 18 years. Neither of them have a vaccine. SARS and MERS are part of the coronavirus family and you're telling me that infecting everyone will protect against the next coronavirus in 8 years?
111191	of course, we are going to find a vaccine that will work 100% against #COVID19. This is what every country is wishing for (some are already making plans). I think no one has talked about plans in case no vaccine will be available. If I am wrong, please send examples?
108136	eh, by a bunch of eugenicists that are trying to thin out persons NOT like them and to get their minions to assist ans stay in line - or else. yeah, it'll be done just like the eugenicists said they would - via the vaccine.

112169	It absolutely flies all over that Bill Gates has the audacity to order everyone in the world to get a stupid Coronavirus vaccine which Fauci himself said may not work.
112026	Why would i get the COVID-19 vaccine if it doesn‚Äôt stop me from getting COVID-19 or stop me from spreading it? and I will continue to have wear a mask even if I get it.... no thanks.
108751	Swedish media is reporting that a vaccine for Covid-19 might be available already in September, the narrative went from 18 months to 5 months, I don¬¥t trust those energy vampires one bit, I aint having it in my body, rather take my chances
202244	@CeeJaay761 Absolute insanity! Moderna, the NIAID, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also signed a Material Transfer Agreement for ‚ÄúmRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates‚Äù just two weeks prior to the emergence of COVID-19‚Ä¶ Coincidence?
112759	"Let's stick to what we know: ""...not yet possible to say whether the administration of any vaccine would result in herd immunity in the population, because it was not known how effectively any of the COVID-19 vaccines would stop transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus."""
108410	Your health is not my responsibility.I am not afraid of COVID-19I have the agency to make my own personal health decisions.The harder you push the vaccine on me, the more defiant I become.If you're worried go get the vaccine yourself, stop trying to control me.
108064	"lotta people being like ""but it's a BRIBE!!!!"" yeah well if you had just gotten the (safe, effective) vaccine they wouldn't have to be bribing you"
110780	People in my area are fighting with other people in grocery stores over wearing a mask. Coronavirus numbers continue to climb. A vaccine is coming but it's going to be a long time before the average person sees it.
202072	So I wasn‚Äôt allowed to say anything until today, but I volunteered for the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer. The vaccine was developed in Russia. It‚Äôs in 6 different stages and I received my first dose this... MOAR....

201914	My dad and sister got their COVID-19 vaccine today! I feel better about them going into the OR now. My dad changed his mind after he found out his brother, niece, and her two daughters tested positive this week.
109939	Could open above 30k! What has been pointed out is that #Moderna vaccine DOES NOT HAVE to be kept in below zero freezer.
112409	@realDonaldTrump People who already had Covid-19 symptomatically or asymptomatically probably don't need to take any vaccine, since they already have antibodies to the virus in their body.
108369	This bears retweeting.  I lwas really hoping to spend some time outside with my regular friendsgiving peeps, but we aren't even going there.  In 8 months, vaccine permitting, we can party like it's 1999.

109013	@BusinessLiveSA Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
110047	Oh heck @SoniaPoulton you're mis-informed. Prof Sarah Gilbert has been working on a vaccine for a human coronavirus for over a decade. I don‚Äôt want to ridicule you but I‚Äôd urge you to do your research, you could stop someone having the vaccine with this sort of behaviour.
112136	Put the COVID-19 vaccine in Diet Coke or Coke Zero and two things will happen. All these anti-vaxxers will be vaccinated, or they'll boycott and I won't have to drive to three different stores to get them, because these fools keep 10-15cs in their carts.#GetVaccinatedNow
108601	just got my COVID 'My Vaccine pass', worked a treat, saved it using Google Pay, great system #MOH #COVID19
110809	@MarineX @JD_Meadows @laurenboebert LOL. You can't compare statistics for the 1918 flu to the typical flu we have now. Again, a vaccine was developed for it in the 1950's.Actually Covid19 will compare pretty closely to that pandemic. The difference now is there are better health care systems all over the world.
112053	My question it the anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists is this;If #Covid19 and by extension the vaccine is one big made up scenario, what is the end game?Give me a logical answer to that plz.
110998	Just scheduled my appointment to get my 1st Moderna vaccine shot next week. They opened up the age eligibility range to 16 and older today here in PA. I can't believe I can get my Covid-19 shot that soon. #tuesdayvibe #COVID19
109094	I found myself standing just inside the door of a restaurant yesterday to pick up my to go order, when I realized I'd forgotten to put on my mask. I didn't get panic-stricken though, because I've had my Covid-19 booster! I did get my ass outta there as fast as possible though. üòä
110790	Hypothetical question:If you had to choose between being intentionally infected with the coronavirus or taking an mRNA vaccine, what would you choose?
110376	@RichardBulling9 @nanbgood @latimes Yep. We‚Äôve never made a coronavirus vaccine, and the one they tried to make for SARS-Cov1 ended up killing the animal subjects. The virus burned itself out before they finished. It‚Äôs unlikely this one will do that. Ive been fretting since january!!
109876	Why is @JoeBiden ignoring the vaccine? Is Joe crazy? What is all this garbage? 1st masks don't work, then they do &amp; now only work with 2 masks. But China Joe apparently thinks none of this works. I guess @JoeBiden rejects science after all.
109383	It fascinates me the inverse logic of these ü§°. It like using alligator repellent in the bathroom and claiming it saves lives. It‚Äôs a cold type virus. Everyone gets them and there‚Äôs never been a workable vaccine for common colds.
112060	@NHSuk The NHS is lying. The truth will surface. #stayhome¬† is so you don‚Äôt find out their hospitals are empty. They abused care homes. This health service is evil. Do not by any means take the vaccine. There are no #NHSheroes, #coronavirus is a hoax not a conspiracy.
108284	"As per the script. They'll just start calling it flu when a ""vaxxed"" person has it , ""covid"" when they aren't contaminated with experimental gene therapy passed off as a ""vaccine""."
110778	I can't wait to get my COVID19 vaccine.I'm a little concerned how I will personally handle the vaccine. When I got my flu vaccine in 2020 I got a temp of 104.7.That's just me.Please people just take it.
108081	Legit question for my followers. @RepJayapal tested positive for #COVID19 from reckless actions by her Republican colleagues. But didn‚Äôt she get the vaccine?  Can someone please help me with this. I‚Äôm for the vaccine but this just came to my mind and I‚Äôm curious.
112285	This isn‚Äôt that surprising and honestly if this becomes like an annual flu vaccine it will normalize getting the shot and maybe more people will be willing to do it.
111907	The pandemic in South Africa right now is not Coronavirus. Petrol prices are going up astronomically tonight which would affect the price of bread, transport, and basic items but our leaders have decided to listen to the UN, WEF, WHO to mandate a vaccine that does not work
108498	Everyone is panicking over this vaccine and posting irrational and fake news on it. Listen to the ACTUAL FACTS. Get the vaccine or don't, but either way please shut up about it. I don't know about y'all, but I'm over this pina colada we are in and I'm tired of distancing #COVID19
201974	Excited for my friends with younger kids to feel the same overwhelming relief I did when my adult children were vaccinated last spring. Where and when Johnson County kids ages 5 to 11 can get Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine https://t.co/i7fb4KbZdt
110543	So the #FDA approved #Phizer #VACCINE, I still wont get it, not enough study done on it, not one person will say how the vaccine reacts with your DNA, my doctor told me I‚Äôve had Covid and I have the antibodies no need for the vaccine, don‚Äôt forget #COVID19 actually has a nucleus https://t.co/3i9e7D4duM

107722	@duggo11 @DrAnneMurphy @ciananbrennan @morningireland There is ongoing trials and now real world data too, and if there was none complete they will still be getting the vaccine, I have seeing the effects the common cold has on my child and covid19 will be detrimental to them if the catch it!
107784	So what you want me to believe is that coincidently while they developed the Covid vaccine it just so happens that a second dose and a booster of the same vaccine will work on the original coronavirus? Is that what you think I‚Äôm going to believe?
109017	@moes_taverne @Yetta_HH @NDRinfo @ndr They shouldn't even be receiving the jab if they've had coronavirus within a month prior.If they already have it, then they need to let that pass, wait a month, then receive the vaccine. If you vaccinate while someone is already infected, it will not work as intended.
109898	@beebdeaxoru yikes, my parents aren‚Äôt anti vaxx but ik some parents who are. omg how does she feel about the coronavirus vaccine?
109885	If you get the vaccine you‚Äôre highly unlikely to get Covid, BUT if you do, you won‚Äôt show symptoms, BUT if you do they are likely to be mild, BUT if they aren‚Äôt you aren‚Äôt likely to be hospitalized, BUT if you are you won‚Äôt die, BUT if you do‚Ä¶ sorry Charlie
108495	So Canada has just approved clinical trials for a Coronavirus vaccine developed by a Chinese biotechnology company. The new (or same old) Steve Jobs business model: if there‚Äôs no need for your product, create a need then offer your product as the only viable solution
202384	Just had my first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Utterly painless. Another step closer to normality. Grateful to be given the chance. https://t.co/rJ6GUkzMjm
109733	Not sure why this is getting so much criticism. Other than it not being available to üá®üá¶ stores (and me not being eligible for my vaccine yet), I think it‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs one donut. I‚Äôm no expert, but good diets include everything.

110977	@SUNYUFS @uupinfo  Can we vote on a faculty vaccine mandate!  I think a majority of faculty would vote for a faculty vaccine mandate.  We want safe working conditions.  So if you're really representing faculty interests, why not put it to a vote?
111327	We need an Apollo-type program with public-private partnerships to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine AND a universal flu vaccine. It would take 2 major pandemic threats off the table.
107776	@BuckSexton Here is the one suggestion We can all agree on.The Covid-19 vaccine should be tested on our politicians, MSM, and professional athletes first!If they survive, it is safe.If they don‚Äôt, We are safe!!!
109591	So what happens when vulnerable people have had their #COVID19 vaccine? Will they be expecting to mix with others as if the risk had disappeared for everyone? They still pose an infection risk and this needs to be made clearer, surely? @MattHancock @doctorshaib @drphilhammond
109004	@chrisyeem Thanks very much CJ. I guess this winter will be harsh for Covid19 spread. So after Christmas when it's warmer and safer is probably best to take the vaccine.

110440	Dumb idea I might actually do: If you're taking a coronavirus vaccine, buy far OTM puts on the stock of the maker. That way you're partially hedged if there are some bad long-term effects to the vaccine (the lawsuits will probably kill the makers).

109127	@F1ght4Future @DrLiMengYAN1 The COVID-19 virus is a unique coronavirus pathogen, and the so-called new coronavirus vaccine is just a placebo.Any medicine has a toxicological effect, it is recommended not to vaccinate the new crown vaccine to prevent unknown side effects!
109888	@DoniTheDon_ Delta is only mandating coronavirus tests for its ‚Äúunvaccinated‚Äù workers. If you‚Äôre going to mandate testing, I truly do not understand why you wouldn‚Äôt test your entire workforce (the vaxxed and unvaxxed). The vaxxed can get infected and spread the virus too. Totally weird.
111239	@JoeBiden You're a FUCKING IDIOT. The @potus does NOT approve a vaccine. A #coronavirus vaccine will be approved like ANY OTHER vaccine or drug. YOU ARE CAUSING PANIC AND DOUBT in a vaccine when it becomes available. YOU ARE A FUCKING WASTE!#HarrisBiden @TheFive #TheFive
108047	@darakass The Covid-19 ‚ÄúVaccines‚Äù (which they are only therapeutics, not actual vaccines) do not stop infection or spread. Neither quarantines nor masks stopped or greatly slowed the spread. If we want to get back to normal, just get back to normal, without trying to stop nature.

112373	So let me get this right, some peeps wont take Covid-19 vaccine because they dont know what‚Äôs in it or because of a so called chip in it, but would happily carry mobile phones around and eat whatever Mcdonald‚Äôs dishes out to them? Hilarious this aint! üò©ü•∫

107683	@rmkaymusic @bunker_pod @NinaDSchick @Dorianlynskey @sturdyAlex People have died because we don't have an effective treatment for coronavirus, not because they were waiting for a vaccine.
112908	@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I have never got a flu vaccine and I never get the flu. I haven't got the Covid19 virus that I know of.. I had a cold not to long ago but I got over it like I do with everything else. My bodys immune system works just fine. I will not put  in my body that I wouldn't put in a dog

110487	How is this going to work? Who gets the vaccine and how will there be enough? Do we even trust a vaccine developed this quickly? I hope proper testing occurs.
109195	No one: Absolutely no one: My dad: What if aliens came to earth with a vaccine for coronavirus but in exchange for it they ask that we give up Australia
112839	Why does someone who had COVID19 and show positive anti-bodies have to get the Covid vaccine? It's stupid. It's like giving the chickenpox vaccine when they show positive antibodies!@RonJohnsonWI @SenateGOP @SenateDems
108252	It truly is a gift- I‚Äôm in the phase 3 Pfizer trial and still not sure if I had the real vaccine or not- I think I did due to the strong effects after mr second shot !
108534	@out_th3re @ConservUSA38 @AP You obviously aren‚Äôt very intelligent, there is no stopping this. Have we stopped the flu after decades? Coronavirus is here to stay even with a vaccine. Shutting down the country will cripple the economy to no return. It would take decades to recover from another shutdown
108086	This is a good analysis. Consumer confidence will likely be low as long as immediate testing and a verified vaccine are in place.
109957	@AWokeZombie Not sure if this is a vaccine death or not. But it really has to be fully investigated. And if parents are reluctant to get their children vaxxed because of this uncertainty, I cannot disagree.

201910	I wonder how me (21) and my sister (26) didn't get Covid 19, when our parents (M58, F59) did (father got it twice). We both use birth control pills (Diane). All of us got vaccinated, but before vaccines were in Turkey they got Covid 19. #Covid19 #Pandemic
109147	We not only need a Coronavirus vaccine, we need a MAGAT vaccine. It needs to stop the ongoing spread of lies and corruption
111986	So you mean to tell me that the immune system I‚Äôve been building for over 20 years doesn‚Äôt work anymore because I stayed inside for two months?? After I done had all your little vaccines and shots? I‚Äôm not going for it.
110558	@ReutersUK Thanks, but no thanks. Not interested in taking a rushed through vaccine. I'd rather stick to my vitamins and zinc, and a good routine to keep me safe as it has done so since covid-19 started.
110808	They want to make your life conditional on the government app (‚Äúvaxpass‚Äù) and are desperately rushing to get them in globally before the sheeple wake up and realise there is no real pandemic and the jabs are unsafe and ineffective. They will control every aspect of you. #COVID19
108928	This is a fact not an opinion.If no cure or vaccine is found in the near future everyone of us will get it. Kagwe will gerrit, you will gerrit and I will gerrit. This is because of the many ignorant Kenyans who are not following the MOH guidelines. Sad but true. #COVID19

108628	@britneyxmariah Why wouldn't they trust the vaccine?The COVID vaccine is just a different version of the SARS Coronavirus vaccine that has existed for years. The only thing that's different about the COVID vaccine is which protein is included in the vaccine. Other than (1/2)

112916	@CamJunior1972 @ChrisCuomo vaccines prevent you from infection because it trains your immune system to fight the specific virus. This vaccine doesn‚Äôt contain COVID19 you imbecile, you positioned yourself and your family, they will get sick because you took a mysterious ingredient injection

109190	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe. If they don't, then the country is safe!!!#TrumpVirusDeathToll193K #coronavirus #indiawithkanganaranaut #ModiFailsIndia #ChinaIndiaFaceoff #COVID„Éº19 #DelhiRiots2020 #ImmortalSushant
111431	People will see these numbers and still go lime and then say they fraid vaccine. We will never be free üò©
109507	The work @NHSuk has done with the @pfizer @BioNTech_Group vaccine has been truly incredible. Shout out to the amazing @Emily_JR_Lawson üëáüèæüëáüèæüëáüèæ
111115	@UmarNaseerMV There are many reasons why herd immunity may not work for Covid-19. There is no vaccine, which is the most safe way for a population to practice herd immunity, scientists don't know if one can contract the virus &amp; develop Covid-19 more than once, n/1
112554	going out on a bleak limb and officially predicting a certain someone is going to take credit for this vaccine (which will not work) in order to get votes from dipshits and then the dictatorship REALLY kicks off
112901	What if this is all because DT doesn‚Äôt want to take the vaccine that he‚Äôs going to push on to Everyone else?! #DonaldTrump #COVID19
201840	COVID-19 just took away my last bit of happiness by closing my gym. That‚Äôs the last straw. Get a damn vaccine out
109135	Mxm, the vaxxers are quiet üòí. Not only do they spread bsüí©, but they be spreading the ‚Äúsuper variant‚Äù üòí.

107772	"@WIREDScience And after one year with covid-19 there is still no as an exact answer for the question ""does it work?"". I wonder if it is 'the rush for pruducing a working vaccine' takes the biggest portion of the medicine industry's time and resource?"
112300	@jacobkornbluh Don't have one, don't want one and everyone mind your own business,You believe a lie ,I am 60 year's old,I had covid19 last year it was a bad flu but I got over it ,I recovered ,weak people should get the vaccine if the live in fear , because fear will kill ya.
109002	What's the point?Testing results enable contact tracing and inform those who definitely need to isolate.  Without rapid testing, cases will increase until there is herd immunity (70% or more of population infected) or until there is an effective vaccine.
108362	Everyone during the shutdown: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait until this virus goes away and everything can get back to normal‚Äù *COVID19 vaccine comes out*People from my hometown: ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt getting no damn vaccine. They‚Äôre implanting tracking devices in you‚Äù
110923	They also have ZERO liability on any vaccine they produce. Major conflict of interest as they have no financial risk of making a dangerous product. Yet the sheep will flock to it. Ill take my chances with eating right, working out, and building up my immune system.

110521	Friendly reminder: A vaccine isn‚Äôt going to magically end corona. Please remember that when it comes out, we will still need to practice social distancing + washing our hands routinely + wearing masks before we can see any return to ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù.
112356	Get jabbed, or get Coronavirus now if you're young, enjoy the summer, save the winter. We don't want a reopening wave then.
110873	In the meantime we can all continue to play our part. We are urging all residents to get their COVID-19 jab - it's not too late to get the first or second jab if you haven't already - and encourage everyone to get their booster when eligible to do so.
111080	my sister's friend went on a whole rant talking about why we shouldn't get a covid-19 vaccine and how it's dangerous for our bodies...ma'am, you literally smoke crack. i think you'll be fine.

112384	Is this the winner that all will be forced to take? It does not matter, the vaccine was already available, this whole ‚Äúrace‚Äù is just a ruse.
112549	@dailyherald Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
112638	"""no Iowan should be forced to lose their job or livelihood over the Covid-19 vaccine."" @IAGovernor  I lost my job, my livelihood, and eventually my unemployment because others refuse to get the vaccine and I have PI. How is that different??  @OpePac #ThatsKim #CovidKim"
109821	Covid is now an epidemic of the unvaccinated.If you are lucky enough to live in the UK, you can get a vaccine.  Don't pass up the opportunity that so many others around the world don't have #GetVaccinated #VaccinesWork
108873	This is why no one trusts this govt. Who are these sources? Who is on the panel? What is happening considering till a few days ago, consensus was that one should get jab after rapid antigen test which showed level of antibodies. Just say you dont have vaccines, dont make up stuff
111146	I‚Äôm not surprised....if only the rest of Kansas could get with the program. Spreading awareness and education on the vaccine helps.
109232	Today heard 4 good news. Happy to share.1. #coronavirus is no more #pandemic. It will be a #endemic2. #OmicronVariant is just a #storm in a cup of tea 3. All the #vaccines are working against #OmicronVariant 4. No more #waves and possibly no more #Lockdown So,Dont worry
112488	@AldoAvina Been people in America getting reinfected. The flu is a version of coronavirus so why do we believe a vaccine will be 100% effective. Is it more realistic that developing better treatments is the way to go?
201933	@MamaTealRose @bigdaddyd2008 @MoodyMegsy @10NewsFirst Morrison need not worry because he took the Pfizer vaccine already.It have preferred if the healthcare worker in the Brisbane hospital that got infected with covid19 (revealed last night) had received his dose. #ScottyTheLiar #ScottyFromGreed thought he needed to have it first.
110746	As far as I'm concerned,  THROW THEM ALL OUT! Gates and the depopulate earth have got their kill vaccine motion. IT CAUSES STERILITY AND MISCARRIAGES! How better to depopulate the world! DO NOT GET THE VACCINE! It is also killing about 20%of elderly!
107753	I don‚Äôt think any anti vaccine conspiracy theorists should get the vaccine before me‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôm selfish
110032	@lemondrops42 I‚Äôve only seen Dems call it the Biden vaccine to troll Trumpers calling it the Trump vaccine &amp;/or giving Trump ALL the credit. Most Dems credit scientists, who began work on a coronavirus vaccine not only before OWS began, but before Trump got elected, during the SARS pandemic.
108343	"Why it take 30+ years to find this vaccine but 6 months to make one for the ""most deadly"" virus we've met?"
110375	@EVASrebecca @BrewersRaptor @SlavicLady88 @bobpulgino They could very easily die because people like you think it‚Äôs their right to not wear a mask. I guess you have proven you don‚Äôt really care about anyone but yourself...in true trump fashion. Geeze, this country needs a vaccine for common sense before one for #COVID19!
110970	@mdnij34 A mask will protect you even after the coronavirus is under control , but remember this vaccine is not a cure , and the experts don't know how long this vaccine will protect us from the virus that is mutating. This vaccine is in the testing stage .
202227	@LikeTheMountain Yes! My normally very healthy cousin died from Covid-19 last night!  Get your vaccine!
201904	@Travisdhanraj @maritstiles My husband took this photo yesterday. The same day my 70 y/o father who has cancer couldn't get his scheduled #COVID19 #vaccine because #ontariolockdown.

108862	Heard something on the news yesterday that there is no more budget for communications, all the money went to Digital vibes.They can't even go on a Drive to encourage Men to get vaccinated or clear up vaccine myths.
108327	the pfizer vaccine is now FDA approved. this confirms what we already knew: the vaccine is safe &amp; effective. please, if you haven‚Äôt already, go get vaccinated.
108910	Seen three posts on my TL of people getting COVID-19 vaccines. This is promising, hoping my parents get theirs soon üôèüèæ
202441	My family lost a very dear friend to COVID-19 over the weekend. Lena Warren is part of my earliest childhood memories and was more like my aunt. Our hearts are broken! And I type this tweet on the eve of my second dose of the vaccine. We have GOT to stop the spread of this thing.
112148	@aurorabennu @CSaulnierHfx Then you clearly dont understand what science is. Science is the study of information. Humans can be biased but science isn't. As for the scientists that developed the vaccines. Their work wasn't sloppy and this isn't the first coronavirus vaccine to exist
108203	After the election.They've also been conditioned to think that a vaccine will be their savior, despite the fact that no coronavirus has had a vaccine.
108988	@CloydRivers Folks liking this acting like they weren‚Äôt saying the COVID-19 vaccine wasn‚Äôt FDA approved and therefore they couldn‚Äôt trust it. So do you want the government‚Äôs oversight or not??? Lmao
111656	My job is having certain people try to get an anaphylaxis shot approved for those who are elderly that will be administered the covid vaccine. It has been shown the shot causes anaphylaxis shot in elderly patients.
201888	As of this morning, me and my parent got our first COVID-19 vaccine!! We did it. I‚Äôm so proud of this accomplishment! https://t.co/Nc7ELgVr6v
107859	@NotDevinsMom No I am 55 and in Wisconsin the registry has data back to 1960's.    It all depends on their ability to gather data and what the state requires of providers.    My COVID19 vaccines appeared immediately after I got the shot.    Then again WI is not Alabama.
108011	@piersmorgan True but the research on a SARS vaccine probably dried up when  SARS disappeared.  It doesnt mean a vaccine isnt possible . SARS was technically a Coronavirus
108667	Even #Jharkhand announced free vaccine.. But Shameless #Maharashtra govt is no intention to give it for free.. @OfficeofUT When are you going to announce it???? @priyankac19
109106	"@newscomauHQ @BaronBlacky @ScottMorrisonMP is quite mad!  Based on his past behaviour, we can expect it to go from ""free vaccine"" to ""everyone MUST get free vaccine""!  Why?  He's not stupid enough to think a vaccine will eradicate COVID19....surely!  Perhaps he‚Äôs hoping to ""flatten the curve"" again."
108469	@Goat_Jump_Ranch @_lorieeee @disclosetv Natural immunity from the original strain of COVID-19 is WAY better than the vaccine. If you‚Äôve already caught covid once then you don‚Äôt need to get vaccinated. EVIDENCE has shown you‚Äôre more likely to catch it a second time if you get the vaccine. Don‚Äôt go by what the say!
112104	It's looking less and less likely that there will ever be a vaccine for covid-19 so is @T_Deeney never going to play football again?
111298	Wonder what the real answer they want to track and trace Black, Indigenous and elderly.  Couldn't pay me to take that vaccine if Gates has any part of it!
112469	They stopped offering Covid19 vaccines anywhere in my area because most everyone is so old that they were eligible months ago. Now I am eligible and can't get one. I knew I was going to fall into a crack. I'm going to have to wait for herd immunity.‚òπÔ∏è
109046	"No.  I have NEVER HAD a flu vaccine, never had the flu.  Don't get ""tested,"" don't get the diseases they test for."
109551	Coronavirus vaccine will take 'many months' and 'there are no guarantees' one can be found, Business Secretary Alok Sharma admits as Number 10 announces first trials will begin next weekscientists are confident they can get jab for the incurable disease rolled out for millions

201961	@SunilKumarAus My friends 23 year old daughter got the #Moderna shots last spring. She just got her booster shot last Monday, then she tested positive on Tuesday for #covid19.
112408	@realDonaldTrump The medical experts will find a vaccine for Coronavirus but we need a vaccine that will stop you being a racist, mad, ignorant and psychopath! Only way to fix half the problems in America is by people voting you out.
108499	@AnnastaciaMP Remember coronavirus isn't Covid-19, the testing can't distinguish between influenza A or B, let alone Covid-19. But they hope you don't realise this because it blows the lid off their illusion to push the vaccine!
111558	To leave unjabbed frontline workers in position over the winter period when the system is most stretched and then to sack them in the spring proves that these are really punishment sackings for not obeying Government orders. If they were a real danger, they would be removed now.
109095	"It's as if the vaccines work and ""healthy immune systems"" don't know what they are doing with something they've never dealt with before... Weird!"

109512	Looks like my January trip to Italy is a no-go üò°Tightened #COVID19 restrictions, a new #SuperGreenPass requirement, the new #STATODIEMERGENZA, and the no acceptance of my @sputnikvaccine are huge red flags.This is awful.

111434	@dg101799 @johnnymcqueen4 @free_man789 There isn't a vaccine. But you know what Covid19 is don't you?.Far worse than they're telling you. See.survivors now getting really sick? Those with mild symptoms progress to getting all sorts. Only those under 18 that are unscathed. The Chinese only want the gullible to survive.
111507	Trenton NJ is really on that ‚ÄúWho do you know‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhich Church do you attend‚Äù to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. Which is why I must depend on County level to get my shot. Some of these folks would rather I die so they could walk their crusty ass into my Wake, than answer my email.
112451	‚ÄúSome models suggest.‚Äùü§®During the Jan 2021 surge (basically no vaccines) the US only hit 4000 deaths/day on 5 total days. And now, with HALF the population fully vaxxed, the models are showing it‚Äôs going to happen again?? Either the vaccines don‚Äôt work or these are bad models.

108264	This doesn‚Äôt actually surprise anyone, right? We all remember the millions of doses of Pfizer with nowhere to go.They were so busy taking their victory lap on getting the vaccine manufactured and approved that they didn‚Äôt bother actually planning to distribute it.
108010	Already booked in for my first COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday. That‚Äôs how confident I am that it‚Äôs safe. #Iwillgetvaccinated
109498	Actually the scientists all said they don‚Äôt know if the vaccines will work on the current strain. Studies are being carried out. What they said is if a vaccine was available they would take it irrespective. But since we have access to only a handful of doses it‚Äôs largely academic
111092	So basically the vaccine requires boosters after 8 months üßê does the vaccine work or not which is it ????

109678	@bennyf99 I stand corrected, apologies. I would still question a genetically engineered vaccine and I'd still be skeptical of its effectiveness as opposed to a healthy immune system. I don't want to take a covid-19 vaccine, my body, my choice.

112864	Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that doesnt have a vaccine. instead of not getting it (ala when u get a flu shot) some ppl will get it &amp; difficulty getting over it. Healthier ppl will get it, get over it, &amp; move on. It‚Äôs the inundation of treating the sick that‚Äôll be annoying
112381	It only applies to Canadian citizens, it's weeks away, and you may still have to quarantine at home. So the government's line is: Vaccines work, but only if you got 'em in Canada. Non-citizens, meanwhile, are an existential threat.It's just bonkers. It makes zero sense.
111029	Why? It doesn't make sense when they have said the vaccine doesn't prevent getting infected or it  spreading, only the seriousness once infected. So therefore it wouldn't make any difference ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
109998	Why is anyone getting a vaccine? I‚Äôm vaccinated because they said do your part, u can‚Äôt travel protect yourself  etc. I got sick after second shot. I will not be risking my health for a booster that does nothing to protect me or anyone else. Vaccines only benefit those selling it
108156	I think that this is a great way for vaccine public awareness. And it‚Äôs not like majority of us are going to go to Krispy Kreme everyday anyways. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è#krispykreme

109751	The U.S. needs to ship out the remaining vaccines now. If the idiots anti-vaxxers don't want it, stop wasting it and get it to people who do.
112446	The question is why did US start to develop vaccine if they haven't had any case in US or if China hasn't shared the gene sequences with world yet . Can't you get your lies straight? #COVID19
109830	@J_Effing_B @Dmack2407 @EthanStarr45 Because living a healthy lifestyle &amp; building your body's immune system will do more to protect you from a virus than an untested vaccine when I had covid19 back in July I quarantined but I also jogged &amp; walked around my yard to strengthen my lungs. Being healthy saved my life
111683	@realDonaldTrump This idiot still doesn‚Äôt get it! CoronaVirus is at a 4% death rate and spreading with NO VACCINE YOU IDIOT!! It will continue to spread and take lives with no vaccine. Then when they do get one, it still has to be administered, &amp; we know how well that‚Äôll go with you at the helm!

112641	You are Part of the Great Vaccine ExperimentNot every American will want to take the new Coronavirus vaccine once it has been approved.¬† But there are many who have already stepped up to take the vaccines that will help to determine if and when the rest of us should.
112305	If the new COVID vaccine is free, and it‚Äôs not patented, then it will alleviate a lot of the civil unrest happening now. People will stop dying and getting ill from Covid. No BBQAnon rallies. Families can hopefully safely go back to work. And the learning gap will slow down.
108551	@MontagueTerrie @RayUngerer Do you, or your ageing parents take the flu jab annually??It‚Äôs a virus, it mutates‚Ä¶. Annually.Covid-19 is a virus, it too will mutate‚Ä¶. Annually.
108641	As I recall, and I may be wrong, when the Polio vaccines came out there was NO charge for them.  My concern is the price Big Pharma could charge for the vaccine as they already do for most drugs. Jus' sayin.

112568	I know this is a high plateau but it‚Äôs working! The US will get this under control. Because, well, loads of money and vaccines. Which we may not have - however, we do have the reassurance that the vaccines seem to be helping with reducing spread. That‚Äôs enough for me to hope
109297	This is the NHS Chief Midwife, urging pregnant women to get the jab, even though we DO NOT have the data to say this jab is safe!! @TeamCMidO - we would formally like to invite you for an interview to defend your stance. Could you kindly get in touch please? üëç PLEASE SHARE! üëäüî•
109074	@tweettruth2me Antibody Dependent Enhancement. It‚Äôs been the fate of all prior Human Coronavirus vaccines (trialed in mice/ferrets, not humanity).

110954	@Nick_Pye If it ever ends üò° and aren‚Äôt they protected by the Coronavirus Law ü§î. Just like they will be with the vaccine üò°
111185	Remember when Right Wing religious extremists would go around murdering abortion doctors for Jesus? Well, those same people believe that the coronavirus vaccine will kill everyone who gets it...
108993	@YahooFinance @denitsa_tsekova Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

111336	@bluebug1954 @GovSisolak No thanks to everything you said. You‚Äôre welcome to get an experimental vaccine, I‚Äôm happy it exists for the elderly, but the young and healthy don‚Äôt need it. Especially not those of us who already had Coronavirus.
201826	Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday took the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at Delhi Heart and Lung Institute here.His wife also took the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine here. https://t.co/cVcp49xjHs
109977	@axios Not surprising. GOP are virus sceptical so don‚Äôt take precautions, which leads to getting infected. How many more times will we see this? How many times will they open up too soon and let COVID-19 run wild? Add in vaccine hesitancy and it could take a long time to get rid of.
109240	@IsaacMadengu @thehill He's very much connected with Anthony Fauci, who is making the vaccine push here. And many outlets do recognize Gates as a leading figure in the international Coronavirus response.
108689	@DrEricDing I am sorry, but He is not a Doctor. So He should not have a say on what is needed! Only the Doctors that have made this vaccine know how many shots will bring a person 95% coverage from #COVID19!
108114	Happy News: just made an appointment for my 90-year old mom to receive the coronavirus vaccine! So excited!!! ü§ó
108983	@Jgfleet661 @DemocracysBrnr @NBCNews The next coronavirus will be novel, but they will have a head start on a vaccine because of what they learned this time. Talk today was of a pan corona vaccine that addresses some more basic trait the family has in common. It may need to be tweaked each season like influenza vax.
108853	People really think they‚Äôre gonna get a vaccine for COVID19 and it‚Äôll all be over with ü•± this is our new normal,  you can‚Äôt completely eradicate a virus
111034	Please get vaccinated if you are eligible. Our great teamwork is our only way out #CovidVaccine #COVID19Aus
111795	"@BigDaddyLiberty That profile is the kinda idiot who STILL doesnt know masks do nothing to protect against Coronavirus.And that profile believes so intensely in its satanism,it is threatening employers they'll""meet their makers""if they oppose the misnomer #MarchToSaveLives for vaccines that kill"
109187	I mean we all want to return back to normal. But you can‚Äôt say that vaccine is proven safe. I won‚Äôt be apart of taking that. Plus I‚Äôve had COVID-19 before and am younger, so I feel my body will fight it easier and have built up immunity for it. We need to look after the elderly.
112664	When they develop a coronavirus vaccine -will the anti vaxxers use it? Or do they just oppose some vaccines
109006	I know Coronavirus panic is being used to try and put the boot on our necks, but what if it makes people realize they need to be a little more self-reliant in an uncertain world?  I'm hopeful that 55% of New Yorkers wouldn't take an experimental vaccine,
112528	I don't even want it around like the flu. Wish people of today were smarter about vaccinating. üòîüòîüòî Vaccines are the reasons we don't worry about polio, tuberculosis, the flu, measles, and so on. Maybe we won't even worry about cancer &amp; HIV w their own emerging vaccines soon.
201810	I just got the COVID-19 booster shot. Let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôll feel like I just woke up from a seizure again like the second shot. Seriously, that shit hurt.
111205	"To COVID-19 antivaxxers: The government already put  microchips in everyone (&amp; has continued to do so on newborns) when the ""Freedom Act"" was put into law after 9/11. They don't need to waste money on implanting ANOTHER microchip in you with the COVID-19 vaccine..DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
108747	So great to hear the Moderna vaccine is 94.5% effective against coronavirus. Any good news is so welcomed. But our reliance on getting this information through a press release without seeing data needs to change.
107952	Title: Asymmetric information and its influence on the distribution of the Covid-19 Vaccine. Meaning: no one is gonna go get it.
202021	My spring break summary:- 923 tweets sent- 8 virtues signaled- 2 masks worn (one over the other)And I got my COVID-19 vaccine. I forgot to announce on Twitter that I received my vaccine, but thought I would let every one know that I got one, because I‚Äôm a teacher.
108017	So they know not only that there will be another #pandemic, but also that it will be a #coronavirus again. Interesting.Thinking faceYou can bet that if they actually do come up with such magical #vaccine that it will be basically mandatory - even moreso than the jab for covid.
107883	If it is true my beloved government will steal the vaccine and sell it to our neighbors then vaccinate us water ( fake)
109221	Great for us. But American exceptionalism is dying.   The problem with this is that poverty stricken countries cannot afford any vaccine and there wont be any left for them. Covid-19 is world wide. Its even in Antarctica. The WORLD needs vaccine. @JoeBiden

108084	@itvnews If the ‚Äòvaccine‚Äô doesn‚Äôt stop transmission, you‚Äôve had #covid19 and recovered, why the hell would you waste a vaccine rather than protect someone else?!? This is the most absurd statement so far. Absolute rubbish.
110098	If there is no cure or vaccine for the old common cold coronavirus why would there be one for this newest coronavirus?
108465	This election is lost. Declare it a fraud, move to state legislators appointing the electors.  Take next 2 years to work on a true fair system, cost not object. implement it and test it, like moon shot, or covid19 vaccine priority. All chips on the table. This is it.

111295	@ZLoescher @rauzersg1 @9NEWS What a bizarre response. It‚Äôs not as if doctor Fauci is the only expert supportive of vaccines. The vast majority of them are. Covid is a novel virus. That means it‚Äôs new. And we‚Äôve never had a vaccine for a Coronavirus before.  The rest is just an odd series of deflections.
112760	Thank you @ReneeMerrifiel3 for bringing attention to this. It is too late for my grandmother, but many elderly will not receive vaccines for months. They deserve all the resources we can provide.
110583	The liberals are having a talk about the importance of working together during covid while they are in charge of the only country in the world where they didn‚Äôt work together and thus have Canadians rationing vaccines!
110591	My hunch is that a lot of EU expats got their #vaccination in their home countries, like me (though I then got my GP in Brussels to register my jabs in the Belgian system)
108346	I‚Äôm going to get my COVID Shots soon but I need to take my time with that. It‚Äôs fairly obvious that vaccines work but not all the time, which is why you take your time getting them. I became very sick and more autistic from vaccines but the stabilized versions do work.
109785	Well if distancing and masks are still needed then the vaccine obviously doesn‚Äôt work!                          And if virus doesn‚Äôt stimulate immunity then the vaccine won‚Äôt work!
111700	@timacheson @MaizyDaizyZzzz There goes getting COVID-19 under control  Especially with those South American numbers I bet they get the vaccine before US citizens like they have done in the UK  Yes Britain has the same problem and liberals suggesting mainland Europe is not safe for immediate
110321	@thelionrawrson @Conserve321 @GovAndyBeshear Science will tell you that children don't get sick from coronavirus. Science will also tell you the vaccine does not stop the spread it just lessens the symptoms. If kids don't generally have symptoms what is the vaccine for?
111708	@Abba_Annabelle @funder Between fighting Covid-19 and ignorance, it is easier to get the vaccine since it is very difficult to talk to an ignorant person.
112544	How to convince a conservative to get the vaccine:What? You want me to pay for YOUR ICU bed because you didn't take PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY and get vaccinated? You are so ENTITLED #cdnpoli #antivaxxers #covid19 #CovidIsNotOver
108387	@johnthefocuser @j88KBF @zev_dr The vaccine renders the coronavirus a non issue. It‚Äôs for the greater good to have it. Please do when the time comes.
107882	Or until you decide to give up your power, which everyone with a brain knows you never will.This is not about the vaccine, this is about control.
112610	@heatherschatz @WJCTNews Thanks for work on this.My two-bits --&gt; If no definitive vaccine in 2020 for #covid19, we would be best using resources to help restaurant workers transition to things we need today.

110462	@DrMadej I am a Korean. He has one son and he is a Christian.. I don't have faith in vaccines either. I hate vaccines. The distrust of covid19 vaccines in particular is very big.
110080	Ethically &amp; morally the right decision.  Especially if the US already has enough supplies. I'll actually think we need to be proactively working with health institution to make sure vaccines gets to everyone. This action is a form of leadership and a lesson about our character
111678	Lol what? You've been keeping morale of the populace up by telling everyone the vaccine was the answer, and life would return to normal. Well, now we have the vaccine, and you're telling us the pandemic still isn't over and to still follow all the precautions?? Get bent.
109571	I'm so glad I don't have to deal with the possibility of being at school for üó£Ô∏è IN-PERSON CLASSES IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WHILE THERE IS NO VACCINE OUT YET. üó£Ô∏èI'd nope tf out if I found out someone I shared a classroom with got coronavirus.Risking myself &amp; family is not the move.
110946	actually that's not so accurate.. we can get infected again with other strains because the virus is always mutating, and mutating very fast. That's why Moderna started on making improved vaccine for #COVID21 group. In Aug 2020 already 29 #COVID19 strains were found in Malaysia
109672	"@BrexitStewart  We trusted a dodgy ""Scientific model"" which has proven to be dramatically flawed. Yet we are pressing ahead with a vaccine, why? There is plenty of evidence to the contrary, which states a vaccine is not needed. Who decides if we need the vaccine?"
108173	It could be a blessing in disguise. More opportunities will come my way. My greatest achievement was getting into the University of Edinburgh Law School. I am very proud. Sadly, I think I have to defer until next year when there is a COVID-19 vaccine.
110243	"The ""no way we have a vaccine this year"" to 2.1 million vaccines initiated in first 2 weeks of rollout and extrapolating that out years ahead is an interesting new narrative."

110290	@laurenmill3r93 It doesn't change the fact its a human experimentation, hacking our bodies, never before this synthetic DNA or RNA has been tested on humans. There has been already many deaths reported but clearly they died cuz of covid19 and not this so called vaccine.
108800	@RichieAllenShow My main problem with the vaccine- if they haven't yet tested for a virus, but genetic material, then the virus can't possibly be what they say it is. SO- what exactly are they trying to force on people?? What is in that syringe? #StopTheNonsense  #COVID19 #KBF

110203	@CobbSchools great news!If you‚Äôre serious about ‚Äúencouraging vaccination‚Äù, it‚Äôs time to set up vaccine clinics, like many other metro school districts have done. Make it easy for parents to get their kids vaxxed, making school safer for everyone. No time to waste‚¨áÔ∏è

108328	@OregonGovBrown @OHAOregon What on earth did you think was going to happen? Oregonians will not stand for your tyranny any longer. If vaccines work, why are you shutting down? This is the WRONG way to motivate people to get vaccinated. You are out of touch with reality.
110863	@ann_eann @MrStevenCree @caitrionambalfe Exactly. My understanding is that you may still get exposed to COVID-19 but the vaccine lessens the severity of the symptoms. Ultimately, isn‚Äôt that what it‚Äôs all about? Not overwhelming the hospitals when they have a limited number of ICU beds, ventilators and staff to run them?
108483	"Unfortunately, yes.  You cannot take the Mark of the Beast. Staying away from the vaccine is critical. Please DO NOT get vaccinated. It is not a vaccine at all. This is a deception to capture souls while the world chants ""COVID"" or ""DIVOC"" and evil spirits latch on to the Godless"

109707	@genesimmons @FoREVer_A_BAT and @jerogan  If everyone got the vaccine they wouldn't have to worry about getting or spreading the virus. If they were to get the covid-19 virus and they had been vaccinated, their case would be very mild or asymptomatic.

Even the vaccine will not stop at just like the vaccine for the flu does not stop the flu. It is something we will have to live with
109872	@GMA @tjholmes Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

108301	@THEWRENCHLEFT @charliekirk11 It's not a vaccine quackie doctor.   They didn't even isolate the virus. They never could. They've been trying this on the oldest coronavirus in the book!!   The common cold.  Now tell me how is this PCR test possibly even accurate.
111934	@nytimes Oh my God I live in Georgia and I was talking to a handful of friends today some Black, some White. They were saying no way anyone's going to inject them with a coronavirus vaccine. They're both Democrats too. I don't think this is going to go over so well.

110162	Rather arrogant aren't you! If the prov governments had mandated vaccines for all those of age and distributed rapid test kits earlier then we may have had a chance to get out of this pandemic sooner. And not having paid sick days was unconscionable for those in low paying jobs.
202050	@kyrstensinema That being said i already had Covid19 and it only reduced my smell and taste. Now i have antibodies to Covid19. I still took the vaccine which didn't hurt me either.

108925	This is deeply concerning. 3 times in the last week I‚Äôve been asked by my over 80‚Äôs clients when they will be getting their vaccine. What do I tell them? @fmwales doesn‚Äôt want to rush it?? Disgraceful.
110703	My bigger concerning is that nobody knows how long the vaccine last effective, not even CDC. If this is something we have to get every 6months or less, there's going to be huge delay of plan bc then whoever categorized in high risk group needs their second shot around summer.

112649	@for_seagazer @_EMazing @emmy_angelle Yeah, the problem with vaccines in the past is they rarely got any attention or funding.  Hell, there was a vaccine in the works for I think MERS, which is another Coronavirus and it got it's funding pulled because politicians didn't think it was worth the time or money.  Idiots.
109770	My only opinion on the vaccine is this: I got one shot Sunday &amp; I‚Äôll get another May 2nd. I‚Äôve got people close to me who have contracted Covid-19 &amp; suffered &amp; people in my house with immunity issues so I‚Äôm going the safer than sorry route &amp; I‚Äôm 100% confident in my decision.
109370	@FRANK_SINATRA7 @Breaking911 All the shots are booster shots. If one is vaccinated they would have sterlization immunity. They would not pass on or get sick from the virus. Hence reality is there is no vaccine for this virus. Highly unlikely there will be a vaccine for a coronavirus anytime soon if ever.
202108	As of yesterday, 56.5% of the UK's population have had  one Covid-19 vaccine dose and 33% have had both doses. An incredible achievement.

111197	@aznananc @JesseUno @TulsiGabbard The vaccine is meant to prevent serious illness. If the elderly do get it, they don‚Äôt get sick. The vaccine does not prevent COVID-19 from spreading.

108631	Like any epidemic, there are still only three options to keep it under an epidemic threshold1. Indefinite lockdown2. A vaccine3. Enough immunity
110710	To be absolutely clear: Get the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as you can. It is right the experts are investigating, but almost certainly there is no real issue here, and even if there is an issue, we know it's very rare. The risk of getting Covid-19 and dying is worse.
110937	This is sad. I‚Äôve been rooting for all the vaccines. I‚Äôll be shocked if it gets approved here in the US...
109313	@Altxk @tariqtramboo You should get one serologic(antibody) test done cuz according to CDC, If someone who has had COVID-19 recently wants to take the vaccine, then ideally, that person should do so anytime between one to three months after symptom resolution, following infection with SARS-.CoV-2

108743	This is why anyone with a half-functioning brain knows the thing about a widely-distributed, effective vaccine in the next couple of months is... well... bullshit
108103	I I think getting a vaccine developed is a good idea ‚Äì vaccines have saved a lot of lives and this is a very weird virus we can‚Äôt hide out for three years.  I‚Äôll take them back soon because I want to see my grandma!
108142	Since so many red-staters don‚Äôt want their vaccines, why can‚Äôt those of who may need a booster just take theirs right now?
111829	I'm confused. As far as I am aware these vaccines do not prevent acquiring OR spreading the virus.The conflicting information is troubling to me which is why I'm waiting and NOT getting a vaccine.Media, medical, and government need to pick a lane #ldnont @fordnation @WHO
112241	From what I'm reading, it looks like the coronavirus vaccine process is going to be in multiple waves over the course of years. The first vaccines will only give temporary immunity and the population will have to be revaccinated every few months or every year.
109485	So it looks like people are going to be forced to get the covid-19 vaccine if they want to go to college or keep certain jobs, it seems like none of the representatives in office are doing anything to stop it.

109340	@EmaGabrielaS @IngrahamAngle The premise here is completely wrong. We know the flu has a shelf life, and we have new vaccines for it every year.This is a NOVEL CORONAVIRUS. That means we have never seen it before and that we have no immunity to it. Also we still don't know how well survivors will get along.
108714	I find it frustrating that people didn‚Äôt get the vaccine UNTIL it affected them personally. Not doing it out of wanting to protect everyone around them and themselves, but until they were affected.
112746	this most likely will be what ppl will get every year, like the flu vaccine. new boosters for variants. this vaccine is still in ‚Äútrial stage‚Äù and they don‚Äôt wanna admit it
107893	We need to make the #CovidVaccine mandatory.  Those that don‚Äôt want to take can move to #Detroit , can‚Äôt fuck that place up.  They can then play the herd immunity game with each other.  Once #COVID is gone they can return to society.  ##COVID19
202161	Residents and staff at Parker at Monroe celebrated receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday. #parkerlife #covid19vaccinated https://t.co/KOP3APuSRJ
108736	Okay. If the #vaccine has to be 80 degrees below while shipped &amp; stored. Will they pull it straight from freezer to administer? Wont that be like a hotshot only backwards? How will that feel???? #COVID19 #COVID19Vaccine
107815	@TheAnswerer1 they may be. no vaccine is going to work against a coronavirus. that's why they have new ones each year for new strains. that and the $$ it generates. And of course, if JJ sees everyone else getting paid on the booster train, they are jumping on board.
109809	Allowing #Covid19 to spread uncontrolled across US is just prolonging the pandemic. And we are creating perfect conditions for a worse variant to be created that will evade the vaccine even further.It feels like US is on suicide mission and taking whole world down with us.
107998	Why are people tweeting about the covid vaccine with ‚ÄúJUSTSAYNO‚Äù included in their tweetsOh right, they‚Äôre idiots who think Covid-19 is a lie. I forgot.
112167	I still wear my mask inside places. It doesn't take much for me to do that for other people.We know vaccines only help ourselves, that's what all vaccines do, they protect the person who gets the jab but we still have to stop the virus from spreading.
110037	@FCN2go Ya.. this is how they SECRETLY give you this so called vaccine for the Covid19. Plus whatever else they have in mind or up their sleeves.
110073	"We have called this ""Data Tax"" for a good reason. If you are poor and have no money, and you don't get a Vaccine, then people get that it is cruelty. But if you refuse to part w/ your data, and don't get a Vaccine, it might be called Kindness and people may not notice."

112937	Why ffs!? A gorilla coughs, they swipe it with a pcr swab (probably false positive) then create a vaccine for it....WTF!
111307	So now we have famous musicians trying to encourage people NOT to get vaccinated? I don't even know what to say anymore. There are vaccine mandates for other vaccines, and COVID should be no different! I can't believe there are parents out there who won't get their kids vaccinate
110638	So what if we don't get a viable vaccine or medication in the immediate future and it takes 2, 5, 10 years? Or worse, we never get one.
108251	We‚Äôve had a vaccine for a good 6 months now?I can‚Äôt &amp; won‚Äôt have any sympathy for them anymore. If they‚Äôd rather listen to an ex reality tv actor, twice impeached *president than DOCTORS &amp; SCIENTISTS, may God have mercy on their soulü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

112939	@Jules_Cath @dianeCDee @Cleavon_MD @benjaminbutter A change in the spike protein- which allows the coronavirus to enter and infect human cells- that is radical enough to make our vaccine completely ineffective would also, almost certainly, be so extreme as to make the virus non-functional.‚Äù -Oxford Team

112598	@LBC @NickFerrariLBC This is not about a virus, this is about getting EVERY man,woman &amp; child to accept Digital ID‚Äôs (sold to you as vaccine passport)so they can impliment their financial reset &amp; social credit scoring (China style) covid19 is just their tool to get you to accept it.
108292	@Astartiel @JustMarilyn7 @KitterleCathy My concern is considering this is a coronavirus (the same kind that are common colds) that they won‚Äôt be able to make a vaccine that is effective. We don‚Äôt have them for common cold coronaviruses. I am hopefully, for good treatment options though.
109433	Yeah, but it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs vaccine rollout that violates muh freedumb, so we certainly won‚Äôt get vaccinated. Plus, having a national healthcare system is socialism. So I guess we‚Äôll just have to get sick pay for it out of pocket.Makes sense, don‚Äôt it?*Sarcasm*
107830	@thegriffin666 @RichardDawkins Since you are some kind of expertise in this field. Do you think that it is likely, that the world‚Äôs population of humans get vaccinated. Before the vaccines available will be outdated, due to new Covid-19 mutations. Like the common flu virus?

108903	It is not necessarily a question of antibodies.It is about how our T-cells function.There is doubt, that it's advisable to have a jab, if you have had Covid19 infection, as your immune system could go into overdrive (Cytokine Storm/ ADE).Q: How long does immunity last?

My grandkids were able to say NO at their job and they are still working so where is the force?
110544	Interesting notes:Initially, vaccines protect the individual‚Äîit‚Äôs not until larger percentages of the population get it that it reduces population-wide rates.People with #COVID19 antibodies should still get the vaccine.

110826	On this #InternationalWomensDay I would appreciate a RT! I‚Äôve put my heart, soul, and body into this #COVID19 vaccine trial series
112632	These spikes are crucial to the virus‚Äôs ability to infect and spread. Because spikes are such an integral part of the virus, it is unlikely that any variants will not have them. Therefore, the vaccine will work against them too! Go science! #COVID19
111853	@ObeyWide @HighWireTalk Yes it's called animal testing. They have never successfully developed a vaccine for the common cold (animals usually die when introduced to the wild virus)That's what a coronavirus is. Now they have to test on humans to further the research. Your statement was partially correct.

110350	Y‚Äôall are killing me. So the virus is gonna end by us all collectively staying on lockdown... forever? And not the government using this time to create a vaccine and tests for immunity? America is trying to patent the vaccine before it‚Äôs even been made whi-#Day13 #StayHome

111174	@zanaturalhealth @rcr_pereira @geoffreyyork @MarianneThamm The purpose of not going for ‚Äòherd immunity‚Äô is that there is more time to find a cure. The concept of herd immunity in the absence of a vaccine just means everyone gets sick - it is not a cure. For Covid19 80% need to become infected and then immune. How is that good news?

And I'm quite sure there is just one strain of COVID-19, hence why all the vaccines are focusing on COVID19. So How can Boris get the virus again if he's already got the white blood cells or t-cell immunity?

111639	@Oregonian I am all for vaccines as they are proven safe, and often the side effects are little compared to what the vaccine is for. I even get flu shots and stay healthy. As long as a Covid-19 vaccines was properly tested as other vaccines, I would get one.

No surprise, the scientist can't stop the common cold, and we still get flu with the so-called vaccine, so let us get our economy up and running again. We can't keep hiding from a virus. Let the vulnerable and fearful stay safe.

110274	@arinudman @maskartists @richardursomd The COVID-19 vaccine really isn‚Äôt a vaccine in the medical definition of a vaccine. It does not improve your immune response to the infection, nor does not limit you from getting the infection.
108039	@andygoldstein05 So we have a virus in the world that we may NEVER find a vaccine for and will always be around like the common flu, good luck to you staying in lockdown and keeping kids out of school FOREVER! Covid-19 is going nowhere anytime soon........
111894	@mithisa_motho This is not true. Check on WHO website or google you‚Äôll see SARS-CoV has had vaccines for years and covid-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. I don‚Äôt know what you mean there‚Äôve never been vaccine.
112650	This is an appropriate step - a pause - while the data can be evaluated.   Such clots occur regularly in the population, so this MAY or MAY NOT be related to the vaccine.  That is why the investigation and pause is appropriate.

110042	Whistler, Prince Rupert, the Downtown Eastside, Long-term Care. If you don't believe the good news from other countries, then believe what we're seeing here in BC. Vaccines work. They are the clearest path out of this pandemic. Thank you @j_mcelroy for telling this story.

107867	@fangirlsmash @GravesWilliams6 I had all those diseases and have natural immunity. Also those vaccines  went through rigorous testing. They also aren't Coronavirus' which are different.  üôÑ Thus vaccine doesn't stop the spread.  Why aren't they mandating Flu vaccines.  My friend died in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
111717	not gonna celebrate until I see these vaccines rolled out and no, not gonna praise the govt for the bare minimums
109908	My only guess on why we are taking the Covid vaccine is to ease symptoms.We will all get Covid and unfortunately people aren‚Äôt listening to me about what vitamins and minerals to take to lessen its impact.Without this potentially harmful vaccine.
109273	In case anyone‚Äôs still wondering why these craven GQP pols have done a 180 on vaccines and virus mitigation. Owning the libs has backfired spectacularly.
107992	@Local12 Are the only parent who knows without a vaccine my child's going to love to go to school without being vaccinated up-to-date so is there a covid-19 vaccine that I don't know about for next year or what
112122	@HappyDragon95 Honestly, I can't wait until we have a vaccine out for this so we don't have to worry about getting/spreading COVID-19 as much
111069	Here‚Äôs the Toronto Star trying to push the same globalist agenda. Not happening. Masks come off once the vaccine is readily available. If everyone puts this intent in their mind, it will materialize. Question is how long will humanity let itself get pushed around? When is enough?
110372	Like she üëáüèΩ says in the second video , ‚ù§Ô∏è will get is through ‚ÄúThe Dark Winter‚Äù as articulated by the great James Corbett It will get worse before it gets better.

107928	Stop spreading stupid misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccine. No it‚Äôs not deadly, nor will cause any irreversible effects. If you don‚Äôt want it, stfu and move along for someone else to get it.
110088	@Avislafin1 @BigBrotherWatch @rld_real_CPR @silkiecarlo If you've had the vaccine, or coronavirus and thus have immunity, why do you need 'reassurance?'

109181	@combienDUtemps @LonelyChell79 @brentstuder @PeterHotez Right, they have plenty of research done on other coronaviruses, just like boeing has decades worth of research designing planes. It still takes boeing years to design a New plane, just like it would take years to develop a vaccine for a Novel coronavirus.
202093	Yesterday, a meagre 50k doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Colombia, a country with almost 60k COVID-19 deaths. After an overblown ceremony at the airport and a freaking motorcade, vaccine roll-out finally started today. This is how it's being handled. üò©
111199	At this point, I'd prefer to be called an antivaxxer...if being pro vax is to participate in this circus, sorry not sorry.Who takes so many 'vaccine' a year? Since when is that a thing? And if you refuse you are labeled anti science?Get the F out with your new science. Sheep.
112777	@fitterhappierAJ @CharletonOonagh Not one to attack scientists for scientific discussion Coronavirus/all RNA viruses have never elicited much memoryMaybe we can link Tettox like for Pneumococcal/HiB in infants, but twice yearly boosters are the absolute minimum we can hope for.So control is way to go instead

111627	Drinking alcohol after getting a coronavirus vaccine can significantly blunt the immune response and potentially render the vaccine ineffective, according to a leading Russian scientist.Dec 11, 2020#vaccine #alcohol #drinking #ineffective
109202	@Underground_RT @cathyraats They did do the first satellite and man in space. Not surprised they are first with a Covid19 vaccine.
111243	@Tony__Heller There are two ways to get herd immunity:  1) get the virus  2) get a vaccineThe last coronavirus vaccine took forever to develop, test, and get into production.And by ‚Äúforever‚Äù I mean it‚Äôs never happened.
108727	I am 1 of the 8. I‚Äôve received both vaccines, test twice a week for work and attended many in-person meetings relating to council matters in recent weeks, undertaken safely/professionally by our fantastic council staff. Labour‚Äôs unpopular #GreenBinTax is why they don‚Äôt want this!
110139	@GovPritzker coronavirus vaccine only work if you don‚Äôt have virus it does not work if you already go it or are sick with the virusWear the mask
111036	Just like the Influenza vaccine....doesn't mean you're not going to get the Flu..however, if you do, you won't die!!!
110091	Of course not...he wants to take credit for a vaccine even if it ends up killing us all after the election.
109602	@David_Durkan23 @judetigger @DarranMarshall For crying out loud!  Why do you lot think that people's reason for not wanting the #CoViD19 vaccine is a fear of pain or needles?  Do you think that these people have never had vaccines?  Do you think that they do not go to the dentist?
109286	I think it is best to be realistic. #COVID19 has come and will stay with us. Hopefully, a vaccine has been developed and available in 1 year. It is interesting to think about if we could do the same as in South Korea, mapping every person that has tested positive,&amp; their network.
107850	@WJCork My reason FOR getting the vaccine is for a religious reason. To love my neighbor as myself and being vaccinated with allow me to take the gospel to the nations and not worry about taking COVID-19 too
112893	If you want to get vaxxed do it because you want to!!! I‚Äôm not afraid of anyone who‚Äôs un vaxxed, they pose ZERO threat to me or anyone else!! #Startlivingagain #COVID19 fear mongering is for show only!!!
109585	@LorienElros @BarackObama @POTUS Sorry he passed. But no vaccine has ever had 100% efficacy. The Covid-19 vaccine has a 78% efficacy and the booster increases that.
111601	@JJWUrology @ecclesias @SummerPMHNP This disaster right now exists Bc a deadly virus has been politicized. There‚Äôs a vaccine available to disarm the deadly virus‚Ä¶politicians refuse to speak TRUTH to their constituents.Covid-19 has a cure. It‚Äôs a vaccine!Those refusing the vaccine are occupying all the beds!
112478	So they lost the market for their covid-19 vaccines and now they produced new virus so called omicron so that they can sell it's vaccines and overcome the loss they faced. Poor @ASTRAZENECAUK@AngelMutabaruka @imfurayiwacu @IGIHE @AJEnglish
109241	@Boabbysam @timfisher836 Right. And Covid-19 vaccines are effective. There is no truth in advertising. This is opposite-speak.
108234	@Macro__Business @anonymouse476 @Chuckjson @realDonaldTrump Actually you could develop a vaccine for a cold strain but the mutation rate of those viruses would render it useless quickly. So far novel coronavirus doesn't do that so there is hope. The Oxford vaccine looks promising and that is the trial I entered
107786	If this doesn't disturb u then u are lost. The vaccine makers will not accept legal responsibility for harmful side effects &amp; since NGO's can't afford to, these people cant get a vaccine.But 'this is about health. The vaccines are safe.' Oh &amp; my favorite -'the vaccines are free'
111002	Really cool that the US can fast-track development of a vaccine for coronavirus, but...  You're not going to get the coronavirus vaccine.  Why?  Half of Americans don't bother getting a flu shot in any given year.

111718	If there has to be incentives in order to try to get the American people to get the vaccine, then (in my opinion) it is not nor ever has been a serious threat!!!!!!
110198	I wonder if the anti-vaccine crowd is throwing coronavirus exposure parties like they do with measles or things...whatever doesn't kill you I guess...

111456	@TheChuck1nator @Smilan317 @GovMurphy @B52Malmet I don't understand WHY you people that were JABBED think  it's okay not to wear mask or social distance just because CDC said so? Don't they also say the jab doesn't protect you from NOT getting Covid19 or variants of it or spreading it? It's just for supposedly less severe?
109057	@TheFreePeopleA1 @DHSCgovuk Our news site tracks the progress of the vaccine for COVID-19 spanning all nations, it's prbly the case Americans will get access to the vaccine. The more interesting ques. remains precisely how effective it ends up being.
112196	Y‚Äôall need to quit being bitches and get vaccinated. The vaccine is a product of years of research about coronavirus strains that existed before Covid-19. If they were going to push out an unsafe vaccine it would have come out a year ago when the pandemic just started.
108523	This is a reminder that these shots are not actually vaccines. They don't prevent spread, they don't stop you from getting Covid. All they do is mitigate symptoms for a limited time. That's not a vaccine, that's a treatment.
108608	This applies no matter what country you're in, but especially the US and UK. We know a vaccine is coming now, but it will be months before that starts having a effect and we all still have a part to play until then. We've come this far and need to keep going. #WearAMask

111311	@CuomoPrimeTime @donlemonChris, until everyone who wants a covid-19 vaccine can get, it would not be fair to give preferential access to those who can get it. It would be double discrimination and it would only incetivize the well connected to skip the line even more.
112336	@RichLowry Liked your op-ed on the virus. Coronavirus is not red or blue. But your point that DeSantis has always said vaccines are the best defense against it somewhat undercuts your position - if so, why not mandate them? Just sayin' - keep up the good work. Thanks.
109928	@NBCNews #COVID19 does not care about religion.  If any person will not #WearAMask then they should just stay home. Not wearing one is harming millions of people &amp; 1000s have died so I don't feel sorry for anyone who refuses the vaccine or who refuses to wear a mask for ANY reason!
108820	@DrOz I think the president is wrong. This is not like the flu. We have vaccines for that. We need to stay home until we have a vaccine for COVID-19
111198	Why is there no pressure to find a coronavirus cure only the vaccine? Because there are more healthy people in the world who will take the vaccine. Someone needs to make money on it. You do the maths.

108697	16. The virus will die off when temperatures rise in the spring 17. Coronavirus is the deadliest virus known to man 18. Flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against COVID-19 19. The virus originated in a laboratory in China 20. The outbreak began because people ate bat soup  (4/7)

107866	@wjxt4 Why is there no vaccine for the cold? Its a coronavirus. It mutates like the flu. But you can't make a sterile vaccine for either. That's why they are still around. Don't worry, coronaviruses weaken over time. But big pharma doesn't want you to know.

109893	I‚Äôm in no way blaming anyone for getting vaxxed. That is a personal decision and choice. This is my story. The person got vaxxed and it shed to child getting us sick. That‚Äôs how it happens just letting you know now I had natural Covid19 twice. I‚Äôm not getting vaxxed. #takenoshit

110671	More and more this makes sense. Mask mandates and strong lockdowns are not having the desired effects. Vaccines are. I'm planning on my annual flu shot either Sept or Oct too. It's time to get out of reactionary pandemic thinking. Get vaccinated. Period. And live. Or whatever.
111423	@KendraElyse_ @sunflowercxty @CahillKellie CAUTIOUS is a thing as well. how‚Äôs there a vaccine for COVID-19 in 8 months when they couldn‚Äôt find a STABLE vaccine or cure for cancer or HIV/AIDS ?? they only have treatments for those in YRS! ppl express choice over masks, which is STATE MANDATED ... we can choose here too!
109078	@CBSNews You have got to stop calling the Covid-19 shot a vaccine. It isn‚Äôt a vaccine. Fact! If you can acquire this virus ü¶† multiple times after you received the Covid-shot, take a guess folks. It‚Äôs not a vaccine. The correct terminology is COVID-SHOT. Misleading the human race!
202347	Practically admitted by @CMO_England tonight...Well known by those that have had the vaccine already and still got ill.
112238	@BradleyCarlvin1 They say it takes some days for it to work... Secondly they don't check people they vaccinate, in my assumption people get covid-19 jabs when they're sick already
111145	@debbiekadams @kyrstensinema Evidence tends to show that herd immunity to this virus is not possible. A vaccine is also questionable. Coronaviruses are notorious for mutating and so far there has never been a successful vaccine developed for any coronavirus. Good luck!
109521	@PnarBradford @Capt_Kremin @SkyNews That is clearly a stupid criteria and you avoided my question. Out of interest to you though, they started on the generic coronavirus vaccine research around 10 years ago.
110449	Am I correct on this assumption..... after getting vaccinated you can still get Covid-19 however you will be asymptomatic? The vaccine does not keep you from contracting the virus?You can be positive for Covid and also spread it unknowingly because you‚Äôre asymptomatic?

110762	@BrianKempGA You should‚Äôve told Trump to give up this wild goose chase. He should put the energy he‚Äôs using to find fraud and put it in planning how to distribute the coronavirus vaccines that are coming out. At least he will go out on a positive note.
108482	"This covid-19 is a farse! Trump has done very little because he and Bill Gates have a plan to label the virus so far out of hand that EVERYBODY has to take that ""Death"" vaccine. This is an attack on Americans. Just shut down thw USA for 1 month! Find a program to feed folk only."
110504	@AlboMP 1) Our kids are statistically unaffected by Coronavirus‚Ä¶2) The ‚ÄúVaccine‚Äù was developed 2 years ago and does little, if anything to affect outcomes in relation to the current strain‚Ä¶3)  Politicians who advocate for freedoms get my vote‚Ä¶ not for pointless vaccines‚Ä¶
109647	@notmytruename @grahamjf @CryanGrim @Akustronique @DrEliDavid 2) Polio's behaviour is not even comparable to a corona-virus. Due to high genetic drift, you will a lot of mutations. This will render you vaccine way less effective after half a year or a year. Same as influenza. Other coronavirus' like SARS (IFR 11%) and MERS (IFR 35%)..

108477	With what's happening with the #coronavirus, and the suspicion that it's an accidental leak of a vaccine virus from a BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan, we need an impartial governing body to oversee all hazardous research matters in all countries. #nCoV2019 #wuhanconoravirus
110147	Even if you don‚Äôt want the vaccine, that‚Äôs fine. Don‚Äôt take it. This vaccine will shut the mouths of ALL Governors. It gives them no right or way to shut down and hurt their people. Celebrate this fact even if you will never touch the vaccine. #COVID19 #Thegreatawakening
109278	Everybody get caught up in Trumps spin-offs. How can we send kids to schools when there is no vaccine or medicines for #coronavirus which has already killed over 130,000 people in America. The conversation is laughable. Trump needs to answer for Putin paying 4hits on our soldiers

109688	Covid-19 vaccines helped you not get the Covid-19 FLU for 6 to 9 months when we were told it would keep us from getting  Covid-19. Now, a booster it needed.
108823	@PunjabGovtIndia #coronavirus It seems sm people become immune to Coronavirus as they started taking morning &amp; evening walks without masks, elderly taking kids to play out, no social distancing.Isn't it too soon to give up masks and social distancing measures.@kbssidhu1961 @capt_amarinder
111099	Why are you using a bird costume to spread a vaccine rhetoric? This is pathetic. I can‚Äôt wait till you end up in a KFC bucket you foolish bird
108488	@bkblk @melodramax_ @EricFielding @GEMI__NI This case is different, since they already have vaccines for other types of coronavirus to work with. As well, basically every vaccine lab globally is working on it. So, yeah, it‚Äôll be much faster to develop a vaccine for covid19
110135	Meanwhile, in the UK doctors get kick back for every Rona vaccine, but only after the second dose.  This is where America would be, and maybe heading, if we don't #StopTheSteal
109200	"Let me get this right, China has the audacity to boast itself being the so called ""fore-front of the world"" in obtaining a vaccine for the devastating coronavirus that they created. Interesting dilemma ü§î indeed."
110536	Isn‚Äôt it funny how I‚Äôm a TEACHER and I‚Äôm barley being offered the vaccine. I‚Äôve been going to in person class for MONTHS. There have been positive cases at my school and I‚Äôm just exposed. I have never tested positive and I just think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been LUCKY.

111290	@DoHSocial @SEHAHealth any danger of someone letting me know if I‚Äôve had the vaccine or placebo as a volunteer in the #COVID19 trials? I was told 2 weeks ago that the results are being released........ still nothing.... I just want to know if I‚Äôm protected or not #4Humanity
108260	Why are some vaccines getting more negative press than others? Pretty sure they‚Äôre all equally untested and bad for us. Is it to give the appearance that the ones they don‚Äôt criticise are safe? ü§î
108216	Whoa....I‚Äôm so sad my family have and will get the vaccine. I warned them. I asked them not to. I had to let it go.

112230	@MatthewJshow @JoeBiden Of course there is. WHO literally admitted that the PCR tests are creating false positives so how are they so confident in a vaccine that they don‚Äôt even know will stop coronavirus from spreading? As of recent, they have only been testing the vaccine to see if it has any side ...
108089	@TimetoactOne @Trumptweets2020 FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus.

112519	In fairness; if Tories had cracked testing and PPE, then had a separate team focusing on drugs and vaccines I would get that. The chaotic way they‚Äôve approached this is pure mismanagement and incompetence. Listening to Trump (?? bleach) is a clear symptom of this #JohnsonMustGo

111553	@MaddowBlog No matter what we do to curb the novel coronavirus‚Äîwhether through social distancing, wearing masks, or developing a vaccine‚Äîone thing is certain: This virus is never going away.
112319	Can't get vaccinated yet, still broke until I can apply for the Cares Act &amp; get money for us next month but we need these vaccines, everyone does.
108535	This idea that we are ever going to ‚Äúcontain‚Äù COVID-19 without a vaccine is fanciful. The only way to truly contain this virus without a vaccine is to keep everyone quarantined in their homes indefinitely which we all know is not realistic and has its own disastrous pitfalls.
108046	My Coronavirus Vaccine Predictions:1. Trump will not directly mandate the vaccine, but won't stop it either.2. Mandates will come at state level. If you're in CA or NY, get out now! All states will jump on the bandwagon eventually.More&gt;
109570	@john606sc @Waccoe1919 No one is shouting, John. It isn‚Äôt certain that people could catch COVID-19 if they don‚Äôt have a vaccine, that is utterly ridiculous to suggest such a thing.

112203	The only way this won't occur is if the virus magically disappears and there is no second or third waves.  Will there be safe vaccine for this?  Well there has never been a safe vaccine for a coronavirus.

202314	Delighted that my wife, a healthcare worker, just received her #COVID19 vaccine. However, she‚Äôs acting very strangely now and won‚Äôt stop talking about the benefits of Microsoft Azure  üôÉ
202234	I wish this was available for my grandpa in FL who is unable to take the long drive and wait in line to get his vaccine. Well done NYC.
109624	"Though it hit the minimum requirement, it still remains to have the lowest efficacy rate among the vaccines available so far. Why settle for less if we can go for a vaccine with higher efficacy? Stop the ""Okay na yan"" mindset. Filipinos deserve better!"
110825	"@thewebbix @BeverlyGochano1 @realDonaldTrump They can ""practice"" on someone else.That includes early vaccines, unless I get sick #coronavirus.I know it's necessary for people to do this so we can get a vaccine,but it just won't be me."
109912	this is a relief but it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre safe without the vaccine. would rather take off my mask once the vaccines are available.
109958	Everything is about race with these people. We will never move past any of this if they can never let it go. I want everyone to be taken care of. Remember, it‚Äôs not Trump who would administer the vaccine, it‚Äôs up to the states.
111053	"""Q: We still don't have a vaccine for HIV. Why should we be optimistic about a vaccine for #COVID19?A: People have had some immunity as antibodies have neutralized the virus. We're not clear how long that lasts, but this is a good sign that a vaccine can work.""@DukeMargolis"
110747	Why only 40+, why isn't the AZ being used to protect all people in hotspots? There's a million vaccines in the freezer right now, and even if they were all AZ (which they're not), they should be moved to wherever they're most needed in Ontario.
108644	My employer has explicitly stated, in both verbal and written form that getting the vaccine would be grounds for dismissal. I value my job, I get to do whatever I want and its paying me more than the guberment and the world economic forum combined.
109444	If anyone has immunity - it‚Äôs health care providers and no one should be forced to get the jab and belittled because they don‚Äôt. Just my opinion.
109573	@AldrinSampear #bth #vaccine I have my own believe that the covid19 vaccine has been developed  long time together with the virus same as the virus testing kit ,first proof is no country was requested and yet prohibited to manifacture the vaccine. this was a succesful PLANdemic
112818	This person in this picture had COVID-19 the one thing I will say is don‚Äôt mess with this virus it does mean business take my word if you are not vaccinated please get your vaccine because I think my vaccine help me get through it it could‚Äôve been worse for me
111013	Which do you think will make you more renowned?  1. Discovering the cure to Coronavirus or  2. Finding the vaccine for it?
108394	@Jman1900Jul @BenRothenberg Great math. Since #vaccine is avaliable world wide, did it or did it not reduce severe #COVID19 and mortality? As I saw working in #Hospitals, and as far you can read in any #relevant news it DID. Nobody said you wont get sick, but you wont end in hospital or die! #FactsMatter
110149	I really think I have the coronavirus I need to get tested. And even if I have it, what happens? There is no vaccine lol
109763	We in the United States-- unlike in say China-- are SO FORTUNATE that we have people like #PresidentTrump, #JaredKushner, dear #Ivanka, #MitchMcConnell in charge when a #COVID19 vaccine is found, becoz they will bust ass to make certain everyone is able to get it.FOR FREEEEE.
112899	SA‚Äôs cabinet and it‚Äôs ministers is a big fat joke. When covid-19 hit Italy and other developed countries they said they were ready for it but now they are busy pushing an untested vaccine for us humans what a great country we have.
109021	Would you take any of the COVID-19 vaccines if you had  opportunity?If yes, why? If no, why?Share with me your thoughts.
112609	@eddiemiller9000 @D1Bluebird @lewis_goodall I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd need to do extra testing to have a good idea of that, if the new variant has the same spike protein as the old ones (which all variants of COVID-19 seem to have) then the vaccine would lead to the same outcome as it would trigger the same immune response
201955	@musicisarainbow Just be prepared to feel cruddy after the 2nd dose. I need to get a Tetanus shot as well. I'm Trying to get it all done before the Covid-19 vaccine. Did you do a flu shot? I got mine in September.
108470	@Beka49707658 @PPutricide @R_H_Ebright You‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges. Firstly, yes, get the vaccine. Secondly, Fauci donates $ to Wuhan lab that admitted they did, indeed, use that $ for gain of function with the novel coronavirus. Not good.
109787	It takes years to develop a vaccine. They've never developed one for common colds &amp; flu in decades but they've got one within months of #COVID1984 ?Those 2 million will be the lucky ones.
109514	"Laurie, 1) You are awesome2) Are there any studies on the vaccines in regards to preventing COVID damage to cells that cause stroke, heart attack, etc.? We obviously don't know ""long term"" damage COVID will have. But will COVID create ""preexisting conditions""?"
108137	I am NOT an anti-vaxxer but I have no plans to get the coronavirus vaccine soon. I don't trust big pharma ( always out to make money at any cost) and I sure as hell don't trust Trump with my life. I'll wait a few months and wear a nice safe mask.
109604	@JanVanMulders3 @TheBioTrader Dude it‚Äôs the only stock under $1 with a coronavirus vaccine in the works, all other popped, this is a no brainer man
108337	Moderna vaccine, or any of the mRNA platform based vaccines, produce immunity that last only three months. So, I can‚Äôt continue vaccinating myself every quarter (I.e.reprogramming my cells to produce coronavirus like spike proteins).Whatever happened to AstraZeneca vaccine!
109344	...van den Bossche, and other renowned and recognized virologists are saying.  And a) There has never been a successful leaky vaccine, not against coronavirus nor any other virus, that has ended a pandemic or wiped out a disease.  b) All coronaviruses ever tried...
111714	@JeremyVineOn5 Yes it is. My son got covid19 in school from his teacher then we all got it in November my partner still has no taste &amp; smell I'm still suffering with a cough.Teacher's should be getting the vaccine they too are front line worker's.
201956	@RepSwalwell I can‚Äôt sleep for long period I feel tired. I can't imagine getting worse with another dose of COVID-19 MANDATORY vaccine! My Asthma has been mild to acute; mild to acute allergies &amp; this has been my reaction (although it was delayed and not immediate) to the Pfizer Covid vaxs.
202168	"@DohenyDarren @harrymcgee @IrishTimes But that still doesn't make the sentence ""Almost 25% of population has received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine"" right."
108775	I fear this is just the beginning of the outrages in how the vaccine is going to be rolled out in this country. Thinking of pressure that truly heroic state public health officials trying to operate in our brutally unequal and unjust system will be under.
108363	@Channel4News ‚Äúscientist‚Äù claiming Covid19 herd immunity should be the strategy, when most scientists know that is only possible with vaccine. If you don‚Äôt like lockdowns etc, then *eliminate* the virus. That has proven to work in China, SK, HK, NZ...
110602	@Martinhood15 @boyscout123456 @ECUProfessor Not only that but Covid19 is fairly new to ad where as the flu has been around for ages AND there are vaccines. We can‚Äôt compare this to the regular flu yet.
112311	Think again please and do more research. Gate vaccine is poison and evil. Bad ingredients and secret ingredients. This is a bad idea.
109879	You know, when I called this back in Feb I was half joking. I don't mind being a little carful about any new vaccine coming out. It's rushed so there could be issues IF we even get one. But why go out into the streets in large numbers to protest a thing we don't even have yet?
109708	Just to state what many don't realize: there is no COVID-19 vaccine. There is a medical treatment, but it does not give you COVID-19 immunity (which is what a vaccine does). This is the single biggest medical experiment on live subjects in human history, but it is not a vaccine.
110064	@MzAllieOsin1 If the vaccine doesn't prevent you from Covid-19 illness, just as the flu shot doesn't prevent everyone from getting flu, what the fk are you saying. For fk sake their in the cab of a truck, not going to concerts and clubs.
111735	@James09302000 @AntonioSabatoJr How many vaccines have been made and were successful in treating any coronavirus in the past 100 years? Zero. What makes anyone believe that all of a sudden they can whip one up this time in a few short months? Don't be dumb.
108791	It certainly is getting worrisome here out West. My thoughts always go to frontline HCPs and my old ER buddies. Stay safe. Stay strong #COVID19BC. Vaccines can‚Äôt come fast enough!
111720	@stephenpollard My surgery said that the vaccines they're using now were ordered last year using estimated figures. Covid-19 has thrown a big spanner in the works. I had mine as an over 65 y/o today, we're the last batch. More vaccine is expected in November. They're doing their best.
111277	Underlying the Government's assumptions is that a coronavirus vaccine won't be in place until late next year at the earliest. It expects Australians will have to live with social-distancing until a vaccine is fully rolled out. #auspol  üò≠üò©
109842	Jab me up and get me to craven park @hullkrofficial couldnt care less if bill gates wants to watch aswell
202354	@CV_UHB Many thanks to everyone involved in the Covid-19 Booster jab roll-out. I had mine completed today &amp; my gratitude goes out to you all. üëçüëç
202190	@JKJAVMY @Khairykj Dear, I have taken my 1st dose AZ vaccine during 1st batch on 7th May, if I can get my 2nd dose AZ within 8-12 weeks in Germany (also AZ vaccine) hospital, will you recognize me as complete full vaccination, issue covid-19 digital certificate (in MySejahtera)??
112240	@LilUziBert99 @CallMeDave97 If you eat filet o fish don‚Äôt worry about what‚Äôs in the coronavirus vaccine
107792	Just because you had covid last year doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt need the vaccine. The Delta variant is not to be trifled with. Get the shot üëáüëá
109713	I'm polling folks I know from different backgrounds about their views on the Coronavirus vaccines, how important it is for them and if they will take it.Results in the thread below. Will keep adding responses through the day along with profile of person (w/o personal details)
110388	@LoneSucculant @crowngaurav Idiot! üò°There is covid's vaccine in Dubai? Well, i don't think so. I'm trying to say Brazil have a lot of people who don't care about coronavirus too and don't protect they selves
202213	This is why I‚Äôve decided to get my second dose and eventually a booster despite having had it July 2020 (and first vax May 2021). I‚Äôd rather be safe and I no longer buy the ‚Äúyou‚Äôve had it so don‚Äôt need to get double jabbed.‚Äù
111704	@scotconant @Timcast What is there to understand ? 1) The vaccine is not a vaccine, but a gene therapy injection. 2) kids are practically IMMUNE to covid19 3) if old people are scared, they can get VACCINATED to be protected. 4) Vaccines are experimental ! Wake up, will you ?
108605	@collette_books @michaelvkim So a vaccine like the flu vaccine that is only for strains that came out one to two years prior, yet the virus will mutate on a regular basis?  So does this mean we are going to have to get a new coronavirus vaccine every year, for the strain from the year prior?
111629	Good info on Idaho's vaccine distribution plan. I'm glad to take last place in line in order for these folks to get the vaccine first.
112688	this dude sounds like an idiot. he does realize the vaccine has been in production for a minute this isn't the first coronavirus we've seen.
112673	I feel so privileged to have received my first vaccine today üôÇ so I will be twinning my vaccine and supporting @UNICEF_uk in their campaign to ensure everyone has a fair chance of being protected from Covid-19 üò∑ #GiveTheWorldAShot
108007	People who never get sick because they have a robust immune system take vaccines under coercion, which by definition pisses about with the immune system, suddenly have problems with their immune system. How is this whole vaccine thing even a debate?
109883	@MagpieGazzT @Carla_littlerob @GOVUK Coronavirus‚Äô are generally common colds - incredibly easily spread but very mild so we don‚Äôt need a vaccine to protect us.The issue with this coronavirus therefore is it is highly contagious BUT now deadly too .... &amp; we don‚Äôt have any population vaccine protection!
110600	And what?? There‚Äôs tones of variations of the flu but you just take your yearly jab and get on with it, I get why this is important but it‚Äôs put across in a way that feels like pure fear mongering
110668	This is infuriating. Also seems self-owning for anti-vaxxers to prevent people who want to get the vaccine from getting it. You want mask mandates, social distancing, lockdowns etc. to end then they should be encouraging people who *want* the vaccine to go get it.
108944	"""@realDonaldTrump What Azar appears to be saying is that a coronavirus vaccine, once it is developed, will be left to the private marketplace rather than to government procurement. Private businesses, """"will actually sort out the demand, purchasing, stocking, etc."""""""
111287	Omg they have just confirmed that this J&amp;J vaccine causes the immune system to attack the nervous system! And they‚Äôre exporting it!!!
110099	#NoVaccinePassports - I‚Äôll fully boycott all vaccine passport venues/businesses, even if they support it now then change in future, I‚Äôll never darken their door again with my business or orders. Is there a data base or group going with a list? Let's put them in 2 tiers instead!
108004	Bill Gates does not want to admit that the Coronavirus is DEAD and EVERYBODY is testing POSTIVE for the ANTIBODIES that KILL the VIRUS. Bill Gates wants to KEEP the VIRUS and FEAR ALIVE so that he can make MONEY on the VACCINES and FLU SHOTS that he will produce next year.
112772	So it‚Äôs not ready yet, but he already knows it won‚Äôt be very effective. Sounds a lot like the flu vaccine. In a typical year you have 25-50% efficacy.Why bother?  If you want it, get it, but no reason to force everyone to get it.

110116	COVID-19 does not exist. No one needs to wear a face covering, socially distance, self isolate, or get the so-called vaccine.
108099	They openly say the vaccine doesn't stop the spread or protect you. It has fucking jellyfish in it so they can see it glow in the dark. It's a psyop.
108659	@cedarproduct Airbags work; I still put a seatbelt on when I get in a car.Vaccines significantly reduce the risk of illness and death, they don't eliminate it completely. Never have, and never will. Our vigilance must be proportional to the risk presented. Covid-19 is deadly and contagious.
112513	@CP24 Not a chance got my 1st dose of the vax and my face went numb and I still don‚Äôt have feeling back on my left cheek. I also have tingling in my fingers  and arm. Went and got it checked and the doctor doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong but attributed it to the #vaccine #COVID19
110666	Lmaooo how are Republicans upset about who gets the vaccine and in what order when coronavirus is a made up pandemic to them? I'm lost...
109673	After hearing that federal staff is being forced to get the Covid-19 vaccine in order to work and public businesses incentives to get the vaccine.  If you are interested in knowing what your legal rights are send me a message and I will get you the information that will help you
112347	@DaveOshry I genuinely wanna immigrate to NZ if there's no coronavirus vaccine, please write me a letter of recommendation (I think that's how it works)
112658	@BrianKohler2 @MzSha79 @ChancellorTV That's exactly what he said. He never specified with what or against what.The vaccine doesn't stop the virus. It reduces the symptoms. The virus is called SARS-Cov-2The vaccine deals with COVID-19 which is the symptoms not the virus
110140	Ok so, they can‚Äôt give teenage girls Midol in school for cramps but they can get vaccines in elementary üòÇüòÇ
112726	@GPrime85 @ooana We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.
109384	@thehill Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
110257	Herd immunity is arriving.  Fauci and the rest who were hoping for a windfall from those vaccines are going to be pissed. @mitchellvii
202054	Just finish playing Dr. Vee. Not my staff calling  me to complain of pain on the Covid19 vaccine spot and having funny feelings ü•¥ no one told me being HR comes with Doc role play.
110902	"@NotAlexSheppard I know loads, but they don't call it ""Flu"" anymore 'cos the WHO recommended 75% uptake of flu vaccine has only been hit twice in 21yrs. So they renamed it covid-19 and quickly developed a new vaccine which they are pushing for everybody to take üòè"
110020	My fellow Arkansans and Americans more widely, please get the COVID vaccine. If pro-economy is your thing, then do so to avoid another shutdown. If pro-life is your thing, then do so to protect our kids. #Arkansas
111133	@Teensthack @HospitalsApollo @HospitalsApollo they are Delhi biggest chor in health services. It's not just about vaccines even in normal days they treat people like customers not like patients. #COVID19
111573	And here we go.Watch as they roll out the vaccine passports, and I continue to not get one.I'll live in an earthen hut on the edge of society, and it still won't be good enough for the feds.  It wasn't good enough for them when the Weavers did it, and Ruby Ridge happened.
201895	Can‚Äôt raise my right arm because it hurts so much, and it feels like I have a light cold, but otherwise those are the ‚Äúworse‚Äù post vaccine symptoms so far. I‚Äôll take it! #COVID19 #covidvacccine
108138	They may want to stop reporting this if they want people to be vaxxed. This further makes the point that the vaccine does not stop spread. Now with symptoms lesser why does everyone need a shot that doesn‚Äôt work.
111134	Do you love baseball and not dying?Head to an @ABQTopes game! @NMDOH is giving out vaccines in the stadium! If you get the shot you get FREE tickets to a future game! There are not many chances to get vaccinated while drinking a $12 beer - don't miss this unique opportunity!
111867	@MLevitt_NP2013 @TheLancet I‚Äôm glad at this time in society we‚Äôre just calling out all the BS as we see it. I wonder how skewed these ‚Äúdeath toll‚Äù numbers from COVID-19 really are, and why after a few short months is there hope for a vaccine THIS year? Too many in answered questions. It‚Äôll come out tho.
110840	@realDonaldTrump Why don't you help by starting the transition to Biden who  will take the Coronavirus seriously and actually help America get out of this Pandemic, instead!!??  Battling the coronavirus is more important now,  The vaccines are not released yet a$$hole
108335	irl is not very smart. she thinks they are making a cure for coronavirus rn. ma‚Äôam. they‚Äôre making a vaccine. she insists no no no not the vaccine they‚Äôre making a cure. MAAM. you CANT CURE A VIRUS.
109166	@districtai @CDCgov The only bright side is they have to stop treating unvaxed as second class citizens. Now that vaxed spread Covid-19 too, they can't guilt us into getting the vaccine to save others. No reason to mandate the vaccine. People can decide for themselves if they need the vaccine.
107827	"@WayneDupreeShow Nope. Not taking a vaccine for this coronavirus. Might refuse to take a vaccine ever again if they all start including ""tracking"" chips or 'digital tattoos'."
112209	@4dmbrown @mi6rogue @BorisJohnson It does prevent infection. It‚Äôs an effective vaccine that will protect someone who receives it by lowering the chance of getting COVID-19 if the person encounters the coronavirus.
111691	You couldn't invent corruption like this. Trump buys Moderna vaccine after a member of their board just happens to resign before the contract award and is involved in the selection process...
202060	Timely. I was recently reminded to check the coverage for vaccine side effects also by my friend.Please do, you guys :)
107765	Biden is actually moving like COVID-19 vaccine- not following the process.Presidents need 4 years to select their cabinet.
110038	so let me get this right, we are quick to develp a vaccine for corona but still no proper cure for cancer after all these years! ü§îüò≠ #coronavirus
111612	@hivetosurvive @NHSEngland @RoyalLondonHosp @CliveMyrieBBC If you use my theory it explains 5-11sMy theory is we been weakened by flu jabs containing coronavirus or bird flu or H5N1 ur pick but are all the same5-11 only have nasal spray not jabbedSo they have very little recievers in them
107699	Omicron is as contagious as measles &amp; mumps but I've never known anyone to have either of them thanks to actual vaccines providing immunity like vaccines do. Will we EVER get an actual vaccine for Covid-19 so we can stop the spread? The current shot is not it.
108990	Big testing numbers and also even bigger weekend vaccine administrations. Thanks for getting tested or a shot.I know it's tough times at the moment but we can still get through this.Do #GetVaccinated very soon if you're eligible but haven't done so.#COVID19VIC
110552	We are in an amazing position to overcome Covid19 because of what the President did to get these vaccines developed. He moved mountains. Yet, Dems will not give him credit and neither will the antivaxer Trumpers. Complete ingratitude.
201991	swachhbharat: RT @narendramodi: Took my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at AIIMS. Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against COVID-19. I appeal to all those who are eligible to take t‚Ä¶ https://t.co/QCtkJiEdz3

112589	#Moderna‚Äôs stock has gone from $18.23 on Feb 21st to $80.57 on May 18th. That sinking feeling you have might be because they are running a ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù scheme? Time will tell if their vaccine is real or just hype. #Covid19 #coronavirus #TrumpVirus #CoronaOutbreak

111993	@Citizen004 Would this only apply to COVID-19 vaccines? If so, why? Would it stop at vaccines? Sorry, you can‚Äôt come in, I think your might have HIV, can you prove you don‚Äôt? Sorry, that cold sore tells me you have herpes, can‚Äôt risk you coming in!
111999	There is no vaccine for SARS after seventeen years and there is no vaccine for MERS seven years on. These are two strains of Coronavirus. So it is highly unlikely that there will be a vaccine for SARS-COV-2 which leads to COVID-19.

111750	@ALGhammer Meanwhile the Netherland are starting a lawsuit against the lock downs and the manditory vaccine. Stating 89-94% of PCR are false positive and they now know Covid-19 is just a normal flu. Nothing to worry about. Keep an eye on this.
109658	If there‚Äôs any chance of controlling this until a proven vaccine is actually viable then that is to shut the international borders, keep them ALL closed, that‚Äôs why other countries have managed to do better! @cafreeland @NDP @liberal_party @RosieBarton @EvanLSolomon #COVID19
108604	A sub-point I am thinking about talking about is how there has been some research done that getting the Covid-19 vaccine messes with some people's reproductive systems. This could be a scary fact for some young girls debating on if they are going to get the vaccine or not.
108926	"somewhere out there someone is being woken up by the mike pence taking the coronavirus vaccine push notification from twitter saying ""i don't give a fuck about that cracker"""
109666	Question? If vaccines are going to soon be updated to include protection (potentially) from a new variant, why would you rush out and get the old version and then not be protected? That‚Äôs like getting an old iPhone when the new ones just come out no? ü§Ø #COVID19
111490	@JasonMillerinDC Yes Jason;Of course you'd have to take into account no one wants you to be successful.  Half your voters don't support an Coronavirus intervention.Its amazing you've decided to wear masks.Why not volunteer to skip the vaccine?These vaccines are despite Donald Trump.

109995	My background is in science. ‚ÄúNovel‚Äù COVID-19 virus currently has no cure, no treatment, no vaccine. COVID-19 is currently transmitted in 68% of cases by extended families showing NO SYMPTOMS! Each person transmits to 2-38 people. Do you have children? Do you want responsibility?
110455	"Why doesn't @kroger assume the liability for any adverse effects from the ""safe &amp; effective"" jab if they think that all employees should have it? Penalizing unvaccinated customers will be next. The gates they've been installing in the store entries aren't for show. #Agenda2030"
111482	@inquirerdotnet @KAguilarINQ this sinofarm vaccine, it would seem they have this false sense of security that it will protect them from covid19, I suspect he got already vaccinated since he has been going around the country as if he is virus proof. digong would probably go back to hiding after this.
110835	Do you want to be that person who infects their entire family with the coronavirus, resulting in long term damage, and possibly lose a love one, months before a vaccine is available????Stay home. Thanksgiving will be here again next year. But your love one might not be.
202064	I received the two-dose Moderna vaccination for #COVID19 and the booster and with all three shots I did not have any side-effects.  I wish the best for all of you out there getting innoculated.  Peace to you all. üéÑ #FridayMotivation

111242	@Gaylilintrovert @POTUS It my duty to take a vaccine I am not confident is safe to protect anyone. If you are concerned about Covid19 and want the vaccine- go get it. If everything is as it should be. Me getting the vaccine is irrelevant because you have it.
108356	Your un-aided immune system defends the human body like a home owner with a set of steak knives. They'll get the job done, maybe, but things are going to get messy.Vaccines are the 2A of the immune system. Providing your body with an arsenal of weapons.
111607	Puhsuhnally I want all the diff vaccines available so I cud get super powers no cap...if it works like that in fiction why not real life eh
109732	These are scarier times and getting scarier. ICE is transporting kids to coronavirus hot spots, trump told governors to find their own medical supplies, Big Pharma forced congress to make a bill saying there is no limit to their income from any future vaccine. Is this real life?
110611	@TheRightMelissa Otherwise they don't have to create the vaccine to achieve their goal bcz the covid19 will do it.
107691	In our stake leadership meeting, the stake president just organized a 48 hour initiative to have every person within our stake boundaries aged 70 and up registered for an appointment to receive the COVID-19 vaccine sometime during the next two weeks, if they so desire. (Utah Cty)

110641	2) Humanitarian aid is important one but the question is ‚Äòhow‚Äô? The long delay of COVID-19 vaccine distribution is because regime want to directly handle it and they want to legitimize itself.
112450	This event would be more worthwhile if we threw it open to everyone who wants a booster/third dose to get one. The JCVI have ok‚Äôd it, so get on with it.

107876	@vonderleyen There's no post-covid world in sight until W.T.O. member countries change their laws so that companies could produce generic versions of any coronavirus vaccines and Covid-19 treatments.
110213	COVID-19 vaccines, like flu shots, don‚Äôt work as well for new strains of the virus.  For that, you will need perpetual immunization, say vaccine makers.
110980	This is great. They (quietly) rolled it out a month or two ago and I‚Äôve been using it as my vaccine record when I go places since. Highly recommend because it‚Äôs *so* simple and comes directly from the DOH.
108464	Everyone is so surprised about the #DeltaVariant but this is literally how viruses work. You make a vaccine, and the virus mutates. Repeat.The coronavirus is going to have to become part of our general pool of viruses, like the flu
108715	@News24 1. Realistically, how far away is a vaccine to Coronavirus?2. How long is it until South Africa would inline to get it?3. What percentage of the population would need to have recieved it before its unclassified as pandemic?
109308	‚¨áÔ∏è We must limit our movement if we want to limit the virus. Just until we get the vaccines rolled out. We can all do this.
110173	My COVID-19 vaccine is almost ready. We will first test it in AFRICA and if it works they will get it for free because they can't afford to buy any.

The disconnect is appalling! Here 25% brainwashed want no shot!
112029	Or all the medical/research communities could share findings to help create a vaccine together? Lmao I HOPE someone else gets a vaccine before we do so y‚Äôall can understand that sometimes everyone needs help ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
107787	Its crazy how hard these guys are working to deny Trump any credit even AFTER the election.I didn't vote for him but he did get the vaccine part of this right.  We are on pace to have a vaccine far faster than estimates.If you don't want it, I'll take your place in line.

108037	@rarelyused123 @samanthamarika1 I never said I was anti- vaccine.  I'm up to date on all my vaccinations.  If you can make a coherent argument for why I should get this COVID-19 vaccine, I'll listen.  Please include studies, numbers, and statistics.I'll wait.
108562	This is the difference between China and USA. China wants the world to have access to any vaccine. USA wants its private pharmas to have patents so they can make money, maximise prices ensuring poor countries have no access. Which do you honestly prefer? #Covid_19
109235	@KassandraKitson The Coronavirus vaccine is the seasonal flu shot but with an added microchip the size of a pepper flake. They never said it would work nor does it have to work. A digital global currency is the goal of the elite.
109721	@jonfarquhar1 @PereginusD @Pammd6 @JaneMorganNZ1 @viewspotnz The common cold is a coronavirus, yet no vaccine has ever been developed to prevent it. Why? Because it's a moving target with new variants being its only constant. Sound familiar? The current crop of approved jabs would not deliver me any benefit.
111958	@PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell @RepDerekKilmer @RepJayapal I will definitely wait for my vaccine if it meant those in prison get it, first.
108472	@Melcatzzzz @Danza109 This is why I was strong on vaccines. No kid should be without a parent if a vaccine is available. I understand a genuine phobia but speak to your doctor is my advise.

See the difference?
112635	@dinotalkspol @BreitbartNews Because nobody receiving the coronavirus vaccine believes in God. So Muslims shouldn‚Äôt get the vaccine? Should they pray it away too?

108963	Billions more likely.And their stock was tanking until everyone wanted their vaccine.They've made a killing while millions have died.If airports were closed so the different variants weren't spread, it would have ended the pandemic#COVID19
112007	@adamseconomics @DanielAndrewsMP It‚Äôs all about the $$$$$, if hydroxychloroquine can be used to treat Coronavirus then there won‚Äôt be a need for a vaccine, and we all know Big Pharma wants a vaccine because that‚Äôs the Big $$$$$, so why is #DanAndrews banning it?.#COVID19Vic,
108053	@KUSINews Very sad ... the misconceptions about the Covid-19 vaccines!  Why?  Because once you have taken the vaccine you can still get Covid and you can still spread the illness if you get it!  That simple!
202452	This is not related to GOT7 but I just got my second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. Now I‚Äôm officially vaccinated.What a great day‚ú®
112523	C'mon @markknoller, dude. There is no vaccine. It's irresponsible to parrot what Trump's minions say without also noting that it's total BS. There is no vaccine. It's not hard. There is no vaccine.
110277	.@MontgomeryCoMD @MoCoCouncilMD @MontCoExec Please consider this study (&amp; others) when contemplating vaccine mandates. Everyone does not need a vaccine -- natural immunity is quite valid.
112697	@NYDailyNews The Chinese Communists are only good at copying, not smart or quick enough to create a good Covid-19 vaccine for the virus that they originally created in the Wuhan Lab, then released into the world.
112317	@PaulSorrentino3 Why would they bother when the vaccine does not prevent them from getting Covid19, and it enhances their chances of spreading it?
110913	I am no defender of the Russian state but why did they have to attempt to hack this?If ever there was something all the major powers could work together on, pooling expertise and resources, it‚Äôs a COVID vaccine?
202327	I got the second COVID-19 vaccine shot yesterday. Kicking my butt a little harder than expected this morning.No regrets. Trying not to be a baby about it, but I'll probably spend most of the day in bed.
109523	This is the New York Post so üòí but anyway, the 3 people didn‚Äôt get very sick which is exactly what the vaccine does and they didn‚Äôt get anyone else sick. So the vaccine worked.
109781	I sort of figured this would be the way of it for a while. I mean, the vaccine doesn‚Äôt absolutely stop you from catching and spreading the virus. If you have enough antibodies, you might not contract it or get it more mildly, but a mild case is enough to spread it to unprotected.
112289	"@GOPLeader I get a flu shot every year and have never gotten the flu. However, I'm not going to take this ""fast tracked"" vaccine until it's been properly tested. Testing takes time especially to verify that there are no side effects that could be worse than Coronavirus."
110891	@DrTedros @hagegeingob @WHO @WHONAMIBIA @MoHSSNamibia If the advanced economies of the world do not liberate COVID-19 vaccine patents for 3 YEARS, the pandemic will return with a vengeance to all nations, including the vaccinated ones. It's like this virus has AI. It adapts and takes advantage of humanity's errors, in record time.
111869	@magnoliafarm @Thomas1774Paine First, there is the flawed PCR test. Then, there are scientists who say that anyone one who received a flu vaccine in the past will test positive for the viral fragments they are claiming to be attributable to the coronavirus.
109729	Just phoned the doctors surgery today to ask about the vaccine, they haven't got a clue about it and don't know when it will be rolled out.  Where is the Oxford vaccine and when will it be available? We are dying out here.
109047	Science to the rescue. I also remain optimistic philanthropist will work out a way to get the good vaccine to poorer countries. Not all is doomed.
111747	@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Yes I am scratching my head. If it‚Äôs all a hoax then  why require a vaccine for COVID-19 ,or if it is a little flu or it is fading. This proved that Trump has been lying all the time, bigly
111665	@realDonaldTrump Hey,  So heads up.... I wasn‚Äôt allowed to say anything until today, but it's now okay for me to share that I volunteered for the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer. The vaccine is the one that has been developed in Russia. It is in 6 different stages and I received my first dose 1/2
111729	In Japan, the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for people aged 65 and older until after mid-April.However, most people with underlying medical conditions and those in their 50s want to get the vaccine as soon as possible, they don't even know when they can get it.
109963	@realDonaldTrump @jimcramer @CNBC These are people going back to work. SLOWLY. There is no guarantee these jobs will stick. No job or life is secure until there is a vaccine for COVID19.People are distracted by the death of George Floyd and the resulting protests. Just know-You didn‚Äôt create these jobs!
109553	@TommyDoc36 Aye you have them well taped whit an attitude once we‚Äôve got a vaccine for Covid19 think we need to see if we can get one for stupidity
111950	I don‚Äôt understand why this is shocking. Even the Global Good Samaritan Gates‚Äô calls for funding vaccine development were peppered with references to capitalism and private profit
108297	"""Seasonal flu is only """"seasonal"""" in the US BECAUSE there is a vaccine.  COVID-19 will burn through the global population again &amp; again until a vaccine is developed. It will infect and reinfect millions each and every year. Won't NEARLY be the last novel Coronavirus either."""
201858	This was a very pleasant experience despite the stadium being woefully difficult for the mobility challenged. Staff were very kind and quick to offer wheelchair assistance, and it wasn‚Äôt very crowded today at all. Our Pfizer jabs were done with expert skill in a few minutes.
202372	Walked into #CVS to return unopened Halloween candy, walked out with a Pfizer COVID-19 Booster Shot. Came home and my college diploma from nearly 6 months ago was sitting on my front step.

109730	@realDonaldTrump WHY ARE YOU NOT BUYING VACCINES FOR THE AMERICAN POPULATION?WHERE ARE THE VACCINES? #COVID19 WHY DID YOU NOT BUT THE VACCINES?
107934	Yes why @POTUS? No vaccine for me.  We already have things that work like our own immune systems if you treat them right plus other therapeutics. I don‚Äôt trust anybody in the pharmaceutical industry.
108038	@Rectitude20 1. I will not take a Covid19 vaccine. 2. I will not take any of today‚Äôs vaccines. 3. There is not one vaccine on the market today that has been proven necessary, safe &amp; effective. 4. I will educate my family &amp; friends as to the truth behind vaccines. please RT.
110886	Seymour questioned why Kiwis may have to wait until March to get a Covid-19 vaccine when the UK plans to roll one out next week. Effective and safe vaccines are very cost-effective health care interventions, which are the great triumphs of modern medicine. We want a safe vaccine.
112574	"@MattHancock @UniofOxford When the present crisis is under control, pls also throw everything you've got at a #crohns vaccine. It ""only"" affects around 2% of the population but for those people (usually immune compromised) it is every bit as life-altering as #COVID19 has been for 100%. Don't stop here!"
109637	@News24 There is not pure truth about this vaccinesEven though it is proven by SAHPRA; however it doesn't guarantee any effectiveness it might have our lives, what I see is that, we'll all take the vaccines shot up until post  COVID-19 Since our government is also turning against us.
108145	@WADeptHealth your PSA calls the #COVID19 gene therapy a ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù. It is NOT a vaccine. Please stop lying to people and call it what it is. Or do YOU not even realize it‚Äôs gene therapy?

111849	I quite fancy getting the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. Not that I care either way which vaccine I eventually get. But I like that this one isn't profiteering as much as the other two.
109042	This is the way to deal with Covid! The masks are not working! The vaccines are not working! Therapeutics like monoclonal antibodies to treat the disease is the way to go!
112237	@JohnCornyn I‚Äôve only had the polio vaccine in my life, I never get the flu, and been around plenty of Covid19... I‚Äôll watch and review first.
110333	This is what they plan 2 turn us all in2.. HUMAN CYBORG ROBOTS!That vaccine they will FORCE us all 2 take will ALTER our DNA forever....
202295	I will not risk my life in Australia for a vaccine apparently targeting a virus that will eventually disappear... If I was elsewhere right now, my decision my be different.QLD has been doing just fine without covid-19 vaccines.
109640	@LSW1261267251 @MailOnline I will decide if and when I want a coronavirus jab, NOT The government! How do I know it is even safe?
108176	If the COVID vaccines are vaccines they would stop you catching it. After all, with a polio vaccine we don‚Äôt still catch polio.
202348	Just before Christmas so they can all go and spread it around at close family gatherings. You have to wonder if this kind of thing is done on purpose to increase cases &amp; justify the push and lockdowns for the next jab. My daughter's friend was one of these poor people.
202015	You‚Äôve got to keep the vaccine at a certain temperature, then get people that first shot in a timely manner, or the product expires. Then get them a second shot 3-4 weeks later. Having identified the best candidates for the vaxx, you have this:
110757	Very useful for everyone who does not want to take the vaccine but is facing increasing pressure from peers and/or family.
107863	I just seen this on ABC. This is has turned into a lottery just to get people to take the vaccine smh.
112473	We all need to work together to protect the world from #COVID19. Will @g20org states please step up and release much needed funds for response efforts to @WHO @CEPIvaccines and @gavi? Together, we can beat this pandemic.
109163	@CharlieMod1 @piersmorgan I‚Äôm not a doctor so I wouldn‚Äôt say. Before you take any please consult your doctor. There‚Äôs no drug or vaccine for Coronavirus so it‚Äôs the doc‚Äôs decision. Trump must be taking that with his personal physician‚Äôs advise
112380	Reading this just makes me want to give up life.And then I think I am not gonna make it easy for you. I am going stay here and fight against this until my last breath.#NoVaccinePassportsAnywhere
110691	I think the question will you get vaccinated for #COVID19 is a bit of a rigged question. I am not against vaccines, &amp; I fall into a high risk category if I were to get #Coronavirus. I want a vaccine, but the question is do I trust the #Trump Admin to deliver a safe vaccine? No!

109634	@KoreyKruse @Rod_Rescueman @AmyAThatcher So why would you want to wait til you get a  viral lung infection like covid19 and take livestock medication for a parasitic intestinal worm when you can take a vaccine made for humans to keep you from ever getting sick in the first place
110700	I get my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow and while I‚Äôm actually super nervous about it, I‚Äôm happy to finally get it done ü•≤
111494	@dotsandloops21 @WGRZ This is an opinion. Even the military doesn‚Äôt want this vaccine. Specifically this vaccine. You people assume we refuse all vaccines. We don‚Äôt. Just the COVID-19 vaccines.

108406	@DavidLammy @BorisJohnson This guy is only thinking in the moment. What will happen if CoVid19 overlaps the flu season?? Realistically, if we're lucky, ll get a vaccine in 18 months (all coronavirus vaccine attempts have failed, so.. finger crossed). So how natural immunisation shouldnt be the main aim?

111766	Amazing what can happen when the scientists are respected and valued. This is an awesome achievement. I just wish my pals in covid vaccine development got the same respect and optimism about their societal contributions.
111352	Get the jab. Boost my vaccine commission. Make me rich.

107829	@realDonaldTrump Definitely but please have virtual sessions until there is #COVID19 vaccine and virus is under control. Kids have great immune but they are even greater careers. I have two elementary kids and opt in for virtual classes.
110711	Is it just the way @Twitter‚Äôs algorithms are working my feed lately, or has the Coronavirus vaccine brought out every whacky ‚Äúanti-vaxxer‚Äù account and shifted them into overdrive?Seriously- the vaccine is ‚ÄúBill Gates Population Control?‚Äù Ya‚Äôll have lost your damn minds.
112302	@MattWalshBlog There will not be a vaccine for Covid19; just like there is not one for HIV, there will only be a course of treatment for COVID like for AIDS.
111590	Imagine your vaccine being so bad that you need to cheat in the second trial after messing up the first one. Literally NOBODY is gonna take this vaccine at this point.
201827	Sign me the fuck up! I've got my first 2 jabs. I live in Tn, these morons are still actively avoiding doing anything about controlling it.
111752	@pdubdev @benshapiro Flu vaccine isn't 100% effective. It depends on strain as the virus mutates. So far we don't think that happens with covid-19 in the same way. Not certain though.
111500	@william20673995 @Hoosiers1986 @DallasTexasMama There is a vaccine for the flu. There‚Äôs no vaccine for the coronavirus. And we are the only country suffering, just look what happened to Italy.
112092	This is so important to discuss! My school told us we have to wait until the vaccine is widely available to the public and get it from our GPs. Yet, my mandatory ED rotation starts next month where I will undoubtedly come into contact with COVID.
112123	"So 90% of 25-34 year olds intend to take the vaccine. With about 80-90% of people needed to take the vaccine for herd immunity.What am I missing here? Is ""herd immunity is looking very likely"" too positive."
108479	@tabitha_mueller Leguen is full of it. My son has a chronic kidney condition and could get the vaccine in almost any other state. Meanwhile, people in Vegas are signing up to do just one uber shift to get it. This is a disgrace. #COVID19 #WorldKidneyDay

112814	@RhubbaComedy @Florence_WHyde It‚Äôs a coronavirus from the same family of viruses that cause the common cold. If you‚Äôve had this vaccine and you believe it‚Äôll give you immunity, then why should you worry about others?

108094	Reckon I got the virus in Kuala Lumpur or Malacca where I was for ten days before the flu jab. But I think it possible the flu jab weakened my immune system to a silent virus - most people who get covid19 have no symptoms. On the plus side I‚Äôve had it so no fear!
108458	@Alex_Neverm1nd @ChingusBingus1 @voiceoflg @BecauseReason11 @RealCandaceO Oh like the flu that has been around since 1912 and was never erraticated because coronavirus can never stop mutations and has had a vaccine for years and are not mandated because they only work 50% got it

109131	"Scientists must stop making false promises like""we are about to make a breakthrough in finding coronavirus vaccine""."
109392	@Miss_Tara_Red @ErisMartinet This is very true and I understand your position.  However, do be aware that there have been no vaccines found for the previous Coronavirus illnesses out there.  I am just hoping you don‚Äôt assume there will be one. A candidate might never be found.
108573	Does this explanation make any sense to anyone?! Or is the FM just making up rubbish excuses... #Wales #Drakeford  #vaccine
202084	@GovBillLee Hey, Guv, my mom just got her COVID-19 Vaccine after waiting......10 minutes. In Iowa. Why does our state have idiots running everything? #dosomework #VaccineStrategy #TN

111367	@MarkieMartin My cousin, thrice vaxxed and a stage 4 breast cancer survivor, was denied ma treatment yesterday after getting a positive Covid-19 diagnosis in NY. Bidens doing. He said if you aren't going help, get out of the way. Biden is the problem. He did this.
111271	I do not mean to offend but have a lot of you seen people messaging about how the Lord apparently told them well done for not taking the Covid-19 vaccine? I had my vaccines done in march and may because I have type 1 diabetes, but in no way is this the mark, agree?
112791	This is some weak ass bullshit. I sat on hold for hours to schedule my vaccine the minute I became eligible, and all I got was a sticker. Where's my gift card? This has college group project vibes written all over it, where the lazy get rewarded and the responsible get nothing.
109217	"Anyone who fights back is risking his life. Courageous Americans still exist. If starvation doesn't kill us the vaccine will, if vaccine doesn't kill us a ""peaceful"" protester will... Gulag USA has begun."
108208	I know that's right.  Who in the hell would take a vaccine named after trump who called Covid-19 a hoax, then said slow down the testing, then refused to get the amount of the vaccines that is needed for the American people.  Get real folks. This circus will soon be over.

108617	@PeterZaitsev Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
107763	Cancer is completely different then a coronavirus, you can't vaccinate for a cold because it's always a mix of different viruses that cause it. HIV is very complex and although we don't have a vaccine we do have treatments to make it almost undetectable.
108525	@celliottability @fordnation @ONThealth 3of us in my household  got our second doses days apart in June - it would be nice to have our boosters done prior to the holidays to keep our youngest protected.  My kids want to be at school in January #onted

108565	Human Trash Box @GovKemp thinks we've been fighting this virus from our living room.  I thought we were socially distancing to flatten the curve and find ways to live/ work until we have a vaccine.  But Trash Box got elected while holding a gun on a teenager, so here we are.
111293	World wide vaccine prices in less price 1 USD enough ! People are poor all over world money purposes vaccine for coronavirus need to remove. Generic vaccine make and give. This will helps world come to normal situations fastly.
110319	So potentially no vaccine, ever and you can catch #COVID19 again and again and again until it 1 day kills you.So pubs will never open, football is gone and we all living on a prison planet.No point in going work, no point in anything really.This just got really bad.

112188	@TheLastPersont2 @RidgeOnSunday @MattHancock You never get full immunity from coronaviruses, this vaccine all all others so far are only to reduce the severity of covid19, lesson the death rates. You will still catch the virus and still transmit the virus after being vaccinated. Lets get this right and we can move forward

109923	This (unevidenced) cautionary tone implies vaccines don‚Äôt work. It undermine other government messages.They‚Äôre trying to be sensible, but they‚Äôre being very reckless. Just give us the good news. Vaccines work and it‚Äôs finally going well. Give people hope, man.
202196	Good Morn Twerps. The Covid-19 Astra Seneca Vaccine is safe. Took it yesterday no adverse reaction. Pls take it let's end covid-19.
109230	Good Morning!It is very wrong for any pastor to advice his members not to take Covid19 vaccines. It should be personal decisions. But, my fear is that this vaccines may not be potent when administered to Nigerians. Can't we develop our own vaccines? #FreedomSquare@solid1009
111095	Well, I don't care if there a vaccine for this horrendous deadly martian disease killing all inhabitants of Earth. I wouldn't take it if there was.But, defund Congress until they allow the re-opening of all States. They are they reason that States are being so restrictive.
110910	@heycrest @AfChloe If you have had the vaccine and you somehow get infected, there will be rapid response to the infection and it'll get eliminated. In intermediate steps, if you do an antibody (AB) test which detects AB against coronavirus, it'll be positive because your body is actively fighting
108524	@SethAbramson The variant in COVID-19 can make you sicker, yes. But the vaccine will still work, it just gives more reason why we need have the vaccine quicker. It is a normal process for any virus to mutate.
111664	@ElectricMiknik @SeamusDuke @coronavirus How are we supposed to live any sort of life until we have a vaccine then. Life is an unnecessary risk and If people don‚Äôt want to incur risk let them isolate if they so wish.
109027	@DanRather This may sound harsh but I think all those elected officials who denied the science regarding COVID-19 should be denied the vaccine if and when it‚Äôs developed.  After all we can‚Äôt deny one science and then support another science it‚Äôs all and nothing
110865	Trump is pushing hard for a vaccine; that's all he or any politician can do since so many Americans have stopped social distancing and mask wearing. Getting haircuts, going to bars and parties, protesting. Americans surrendered to Covid-19 out of selfishness and entitlement.
108131	the only reason they're doing this in the first place is that they realize that the movement to suspend vaccine patents and make them free for any country to manufacture is gaining traction, keep it up
108998	@CNN I will never trust Dr fauci or the vaccine please everyone for your own safety do not take the vaccine the put coronavirus patients in nursing homes to purposely kill a lot of people DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE

111510	#COVID19 #coronavirus #vaccine Dr Fauci saysScientists are hoping for a coronavirus vaccine that is at least 75% effective, but 50% or 60% effective would be acceptable.MY TAKE : 50%-60% is a low bar. The lower the bar the less likely people will take the vaccine
202005	I just received my first COVID-19 shot today. There are so many reasons to get vaccinated and the biggest one is that you‚Äôre worth it! #PennStateHealth #Moderna #modernavaccine https://t.co/vbZnwlsupW

108196	@chrislhayes - COVID-19 is killing hundreds of thousands of people, the vaccine may be the answer, but maybe not, we just don‚Äôt know, but the next pandemic is around the corner. Why not talk about ending animal agriculture instead, this is where the pandemics are coming from!
107921	Have üá¨üáß we given this vaccine out already in our Britain? It appears so.. Then most of them are in that age group, due to our government's priority list.. Do we üá¨üáß need to have a think about this perspective? If there is a merit to their finding, what have we done to üá¨üáß?? ...
108270	@NightmareHolic @eretserus @elonmusk Human herd immunity is the only effective vaccine. It‚Äôs the only way this virus goes away for good. You can only create a vaccine for one strain of this thing at a time. I‚Äôd also love to see any evidence of any vaccine working against any previous coronavirus.
111042	What‚Äôs in the injection?   It‚Äôs not a fragment of ‚Äòcoronavirus‚Äô which can be treated.   It‚Äôs different from a vaccine in that instead of the immune system building immunity to the pathogen..the immune response is to create more of the pathogen if or when encountered again.
112907	A photo Op that is laughable.  I hope I'm wrong, I'm usually not, but this vaccine could spread coronavirus to the point that it could make it worse. The reason I say this is because it mutates quickly.  Will still are so unsure about why it is so powerful and THAT

109380	This probably is not good. Vaccines seems still to be able to work but treatments for infections, less so.
107734	"@margaritaevna95 How will the vaccine ""end"" the pandemic if people who have contracted COVID-19 are getting it again after being officially ""cured"" for weeks? This is a never-ending game we'll just have to accept as the REAL new normal after a certain point, that we can't stop it."
111726	means testing the coronavirus vaccine, if you make 20k or less you get a tax refund worth 50 dollars if you get the vaccine and 5 dollars gets knocked off every 2.5k more you make until you get to 45k in which case you're on your own
108325	"I don't think this is BREAKING, or even surprising.  @FDA has sold us all out to @pfizer.  It would be ""breaking"" if they DIDN'T allow some rushed to production poison with no safety data to be jabbed in american's arms for profit."

109592	@TaurusLondono What it says is the coronavirus was in a bat population, they took that virus, recombined it with another virus for purpose of finding immunotherapy or a vaccine, but failed bc: 1. this new virus mutates too fast, and 2. it‚Äôs immune to practically everything. It was lab-created.
108298	I am no anti vaxer but not interested in #COVID19 vaccine. PM said 3AW he would make it as mandatory as possible, the flu vaccine is not (not once had a shot &amp; never get the flu), why mandate covid? The vaccine is rushed &amp; would prefer to wait 12mths at least.How do others feel?

112669	Not if they get the Delta variant, they can fool the vendors but they can't fool the virus. They pay $50 for a free vaccine. At risk is their life, a $5000 fine or 5 years in prison for every fake vaccine card.The stupidity is STRONG with these people.So does if really work?
111536	Ugh, just asked this question to my BF last night. What if we think it‚Äôs over and we all go back to work and then it just starts up again? Do we need to stay quarantined until a cure/vaccine is found?

110298	@GMB As the vaccine has not been proven to stop transmission of the virus this poll is like GMBtv irrelevant, the vaccine reduces effects of Covid-19 but you can still be asymptomatic &amp; still spread the virus, so those in the vulnerable category should probably take it,
109358	Basic restrictions can't contain the new variant.  Vaccines should still work but we need a complete shutdown.
111679	It's really disappointing how large suburban Philly counties have been short changed on vaccines from the state. It's not because they're not using the shots they have- you can't get an appointment here. I've heard multiple people discussing travelling hours north to get shots.

109236	@SharinStone @te6192 @RepThomasMassie No vaccine can provide 100% protection &amp; they fade just as the anti-bodies you get after catching Covid-19 fade.

109612	@chris_lertora @CBSNews Since Vaccines still keep you from getting the virus, yes they are not 100%, they keep you from spreading the virus. Only if you get COVID-19 you spread it. Therefore vaccination keeps the spread down.
112038	@Milhouse_Van_Ho They just didnt design the trials that way. What they did is pretty logic, they build the trial to find out if the vaccine would prevent covid19 (symptomatic infections). Remember that asymptomatic infections (not sick with covid) are only an issue if you infect someone at risk.
110405	I had Covid-19 last year in November (5 days in the hospital). After that when the county I work for offered the Moderna vaccine. No issues just mild discomfort in the arm!

108500	@GovRonDeSantis When will officials like yourself realize that the COVID-19 fast-tracked vaccine is a Trojan horse. It's not meant to heal!! It is meant to harm! Ask the vaccine creators themselves if they and their families have taken it. I think you will find that they have not. ü§î
111920	@DavidWh22347920 @jkenney Easy answer to that. Max Vaccination and herd immunity only works when the pathogen is slow spreading. In the case if Covid-19 it spreads and mutates so fast in the antivaxxers that there is a HUGE possibility for a moron to be a new patient 0 for a virus that skirts the vaccine.
112023	Now‚Äôs a good time to start talking to the older people in your life and make sure they have all the info so they feel comfortable w/ getting the vaccine! For example: my grandpa said he felt like he‚Äôs made it this long so he probs doesn‚Äôt need it, and we‚Äôre working on that!
110154	News not given by party for good deeds.If you do good things media makes the news. Hope you understand @ArvindKejriwal #AndhraPradesh #COVID19Vaccine Well done @YSRCParty @ysjagan üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
109581	@jason_bane FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus. EVER.
111357	@ilysheezy it‚Äôs actually bc the site over there in Wuhan (?) had put in a request for funding to try and put coronavirus in bats, in an attempt to create a super vaccine. They got declined for funding obv and then miraculously covid spread bc someone ‚Äúate a bat‚Äù like a year or so later lol
109327	Why is @GregAbbott_TX getting the vaccine before front line workers and the elderly? He needs to wait like the rest of us. He‚Äôs been openly killing us since #COVID started. If we‚Äôre still alive in 2022 we need to vote him out. #AbbottFailedTexas #TexasDeservesBetter #TexasCovid
109594	@WordOfNadja @benhabib6 Interesting! I knew Sweden led many countries in health care. Individualism is quite prevalent in America, but has its pluses and minuses, particularly when individuals are wrong but believe they are right, such as those refusing to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. Questioning is a 1/
111006	Looking to interview someone with mental illness who has struggled with isolation in the past year, or for whom the Covid-19 vaccine is a beacon of hope, about their experience.This is for an article on mental illness &amp; vaccine eligibility. I can keep you anonymous. DM me!
202328	Happy day ‚ù£Ô∏è Got my 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine üòä I'm so thankful I was able to receive in a relatively very short period of time üíï Hope this pandemic will ends soon üôèüò∑#vaccinated @WHO https://t.co/e5BbYgAyND
112379	@globalnews If vaccines actually prevent infection and retransmission, then it is one thing.  But if they do not, then what is the passport indicating?  The bearer will not get too sick, or die of Covid19?  Covid19 is not the biggest killer in this world.  Other sicknesses can be serious too
202019	I was fortunate to receive the first dose of the #COVID19 Moderna vaccine yesterday. My heart is full + I am so grateful for science. ‚ô•Ô∏èü¶† https://t.co/xygC6BnGsF
202374	Doubled jabbed as of yesterday. Like last time, only side effects are sore arm &amp; feeling tired (went to bed at 20.30 last night!). Feel much better this morning, although who wouldn't feel good after 10 hours sleep üòÜ #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
108858	@edusanchez19us @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @senatemajldr So stupid. The Chinese Weaponized Coronavirus Spreads. People get infected. That's going to keep happening until we reach herd immunity throughout the USA or there is rapid treatments &amp; working vaccines. There is no stopping the Chinese bioweapon. You can only delay infections.
112505	@SHEsus__Christ They actually working on a HIV vaccine right now it will work like crap you take the vaccine every six months and it will be based on the same type of technology that got us the covid-19 vaccine
110557	THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE that you will not be participating in my life if you do not get a vaccine. #CommonSenseNotNonsense
112235	So question If someone has contracted covid19 previously is there a need to wait any specific time period before taking the vaccine?
112691	I sometimes wonder if the leavers types are scared of the coronavirus vaccine because they think it‚Äôll make them become a rejoiner :)
108626	Don‚Äôt believe him? Well then he will show all of you he‚Äôs fine on national television. Just like he did with showing that the vaccines and treatments work for coronavirus
108729	I'm not anti-vaccine, but can I have some faith in my immune system until I see if my friends grow any extra limbs in the next year or two? #Covid19
112487	It‚Äôs possible already to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccine on CVS app but literary on MA there is no way to get any appointment. total dissapointment
111411	There were several mutations before Delta emerged and it won't be long until it mutates to a strain the vaccine doesn't protect against.
109702	Simply, getting #COVID19 vaccines is like to train dogs (your immune response) to defense thieves (virus) in the yard. They are NOT well-trained, may bite the virus, or may bite you or may drool over the virus
109993	I can‚Äôt wait, in ten years my late night tv will have ‚Äúdo you or someone you know take the Covid-19 vaccine?  You may be entitled to compensation.‚Äù Commercials everywhere
107861	@AndrewHolnessJM Question: is it true that the vaccine doesn't prevent the coronavirus? (If that's the case, what would be the purpose of taking it then.)
110217	*Is this what the testing is about, do they want to identify those who haven't received a flu vaccine? *Dr. Rashid Buttar says everyone who has had a flu vaccine the last 10 years would likely test positive for the Coronavirus, which they will use to further the police state!
110095	Twitter is telling me : don't look. I don't know if it is legit, but I need to give it a shot myself to judge if yes or no. And keep using my brain, common sense and researches instead of letting the medias tell me how I should think and what I should believe. #COVID19 #vaccine
109596	@TribeJefferson @citizenwillis @gtconway3d Oh no, these aren't 'rallies'!They're official Whitehouse press briefings.Or maybe an official Coronavirus task force briefing.Or maybe an Operation Warp Speed vaccine briefing.Or wait, maybe I'll sign some executive orders kind of meeting.They'll figure it out as he goes.
109471	@TsarNichII Agreed govt always kills more people. But in the history of vaccines and illness, there's never been a human vaccine for a coronavirus, but now is the time? You're right it's non-zero, but extremely close to zero.
111233	@CindyKendrick11 Vaccines against the related coronaviruses that cause SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have worked in animal models only. There has not yet ever been a successful coronavirus vaccine.
112030	@Danada54 @ProudSocialist @SymbioticWrld That is indeed a very concerning point, but it's not an easy one to digest for the mass-public.  Completely changing the economic system is much needed, and humanity is running out of time.   60% of all staff workers don't even want to take the Covid-19 vaccine here in CA, so...
109309	This is despicable. at this point I am starting to believe they‚Äôre using the pandemic as a form of population control/eugenics the way they keep promoting the COVID hoax to their constituents but are first in line for the vaccine&amp; making sure they have health insurance.
202303	Jacqueline Alpeter posted in June a photo of herself with these words around it: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not having the vaccine. My body, My choice.‚Äù In May she posted a photo of herself and the words ‚ÄúI trust my immune system not an experimental vaccine. My DNA, My Choice.‚Äù https://t.co/xLIkF7JxJe
110685	@Cryptof69260077 @genesimmons I found out last week that we‚Äôve been working on this vaccine since SARS and swine flu, they‚Äôre coronavirus too. It‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve been working on it so it‚Äôs not as rushed as we think.
109168	Don‚Äôt agree with this to be honest. Genuinely don‚Äôt care how much it costs or who profits from it, just get the vaccine created, scaled up, distributed and prescribed ASAP so we can all see our family &amp; friends again and stop thousands more deaths.
112098	@CBCAlerts If herd immunity doesn't work, then a vaccine won't work, and we might as well open up now. Immunity to coronavirus being shortlived would basically be the end of any hope of controlling it.
108460	This really would explain everything... and would mean we need to adjust the research needed to make a vaccine... ASAP.
111539	#COVID19 testing and vaccine information + health promotion has to be culturally-sensitive and community specific.I keep seeing vaccine comms. suggesting ‚Äúget the first vaccine you are offered‚Äù. HOW does this address the hesitancies or mistrust amongst people? #ONpoli
202393	@tomselliott @ezralevant So if I got my initial shot two days ago, the booster will be due on the 8 month anniversary of desperate Afghans falling out of the sky from American military aircraft.  #Afghanistan #COVID19 #Talibans
109170	@DrEricDing I doubt I will forget my 2nd COVID-19 vaccine dose if I can get the first one. Maybe I'll download the app later as a goodluck talisman.
201868	Got my letter through I'm getting vaccinated in Methill??? Do I need a jab to go to Methill before getting the jab in Methill?? #coronavirus
111305	@pfizer @PfizerCA can you please comment on this. This is very concerning if our Provincial Health officer is planning to not follow the proper dosing schedule here in BC for your vaccine.@CPHO_Canada may need to step in on this.#bcpoli #covid19bc #COVID19Canada
109065	People not understanding that 90 ‚â† 100 and trying to use one offs as proof the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work are annoying af. I‚Äôll take my chances with the 90% and y‚Äôall can play around with the 0% effectiveness of having NO vaccine all you want
108752	In all likelihood @realDonaldTrump will do exactly the same with a vaccine if developed in USA. Only hope is that developer is outside US. But @nadhimzahawi is the kind of politician that will allow poisonous slimy chlorinated chicken in to Britain because it offers - death!!
108733	As expected, very welcome news. People with compromised immune systems may not mount an adequate immune response to vaccination. @CBSEveningNews @CBSThisMorning @FaceTheNation @CBSSunday @60Minutes #Covid_19 #immunocompromised #vaccine
111089	Christ. This is if people actually follow the guidelines.On the plus side; new job in Feb, guy I'm replacing has done very little due to Covid, thought we'd have a ton to do then as Vaccine will be start improving things. Looks like an easy couple of months for me...
107711	You're not having the Covid-19 vaccine? Good, more for me then.I've been inoculated against the 'rona 25 times and there's nothing you can do to stop me.
107803	Who cares if people get sick with coronavirus? You'll likely recover &amp; have antibodies in your system. But no...Big Pharma doesn't want you to develop immunity naturally. They want you to pay for a vaccine...so that you develop immunity (when you could have for free).
111087	@CDCgov hi, I am wondering, with the vaccine coming soon, will people need to be tested for covid-19 before being vaccinated? Do we know what can happen if one is asymptomatic and get the vaccine?I think the possibility of this to happen is very high.
111102	@bencorke @Keith99352796 @UxbEconomist07 They never claimed it did. You made that up. It reduced the effects and hospitalizations of covid. Then idiots like you refused and made it worse. You do know with been research coronavirus vaccines since the 80s? This wasn't the 1st covid. It was coronavirus ID-19.
109541	Gates is an admitted eugenicist and wants to force you and your families to have a coronavirus vaccine. üëá
111730	@stuartflatt There has never been a successful coronavirus vaccine. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever get one.
202047	Big Bird rules. My wife and I got our boosters a week ago today and my ten-year-old niece is getting her first one tomorrow and we couldn't be prouder.
202041	I can feel my Pfizer #COVID19 vaccine working. The increasing loss of autonomy as the government takes greater and greater control of my thoughts and movements through the implanted chip.  1/2
108014	NO cuz there‚Äôll be NO vaccine for this coronavirus becuz it mutates &amp; there over 10 strains. Canadians have been infected by different strains cuz it is mutating. Hence NO virus will be found like our regular flues - too many strains!! One shot - no guarantee its the right strain

201880	@DrennanEdward I‚Äôm not sure but I know my life insurance covers anything COVID-19 related, including vaccines. I‚Äôm not going near the job though! I just got off the phone with them A short while ago and I will be having Hardcopy confirmation emailed to me.

112231	How long will it take for the 16% to reach 100%? Is the recent boost in vaccinations enough? Although we still don‚Äôt have enough vaccine supplies to begin with‚Ä¶
110596	@MuffinTimeYay @ChrisMcK2018 @SkyNews @AlokSharma_RDG The common cold is a coronavirus and no vaccine has ever been found ... in fact no vaccine has been found for a Coronovirus strain
112425	If you have the vaccine you can still get the virus and spread it. No vaccine has been shown to fully stop the spread.
107890	Preparation would seem like a good idea to roll out vaccines for younger kids ASAP once approved. @SaskHealth @SKGov @MerrimanPaul @Carla4Lakeview @ not on Twitter Dustin Duncan
109041	"@KING5Seattle Of course they do. That's what this is all about. Follow the money. Not complicated to understand. Hell, the NIH signed a contract with Moderna in Dec. 2019 before the ""plandemic"" to secure rights to any coronavirus vaccine that they may develop. Look it up."
110001	There seem to some serious issues with the vaccine roll-out. The first people getting the vaccine are not emergency responders but ANYONE in gov't. This is happening locally for me as well. Not enough talk about this.
109086	@RottenInDenmark came out in the news that Getting Covid19 can cause ED that does not go away after you recover from Covid19 so get that news out there it seems like it would be really good incentive especially for those who mistakenly think that getting the vaccine would emasculate them.
112643	IMPORTANT- Been waiting time see something like this. It‚Äôs a schematic outlining how the #COVID19 #vaccine might be distributed when there is not enough (or who is considered first priority etc) üëá
112008	If every country can use crash test dummies to save lives, then why don‚Äôt the creators of the three different Covid-19 vaccine share it too? It doesn‚Äôt make sense that we don‚Äôt have enough vaccines for the entire world. Work together, make a difference, and open the world. ‚ù§Ô∏è
108872	Trump's promising everyone will start getting two doses of a coronavirus vaccine for free in Jan.If he loses the election, do you think he's going to keep his promise?

202387	@AshleyGunstock Just to say today was my first volunteer shift with the covid-19 vaccine program at a 100% independent pharmacy (which is also a post office and normally a news agent) and that they are doing a fantastic job and saving lives far and wide.
108638	Question: If an unvaxxed person contracts covid-19 then beats it and fully recovers. Why would they need to be vaccinated? They have already had it, wouldn't it mean they are immune to it now? Just curious &amp; im fully vaxxed btw.
109426	@reviewjournal Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.

202397	Just had my first Covid-19 vaccination jab at a busy Barmulloch Community Centre in North Glasgow. @NHSScotland doing a great job!
112515	If contracting, falling ill, surviving, and recovering apparently don‚Äôt give you immunity to the virus, then why is there a vaccine even being talked about... also, can anyone who wants that ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù just take a bullet to the dome instead and quit wasting everyone‚Äôs time
111983	Quite amusing to see #antivaxers having the #COVID19 #CovidVaccine and the excuses they give for why they‚Äôve had it! üòÇüëçüíâ
112822	Will the US Covid vaccine be free of charge, too?   If we are really serious about mitigating this virus, I would hope so.
109315	@FergalBowers @rte Hey Sherlock As you claim to be an journalist why aren‚Äôt all the poor countries that have no vaccine or only 5% vaccinated not dying in the millions ?Are they immune to #COVID19 Or is it just an western disease ü¶†
110679	@Bald_Eagle_2 @Unity_Coach And we dont even know long term effects. Theoretically if it gave people Alzheimer's or is ischemic lesions or autoimmune or cancers we might know in 2 years. Coronavirus vaccine animal trial history is fascinating
110589	Well, Holy Pf*ck. The state of NM has decided that I *am* vaccine worthy ‚Ä¶ Pfizer, in my case. Must be a computer error cause the code works and all, but looks like I get shot tomorrow. #COVID19
111653	My question, to folks, that encouraging others, to take vaccines, for COVID-19. Say, the person listen, to you and get vaccinated, and after get COVID-19 and die or the person die from vaccine, without having COVID-19.  What would you say, to their love ones? Opinion
110837	I love this @ChrisCuomo. It's absolutely no sense. Everyone should ask him/herself why we don't see cases of Polio, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Tetanus, Varicella. It's because we have vaccines. Please, get ready to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Together we gonna win. Vaccines work.
112103	@SkyNews The proclivity for rapid mutation by RNA viruses has been known for decades. When the 1st #COVID19  mutations appeared targeted to the Spike protein why were vaccine developments not reoriented to contain additional virus antigens? This is not hindsight it's learning from history
108439	I have zero sympathy for any adults in the US getting Covid-19 and who passed on getting the vaccine. They should have to pay out-of-pocket for their own medical care. If people want to be stupid, let it be on their own dime.
110179	@RealBasedMAGA @LVNancy 1. Flu has a vaccine that doesn't eradicate the virus, returns annually.2. Cancer doesn't have a vaccine. Years of study and $90+ billion spent.3. COVID-19 has a vaccine in testing, COVID-19 has only been around for a few months.It's like COVID-19 is a miracle.
109280	WAHH MODIJI WAHHWhat a partiality is going on in this country!!!!!! CBSE students are students and they are the future of this country and they can suffer from Covid-19, but the SSC students are Not students they are vaccine of Covid-19 there is no worries for there families.
202222	I‚Äôve just had my COVID-19 vaccine. Anyone who refuses need to look in the mirror and think of their families at their funeral..So far no sign of Bill Gates, I‚Äôve not turned Gay, I‚Äôve no desire to kill and am not at imminent risk of death. Do yourself a favour. Get the jab
108954	Thankfully, I was able to get my booster, get my flu shot, and I am wearing my mask. Only plan to see a small handful of people who believe in these things too. ‚ù§Ô∏è
108829	@NikolovScience @KassandraKitson One must ask,  why would Fauci fund millions to a chinese lab for gain of function testing on CoronaVirus......while also funding vaccine research for those same Coronaviruses.  Especially when he's the lead guy in the US for a pandemic response.    Odd no???
112401	Wokeninams don't care about the price. Even if they are cheaper (heck even if Sinovac will just give them for free), as long as they're from China, their sinophobia won't stop tingling until they persuade the public that the Chinese vaccine is some kind of biochemical weapon. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
109837	So, I got a message from my doctors the other day about making an appointment to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Unfortunately, I've done my homework &amp; I want the J&amp;J shot. The 1 shot my doctors DON'T have access 2. Shouldn't ppl b able 2 choose which shot they get w/o having 2 travel?

108505	@SpankHorton What do you mean by ‚Äúduring the vaccination process?‚Äù You can‚Äôt predict whether a variant will happen or not and if it does happen, if it will breakthrough a vaccine. We‚Äôre in Omicron. That‚Äôs the 15th variant. Publicly available information.
112915	@hungryjesse @afneil This whole right wing obsession with Sweden's Covid-19 stategy is clickbait. This unscientific belief that herd immunity is a viable option, when it's just natural selection. No viral herd immunity has ever been achieved without the use of an effective vaccine.
112358	@JustinPulitzer I‚Äôm not saying to keep the economy shut down till a vaccine is approved. But no one has made a plan to social distance while opening the economy. If you open it up and say it‚Äôs open, people are going to think it‚Äôs over. Go back to what they were doing before they heard of COVID19
110974	This is great news even if it‚Äôs still too far off - kids need vaccines yesterday. School has started in most places.
107692	"@JohnCornyn I don't get why ppl think having 380k ppl test positive for a novel coronavirus is ""okay.""Hypothetically - if no one died but it still spread like this and ppl began having the actual disease and we're sick for days or weeks at a time with no vaccine or know who's infected"
202091	this shall serve as my official request for my newsroom/all newsrooms to henceforth refer to the vaccine, exclusively, as ‚ÄúFauci Ouchie‚Äù....hearing no objections, the resolution is adopted *bangs gavel*
109234	I miss Wi Spa so much and it‚Äôs the first place I‚Äôm going after immunity from the vaccine has kicked in. If the place survives. Ugh.
202097	This time last year I had COVID-19 and today I had my first vaccine, what an action packed trip around the sun this has been
110934	Here comes the propaganda...did you think they'd release a vaccine and the world would go back to normal?  Nope, the DNC Mouthpiece is here to let you all know, you will be controlled like sheep...take the vaccine and use a mask, two ineffective measures
109659	If hydroxy chloroquine is effective against #COVID19 Would the funding dry up? Would the Gates Foundation &amp; their ties to #Fauci be severed? Why doesn't media ask #Fauci if he and his friends have a vested interest in finding an expensive vaccine vs a generic treatment? #OAN
109806	@Jo19291031 @ToniParsons14 @Anna98831 @ProfTerryHughes @GeraldKutney the coronavirus exists because of climate change and human consumption. Viruses are fuses for overpopulation. New viruses form when normally separate species are forced to share resources, like after a wildfire. Next pandemic is coming from south america. Vaccines or prevention?
111892	Our immune systems protect us here thanks. I‚Äôll let someone have my jab who really needs it. #coronavirus #VACCINE
109966	@WSJ @WSJopinion @gerardtbaker How do you think the globalists got a huge supply of miracle vaccines in short order. They money laundered through Afghanistan. Then they created a coronavirus pandemic. Our benefactors are psychopaths.
111824	@MusubiBrand @theflowernurse @LarouxVandyk Now if someone would develop an actual vaccine for a coronavirus, we‚Äôd be in business. But after decades of trying , no one yet has been able to do it.
108511	Thisüëáüèª is the pivotal moment the US loses its hegemony. For the world to see, global organizations and other countries are presenting a pandemic response that the US has bungled. Also, the power of price setting: how can a vaccine now costs $30, $300,... in the US?
109756	@jamesmatesitv The #Covid19 problem in Europe has NOTHING to do with #CovidVaccines as they make no difference and may do harm.How people hang on to convenient myths!The solution is herd immunity. Which, like Sweden, is now happening in the UK.I know what I'm talking about.
107914	Israel: Pfizer's mRNA vaccine is only 64% effective in preventing coronavirus infection after two doses, compared to 94% in May. In addition, the researchers warn that it is too early to say how effective the vaccine is to prevent hospitalization.
112093	@sunlorrie you want to know why there is vaccine hesitancy. Because it‚Äôs all a damn lie .. the government obviously has not one clue about science so why would anyone in their right mind go get it. It comes with no relief of the tyranny so obviously it does not work

112028	If the Coronavirus is a virus and the pharmaceutical companies can come up with a vaccine for it, can they come up with a vaccine to the AIDs virus and give it to kids before they start elementary school and give it to all of the adults in the U.S. too??!!

109755	I don‚Äôt want the coronavirus vaccine because the government is putting microchips in them to track me, a clearly important person somehow, getting high off my ass and shoving fistfuls of potato chips into my gullet while watching the Simpsons üòî
108767	@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo Please can you do something about our criminal government here in UK. The way in which they're treating us like guinea pigs with an experimental vaccine is like things you read about during WWII. They will seriously end up harming the population.üôèüèª
110524	A worthy read about the problems with our current testing system and how that will play out as the vaccine is rolled out.
110268	6 out of 7000000 had clots. How are they sure na yung vaccine ang cause? Same with AZ. ????? I dont get it, why would they delay the rollout for this very very very very rare instances (that may or may not even be related to the vaccine).
111917	@dirtydiscooo I just had Covid-19 a few weeks ago and I'm not getting the vaccine. I'm also diabetic. Still not afraid. I survived it and I will continue to live life without fear. Never give up, never surrender.
108611	Well darn! Just when we thought it was safe, hahaha, lol, Get the jab they say and everything will go back to normal, yea right! No to the VAX has been preached for awhile and NOW you know WHY!
110932	@thehill Why are employers sacking the un-vaxxed - and businesses ban them - the vaxxed can still get Covid-19 and still spread it to others - are equally infectious - so there is no protection of staff or customers ??? Can any employer or manager or MP explain this ???
107687	Right cos so many people have ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù? Where has he been the past 4 years? Anyway, nobody better come near me unmasked unless I say otherwise. Im not trying to test the efficacy of my vaccine with my health problems. This so called doctor is going to get people killed
108682	@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump They will take away all your credit on the Vaccines innovation and the fast work you put in for extensive testing. No other country in the World has such an extensive COVID-19 testing.
109031	@CNN @andersoncooper @drsanjaygupta Given how devastating this pandemic is, should we consider an ‚Äúin-vivo vaccine, where we purposely expose healthy people to a coronavirus positive individual for a brief period, in order to give them a mild viral load, in hopes they will mount an immune response and avoid serious
109098	So, if not taken urgent steps to infuse resources, the #COVID19 vaccine may be a rich country commodity. Uneven spread of the vaccine may not be a good idea either. A porous wall is a little or no protection.

112059	getting a covid-19 vaccine should be a law. you don't want it? then go to prison. no, you can't pay. it's unbailable. the only way to get out is to get the shot or rot in jail.

109971	"Fuck this stupid country. A private clinic is offering Covid-19 vaccines to 30+ year olds but it looks like they are just in it to rip off the local counties that actually budget and provide universal healthcare but for political reasons get billed when private clinics ""help""."

110263	@lizoluwi @johnlittle Unlike countries where #COVID19 is rife, we can easily afford to wait until a reliable effective vaccine is available. I just do not understand why people are in such a mad rush to take something sub standardüôÑüôÑ
109133	Oxford #covid19 Vaccine:‚ÄúWhich is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected. What to make of this data? It is crystal clear that the vaccine did not provide sterilizing immunity to the virus challenge, the gold standard for any vaccine. It may provide partial protection.‚Äù

108867	@WAVY_News And it COULD also be just another variant they're collecting to develop next year's iteration of the vaccine. My god! STOP IT.The obiden administration is collecting 25k samples (per wk?) for DNA sequencing in preparation for next year's flu/coronavirus.Don't go hysterical.
108949	Y la vacuna Rusa? Solo Argentina... And  the Russian vaccine? Not even Mexico uses it. Only in Argentina.
112578	By allowing places to charge for aspects of administering the vaccine, you make the guarantee of it being free everywhere less believable. I know most places aren‚Äôt charging, but if people had to pay to get tested, why WOULDN‚ÄôT they think they‚Äôd need to pay to get the vaccine?
110871	This is serious for the US. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are hard to produce; quantities are limited. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine needs a new Phase III trial. Now this one has to restart its trial, too. If the J&amp;J vaccine hits a snag, there‚Äôs not enough.

109143	@WFKARS @PapaMojoJoeJoe Unvaccinated folks with no valid, specific MEDICAL excuse for not getting vaccines need to start paying constant daily penalties until they man-up/woman-up and get their shots. Otherwise, America's Covid-19 pandemic, which should have ended months ago, will drag on for years.
109505	@Q13FOX BUT what is her vaccine record? Any flu shots in the last year? Then she will give a false positive for coronavirus. There‚Äôs coronavirus in the flu shots of the last two years.

111458	Even after a COVID-19 vaccine comes out and it works, the Democratics will not be willing to give up on there power that they gained so easily. They will try to keep there tight grip on everyone.
112229	@benshapiro I had mandatory vaccines to attend school  (I'm 62) my kids had mandatory vaccines to attend school (they're teens now), what is the difference @benshapiro ? BTW, I bet you had the covid19 vaccine,  right?
107780	@ccpolitics123 @jaketapper The herd immunity you recommend is estimated at 60-80% of the population. No one, including NY, is safe yet.    Another factor is that when the virus does not kill, it can cause terrible, perhaps lifelong damage.    Also, the annual flu vaccine works against a coronavirus.
110466	This government's idea of dealing well with #coronavirus is hospitals coping, the economy continuing as though there isn't a pandemic and using cases to find a vaccine. It's not to prevent cases. They don't care if people get sick, have long term problems or die. 1/
108345	Is it me or this administration is using black doctors and nurses as props for encouraging Americans to accept the vaccine? First to get COVID-19 and die, First to test the vaccine. Doc Rivers: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs amazing why we keep loving this country, and this country does not love us back‚Äô
110607	Lmao @ all the men in my DM after I posted about Covid-19 causing erectile dysfunction.Yall want the vaccine now huh?
108522	I don't know why foreign residents from countries that don't  have universal health care system are desperately finding fault in ours.  Japan needs to modify some of it to match this global pandemic explosion, yes, but COVID-19 vaccine is not the holy grail.   1/2
109681	Honestly the coronavirus vaccine is really fucking cool. Instead of using dead pieces of the virus they are using the RNA which our own cells will use as a blueprint to create proteins shaped like SPIKES, hence the name coronavirus. Our cells will know how to make tiny crowns now
110167	Any person that discourages vaccination‚Äîwhether passively or actively‚Äîis just either plain unaware or deliberately malicious. There‚Äôs been ample research and reasoning on getting the COVID-19 vaccine: it stifles the chance of powerful mutations, and allows the return to normalcy
112592	@kieraevebutler Kiera your comment about me being a vaccine skeptic is inaccurate and offensive. I'm not vaccine skeptical.  If you watched my IGTV on the coronavirus vaccine rather than making a facile assumption you'd know this. I expect a correction (and an apology would be nice).
108050	And you wonder why people are concerned about getting vaccinated.. I‚Äôm not an anti, but completely understand why people would hesitate.. there is no long term data, no matter how much you claim ppl are stupid not to blindly get the jab

112447	In China 0,006% caught the virus resulting in 3200 deaths. Can anyone do the math for 60% of population catching the virus?This is crazy, we need containment and lock down; we need vaccine immunity not herd immunity killing millions
111402	There're a lot of reasons this is terrible but just one of them is now they've incentivised unvaccinated people to show up to work even when they're sick and/or to avoid getting tested.üôÑVaccine mandates are good but they cannot be enforced with policies like these.
111121	In all seriousness, can I sue someone that is vaccinated for giving me COVID because they are knowingly going around spreading the virus? Because I can sue someone that gives my HIV who knowingly spreads it‚Ä¶. #FoodForThought #Covid #CovidVaccine #coronavirus

109151	@GovParsonMO I don't believe the vaccine has gone through enough testing and with the way the COVID19 mutates, no vaccine is going to be effective at any given time.  I think we are going to see some major health issues arise from these vaccines.
110457	@PPHEricRussell How long have we been waiting for a vaccine for the common cold? That is also a coronavirus. I wouldn't hold my breath for an effective vaccine. They have already distinguished over 30 different mutations of this one.

108020	But the Vaccine doesn‚Äôt working forever only for temporary to save lives humans.  If you lucky and healthy you will okay. But when you go out still need to wear mask to protect yourself. You don‚Äôt know who else still has a Covid19 spread. I am always wearing mask  when go out.
108808	@dpakman There's a certain level of optimism/pessimism at play. It's been months since lockdown and we still didn't beat it. We've never have a coronavirus vaccine. If you don't think we'll eliminate it, lockdown doesn't make sense beyond keeping hospitals from being overrun.
112646	@nickhalme @MLevitt_NP2013 With respect, you don't know what you're talking about. A pandemic is a widespread infection. Covid-19 has produced a pandemic. It's from the coronavirus family - that doesn't mean a vaccine can't be produced, nor that you can't get population immunity.

110014	@CP24 My question is it‚Äôs been proven by many scientist that this virus mutates itself within 10 hours so how is this vaccine going to cure COVID-19 if it mutates itself that quickly? And how does it take a decade to produce other vaccines but this took under a year?
202377	Got the first covid-19 vaccine today!If you're going to get it from Mbagathi Hospital, like me, use election day timing. I got there at 8.30am and got the vaccine at 1.30pm then shortly after, they'd ran out so be there early! Here are some other venues giving vaccines. https://t.co/fKrbNuSavd
111875	So China has been quiet regarding a #vaccine . You would have expected them to have the first vaccine for #COVID19. Very strange you don‚Äôt even hear about their infections nothing? While the rest of the world grappling with a #newstrain #newstraincovid ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§≠üëÄ
110196	Oh my god, good news! My mother got the first of the two-stage #COVID19 vaccine today!! üòä#CovidVaccine
109687	@halvorz the news are saying shortage of medicines in gral. What are they using to counter coronavirus since there's no vaccine?
112842	@PedzisaiRuhanya Covid-19 virus has a right to life, vaccine will kill the virus, that's not cool. The virus has rights to exist in us.
109325	I'll tell you what, if the vaxer's can get past the shots from my gun, then I'll take their shot of vaccine!
109996	I live in AZ.  If THE TRAITOR @dougducey makes that VACCINE MANDATORY Fla is where I'm moving.  I've NEVER had a FLU vaccine and Not taking the LUCIFERase mRNA Covid Vaccine
109826	Right. Because getting the vaccine is only about the self interest and safety of the individual...not that person's loved ones or their loved ones. This is so gross.
110925	So, how did they not know this? There are dozens of vaccines on the market.. more proof they have no clue as to what they're doing and they don't work
108868	So Sajid Javid is saying ‚Äòas long as a minor is competent they can overrule their parents‚Äô by having the vaccine.In the #BMJ it has already stated that there is no medical benefit to jabbing kids.  The govt to taking our social freedom for granted. #VaccinePassports #COVID19
110520	So fair to say it make no difference if you have vaccine or not you still going to get it and vaccine does do much to stop it
108097	Im afraid to  touch that vaccine  trump rushed it they said next year but now they say nov i hope ppl that get it will be ok
112128	My question would be how much time until this variant becomes extinct (and if it matters for the vaccine) üòÅ #justkidding
112221	What happened to all those politicians being on the news as they were getting their first jab coronavirus vaxx?Have They forgotten to back for the second, third etc? They can‚Äôt possibility claim that they are fully jabbed,can they? #mRNA #COVIDIOT #COVID19 #covidID #BBCBreakfast

110214	I don't get the point. Fully vaccinated people can spread covid.. plus u18s don't need a negative test so they can go in and spread covid anyways!!! Still haven't seen a valid reason why vaccine passports work.
111877	@chicagobeers1 @Causeway06 @SeanCasten Coronavirus‚Äôs have been around forever and they aren‚Äôt going away. Similar to the flu. It‚Äôll be here. The vaccine only work 3-6 months and it‚Äôs looking like they‚Äôre not very effective. We can‚Äôt live in fear forever.
112613	When pressed to clarify, WHO Spokes-neutral gendered non declarative asexual person said, ‚ÄúSure we said the vaccine was necessary to ‚Äúget back to normal‚Äù, but then we realized we can‚Äôt keep you locked down that way so.... sorry, you‚Äôre fooked.‚Äù ü§¨ü§™
112161	@crookeddy @Augusthenriksen @groanlivia @AndrewYang No treatment? Have you been living under a rock? How do you think all these patients with Covid-19 get released to go home?! THEY RECEIVE HEALTHCARE/TREATMENT! There isn‚Äôt a cure or vaccine but there‚Äôs treatment.
109862	So no #COVID19 vaccine for all in India, Hmm! But isn't this advocated all around the world? Big question will be who gets #coronavirus vaccine? Would the ruling parties prefer their voters? Would rich and powerful will benefit and poor and needy be left out? @MoHFW_INDIA
109403	@User_First_Last @florian_krammer @Valueinvestor41 The idea we‚Äôll never get a good enough vaccine to eliminate this coronavirus (or make it endemic) is beyond pessimistic thinking. Getting a good vaccine in 2020-21, from thereout perfect while minimizing transmissions and developing therapeutics
110351	.@JohnCornyn, because of math. If comprehensive eligibility (rather vaccinating everyone) starts in May, give it two months for everyone to get the two doses of the vaccine + 2 weeks waiting period.

111901	@QTWIQ1 This is why we get VACCINATED, so that we don't land in your situation.    I got Covid-19 before new years. Guess what, it only lasted one day.   Vaccine did its job.   Hope you feel better.  But if not then I pray God receives you in his kingdom.
112334	C's kagwe has a point but poorly presented. The vaccine being marketed has the ability to modify our genes which is irreversible. Are we now in agreement to have Gene modified human beings when we have all the time refused Gene modified foods.
112784	So much for ‚Äòfollowing the science.‚ÄôThe science isn‚Äôt clear, that much is obvious and this is why no one should be discriminated against for not taking this vaccine just yet, especially if they‚Äôre young and healthy.
110850	Btw: Results for our #COVID19 clinic this week show PLENTY of positive ppl in the area. The pandemic hasn‚Äôt ended - we can only try to contain it till a vaccine/proven therapy. So if u wanna lose gyms, salons, &amp; stores again? Then keep disregarding the rules meant to protect us.
108692	@MirrorMoney @DailyMirror Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
110390	@FTondalo Agreed... The second wave will be much bigger, and more deadly as it will completely overwhelm medical facilities.There's nothing resembling a treatment or a cure, and vaccines are far off--and may not even work for this variant of beta coronavirus.This may not go away.
111889	@washingtonpost Just now GOD/ALLAH/SHIV has suggested one mentioned below vaccine for this Coronavirus ---------
202193	My cancer institute contacted me and said I was eligible for the covid-19 vaccine and I was nervous and sat there for like an hour listening to @nickcarter @aj_mclean @howied @kevinrichardson @brian_littrell @backstreetboys but I got it. https://t.co/YVWJYlHNSq
112722	@mattjevans @nanogenomic @devisridhar There has never been a *failed* vaccine for a human coronavirus. Look at it that way round. Either not worth the bother (upper resp tract viruses), eradicated before vaccine could be developed (SARS) or still in development (MERS).

109296	@Sheer_Light @jhowellchrist @washingtonpost I'll go ahead and take the COVID-19 vaccine if they go ahead and be liable for any harmful side effects. It is only fair.

111208	@Shirley1314a had flu 3 times. Worked MD volunteer clinic 5 years ago they demanded I take a flu shot = got the flu. Happened again. 2 yrs ago had symptoms of Covid-19 before there was awareness. Left me with no smell. Will not take the vaccines. Not against them but no mandates

So Mr Mark, in earlier tweet my Q ' Is there any racial issue here?It meant that, is it because the #CovishieldVaccine manufactured in #India, it wasn't disclosed, just in case people still have pre-1945 issues, otherwise to me any vaccine is good to keep #coronavirus away!
109167	@ABC I think this is the prelude to much bigger crisis. Reinfection of #coronavirus #COVID19 after taking the vaccine. Once again the a symptomatic may be dangerous after taking the vaccine then virus mutates and spreads this may be called #COVID21 dangerous of all before.
110206	I'm not taking a coronavirus vaccine. No way it's safe. We've been trying to end cancer, the common cold, AIDS, herpes, bells palsy, Alzheimer's, and dementia for centuries, but I'm supposed to believe we have a safe vaccine for Coronavirus in less than a year?

112025	"@nadia_sapphire The Pfizer vaccine teaches your immune system to recognise and attack a certain protein that is part of the COVID causing coronavirus. It doesn't contain the virus. The side effects would simply be your immune system going ""WHOAH, WHY IS THIS NEW PROTEIN HERE, I SHALL KILL IT!"""
109983	RNA vaccines were developed against the lung diseases SARS&amp;MERS,which like COV-19 were caused by coronaviruses.Not only did these vaccines not have long-term efficacy,but they also caused severe autoimmune reactions in the lung tissue,which is why they did not pass clinical trial
112228	@LightHappy4 The Awake quoted an article from Vaccine Magazine from 2003. So in reality, Vaccine Magazine predicted Coronavirus in 2003, not Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses in 2005. Do some proper research.

109414	@BBCWorld @realDonaldTrump if you make it mandatory for all Americans to take this vaccine you will lose my family's vote. These covid-19 numbers are bullshit and you know it. Don't make me vote for the brain dead candidate. Also enough with the dam facemasks. #NoManditoryVaccine
112861	Yes, wearing a mask is meaningless to stop yourself getting covid-19 and with a vaccine, you don‚Äôt need one to prevent spread. But it‚Äôs kind of ridiculous to expect people who have been used to wearing them for like a year now to immediately drop it. Give it like 2 months.
109643	Made the mistake of telling my family that I am scheduling COVID-19 vaccines &amp; my phone has never rang like this... üò≥ I cannot get fired over yo ass. You not 65 or a HCW, fam!
109466	@Thanduxolobell1 @News24 We are a news tracker of the COVID-19 vaccine for all countries, it looks likely Americans will get access to the vaccine. But the big ques. is precisely how effective it ends up being.
109516	@Jmtommas @WhiteHouse The coronavirus vaccine developers have been working on similar virus vaccines for a very long time. Once they had the make up of the virus, they were able to focus on the best way to attack it. Science wins, but they've been at it since the 1st coronavirus hit.

109843	Yup, seniors were told they were vulnerable but according to @fordnation 's so called 'plan' not vulnerable enough to warrant a vaccine in Phase 1.  Like all children, I want my 83 year old father to be able to leave the house without fear.  Ford has really screwed this up.
109858	Gonna leave this here. I theorized months ago that the reason the vaccine was so quick to develop is because it was already in existence. They developed it in conjunction with possible weaponization of Covid according to this article. Still, tons of naysayers in the thread.
110060	Whatever the aftermath may be, once the #CoronavirusPandemic  is over, one thing is sure nobody is going to rebuke a person wearing a hijab in the open.The only people to come against this will be those who have always been islamphobics

112135	@ArmyofShadows2 @photographerXA All vaccines are experimental. It takes years of assessment to fine tune a medical product, like a vaccine. Fortunately, scientists started working on the CV19 vaccine in 2002, during the SARS Coronavirus pandemic.

110026	@anthonysargean2 @DavidHuddo No.  A vaccine, safe or otherwise, may never be developed. No vaccine has ever been developed for a coronavirus in humans. And a new vaccine may need to be introduced every year as with flu.  We need to get on with our lives, accept a degree of risk and protect those most at risk

112920	Yeah, cuz one party is the party of:- vaccines are bad (unless framed as *Trump's* vaccine)- masks don't work- lockdowns are bad- COVID-19 is basically just the flu- Dr. Fauci is evil- going back to the pre-Obamacare days

112087	Would you prefer we were like China?  They are sending out most of their vaccine and hardly allowing any of their citizens to be vaccinated.  They are using the vaccine as a political tool to curry favor with other countries.
108609	May (The Month) will be when I can start getting the Covid-19 vaccine, if stocks are available by then.Might do a blood work to see what other vaccines I lack or need a new boost.Plus it's been 2 years since my last flu. Annual Influenza Vaccinations do work.
109159	"@pcrclaims @Yeadoncampaign ""The coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and drug maker AstraZeneca has shown an average efficacy of 70 percent, depending on dosage"".Only 70% ? Too bad if you're in the  30%  and remember, they are not responsible for any damage to your  health."
108595	You can't make this stuff up (unless it is made up). Pharma company called #Gilead. Legally trying to stop others from getting a vaccine because they want to make all the money.
110737	This drains my confidence !!  Social Distance should be kept until they get a vaccine!!   The Virus wont disappear at the Government say so!!!üò≥
112809	This is Bad.  With a capital B.I'm desperately hoping that the phrasing of the question just left people maybe not answering what we think they are here.  Many may have just been answering whether or not they'd take an untested vaccine rushed out for Trump's political benefit.
109436	@schristakos @BetheMckenzie @friendlyfulcrum @austinfiredept These are very good questions.  The answer is, no almost no one who has a vaccine has died from covid19 or other vaccine related complications. The numbers are minuscule.  And it is a valid question to ask. Taking the vaccine saves lives. You are alive today because of vaccines.
112072	Thank you! (My brother is also in a Phase 3 clinical trial for #CovidVaccine, they did not pick me ‚òπÔ∏è) #Vaccineswork
112716	@AndreaEleanorF1 @BBCNews I'm not saying that this first vaccine isn't effective, but and a big but they've only proven the vaccine has so far low side effects.Why i said 0, is that it looks as if the 44k where not given a covid19 viral load to test against immunity.
110071	@realRicBosiLTC @sabhlok @therealrukshan @reignitedemaust @JoelJammal are you not surprised? This is the push for vaccine. Perth &amp; Tas next.
108357	Got my vaccine at about 9:45am today and so far this whole day my mouth has tasted like copper. But that's all for now! I'll happily take it. ü§™üíâüíâ #CovidVaccine #SecondDose #PfizerVaccine #COVID19
109214	@pnjaban They obviously are on a power trip.  We were told by them the vaccine would protect against the variants, this too, must not be true. A scientist on the Ebola vaccine committee said this COVID19 vaccine wl not protect; &amp; yet it wl compromise ur immune sys 4/variant.
107959	I don‚Äôt get how there‚Äôs suddenly a bunch of ‚Äòsafe‚Äô vaccines when we were told it could take years to develop one.
111007	I'll go the @SuperBowl under these circumstances:1) There is a vaccine2) Someone gives me $2K for a ticket3) The @steelers are in it.
110368	This is excellent! I'm team Moderna too.One of the best simple explanations I've seen so far of why the #COVID19 vaccine was able to get created so fast.  Please share this with those who are not vaccinated to help with convincing them to do it.
112763	@RosieRobertsonx @_seevy @Elliech_ Those vaccines have been around for years NOW, but people swarmed to get the polio vaccine because of how rampant it was. You‚Äôre missing the point with that one. Covid-19 is a virus, and so is the flu. The basis for the flu vaccine has been approved for years, but each‚Äî
109812	They still don't have FDA approval for ANY covid vaccine.  All are still on emergency use authorization.  Flu shots are at least approved.So yes, that does impose on my liberty.  If you want to keep taking these experiments, be my guest.
108509	@DavidLevan15 @lucyallan @BorisJohnson People keep talking about immunity. Current (small) results suggest immunity gone within 6 months. Just like other coronavirus. It will need yearly vaccines that will be only partially effective.
109712	Lol people are living in a fantasy world. Everyone who wants a covid test can't get one, pretty sure government is going to mess this up too. Also, we don't even have a vaccine yet anyways.
112474	The continual Coronavirus Vaccine gloating from the UK is ugly, and not particularly clever. If they stumble, and it is far from over, the rest of the world isn't going to rush to help.Quite the opposite, I would expect...
111659	This vaccine has completely exhausted me, massive headache, no sleep and feel sick. Can only imagine what getting Covid-19 for real would be like
112485	yall mfks who don't follow the rules lmao do u know that covid-19 spread through the air and if everyone doesn't want to give cooperation, vaccine is useless at this point too like what i said they spread through air
107688	Is this my ‚Äúlesson‚Äù? lol it‚Äôs fucked up to require people to get vaccines if they don‚Äôt want it. Sorry not sorry.
108843	Moderna has just asked for an emergencyapproval of their Vaccine for the COVID-19 FAKE virus. How could they have a vaccine for a virus that the CDC says has yet to be identified? Trump or Biden, they both plan to force all ofus to get the vaccine or lose our rights!
110614	Are you going to take the vaccine?#coronavirus #worldhealthorganization  #who #astaysafe #protectyourself #vaccine #pharmaceutical
108512	@sidharth_shukla They do business first... We won‚Äôt get IB things so let that be... I hope in 2021 they make Covid-19 vaccine because I‚Äôm done with  masks and all! Can‚Äôt touch anything just casually man! I wanna be care free once again! Btw til then Take care!

111176	Good virus... keep culling the stupid. Please spare the people who are unable to take the vaccine... wait.. the stupid are killing those people too.No. Sympathy.For.This.
111476	Turns out the Coronavirus is caused by 5G and they are going to microchip the vaccine so they can track us and .... Just saying, it's all a fucking conspiracy, man! It's been revealed to the Christians. The Rapture is near. Don't eat the chemtrails, man!
111064	"You might wonder ""Why is IT/cyber a coronavirus issue?""-IT is how the gov can make sure payments go out on time-Helps prevent fraud-CISA, which is getting $650 mil, has been critical to protecting the infrastructure that is getting vaccines to your community"
110145	@MrMoeOthman The vaccine will be voluntary, because it won‚Äôt really be a vaccine for this coronavirus, but for the next one, the real bio weapon. It will be released to kill anyone who refused the vaccine, because those are the people who don‚Äôt fall in line with everything the govt says
110568	most of the western countries are availing chinas covid vaccine too even they‚Äôre procuring the ones fr developed nations. it‚Äôs a bitter pill to swallow but if you can see it China‚Äôs doing great since mid 2020 while the rest of us are still in the black holeüòî
110978	The No. 4 reason why service personnel are refusing the vaccine:‚ÄúThis is the first time I get to tell the Army NO!‚Äù Good reason. üôÑAnd, yes, this is completely different than the anthrax case.
111787	The UK army an 77th brigade spying on us and using its cyber thugs to bully an make fun of anyone with a different view than the government on vaccines.WHY? They are really trying hard to talk us into taking this vaccine.If it was so safe then why do they need to talk us into it
112046	ONLY MALIAN MILITARY SOLDIERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES GO FOR COVID-19 VACCINES AS TALIBAN SEES THAT AS A TRIVIA MOMENT! WONDERING TO THEMSELVES WHO HAS BETWICHED YOU?BECAUSE TO THE TALIBAN THAT IS A BIZARRE ACTIVITY HAPPENING OUT THERE IF NOT DRUGGING UP OUT THERE
108457	"They're always talking about ""religious objections"" to the #coronavirus #vaccine.  WHAT ""religious objections""?Saying it's ""the mark of the Beast"" doesn't qualify.#antivaxxers are cretins."
112493	I understand the deserved skepticism about the Russian COVID-19 vaccine. What I applaud is; unlike France, Russia has not sought to test this vaccine on Africans first.
108063	"@willripleyCNN Tokyo "" If""  Olympic..............  Beijing Winter Olympic is next actually.  Coronavirus Vaccine in the year 2023 or 2024.  Trial Vaccine next year ( 6 months from now). Just trial vaccine no guarantee."
112852	@QuarantinedCoof @UndercoverFunk #7, actually, and new cases is a TERRIBLE metric, since this disease has no vaccine (and it never will, just like every other Coronavirus), it will eventually get EVERYONE on a long enough timescale. https://t.co/kwUqGfWVim
108828	Then stop calling it a vaccine...Vaccines protect people from the virus...Like polio, measles and mumps...Just call it what it is...An injection of who knows what to counter act god knows...And there will need to be booster shots too...Wake up it's 14months too late for this!
111424	We don't need your vaccine, you've not dealt with the disturbing Microsoft Windows OS, it's human viruses you want to deal with. You're not a medical practitioner, we know your evil plans, it won't work...

112411	@NIHDirector Dr. Collins, Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. You don‚Äôt know the science on this I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including deaths if my idea doesn't work.
107831	"This is why there never was a vaccine for the ""common cold"" also a coronavirus btw.  It kept changing."
107770	@LordHumungous3 I don't need flu vaccine. Maybe you do. My immune system will utterly destroy coronavirus, and most likely already has multiple times.
108959	this is so stupid I can‚Äôt. comparing the use of mRNA vaccines in humans for the first time to the ‚Äúnovel coronavirus‚Äù is so ignorant, and the amount of confidence this man does it with is sad. and the amount of ppl buying it... clearly science education is shit in the US

107875	Debate of the past few days: will you be getting the covid-19 vaccine. Why or why not? ... this has been quite the topic to discuss.
112928	@newsmax Twitter will not take action against Nicki Minaj's tweet linking erectile dysfunction with the COVID-19 vaccine because **they are raging hypocrites who don't want to lose her and her fans.**I fixed your headline for you.You're welcome.
111616	Why do vaccine targets matter when they don't work? Why not allow people to choose how they deal with covid and not force a vax that has limited benefits and potential risks.
108331	@MichaelDeutch @RonnyDirtNap @okkie48 @pet_surft @tedcruz If masks work.. why covid-19 is still growing in countries who mandated it? And why vaccines if masks work?
109913	Why is Dr Fauci saying this about masks! After getting the vaccine, your body will start to make antibodies and you will have a 95% chance for immunity to the China virus! Get on with your life! No more hog wash!
111200	‚ÄúThe coronavirus is now endemic, no longer novel, and has several safe/effective vaccines. While recognizing that every death is a tragedy, if this state of affairs doesn't meet the goalpost for normalcy, what would?‚ÄùMy sentiments exactly!!!
108746	@J2KChoiceCuts @annif007 @gemjandrews @BBCBreaking You could make that argument for many different illnesses, that's life, you can't lock everything down every time there is a potential threat. Covid-19 isn't going to disappear, it will be around forever, but hopefully there will be a vaccine for it in the yrs to come.
111425	@mojos55 Flu mutates too, and we have new vaccines each year. The vaccine from Oxford was designed in a few weeks as had the technology and just needed to tweak it for coronavirus. That vaccine is already in Phase 3, it is being manufactured as I write. Read the science.
108231	So...the 'vaccines' don't work? And Workplace Vx Violence doesn't work? And Medical Segregation doesn't work? Sounds like the NB government has joined the ranks of we anti-vaxxers.
112757	@jdmhav3n @kellylavine @jasonrantz @GovInslee Atleast im not in a Cult thats convinced that the Vaccine against Covid-19 is something that will ruin your very DNA, make god hate you and give you Autism. You already seem to have all those boxes checked in so no Vaccine needed for you I guess.
112767	@briannatravers @FerrierSteph #COVID19  #slowdownmethod I think the vaccine for the epidemic is the last chance. Why is it logically impossible to find a cure for an infectious disease before it spreads? The first is to prevent before coming, the second to control and destroy, and the third is to prevent.
111175	@DaFlumps @kradlum @NHSuk You cannot read? It says, They Don't Know if the vaccine can stop spreading, catching Coronavirus or if it gives immunity. Nothing. There is no evidence. You are free to think what you like and refuse to hear what you are told and what is in front of your eyes.
108723	I'd stab anyone trying to force a vaccine into my arm then I'd never stop killing those responsible. I'd assume I'm dead already and take as many with me as possible. All the animals died in SARS &amp; MERS mRNA studies so deadly FDA denied Human trials.Resistance no matter the price
108059	Brilliant tweet:the Queen and our illustrious monarchy are what makes our country the greatest. You just know all the pc woke lefties typified by @jeremycorbyn hate it. Can you imagine what a boring, Orwellian faceless place this would be if they were in charge #COVID19 #vaccine
109936	@Ashaman3000 @Lizzy_Lang7 @PryceTheHeretic #9 is the reason they should get a vaccine, and hope not to get a Covid-19 infection.
110222	@thedsggroup The vaccine is important long term. Particularly for the most vulnerble.And when covid19 mutates, they need to be able to adapt quickly and possibly annually like the flu.So that's still good research.3/end
112255	@KHONnews Why in the world would someone who already had coronavirus get the vaccine? Newsflash everyone: if surviving coronavirus doesn't give you immunity, we're all fucked, because that would mean we have no idea how anything works.
110900	@SushantBSinha If Corona vaccine will come, then it should give first to them who are seriously ill because in this section, everyone who is poor, rich, old or our corona warriors all will come!#coronavirus #CoronaInIndia
109619	@SDECoxHealth My not be a medical expert but I have a brain. Coronavirus is an RNA virus that mutates more rapidly than other viruses. So even though we magically had these vaccines in the US before the virus or right after it didn't get us ahead of new variants.
112213	So when the vaccine is developed for Covid 19, do the anti-vaxxers get it or do they stick with their beliefs and die? #antivaxx #coronavirus #COVID19
109045	Urgh this tears me down. It's definitely not ethical but if we don't have everyone vaccinated there would be so much transmission risk- if there was a way to combat socioeconomic barriers for equitable access to the vaccine then maybe a mandate is okay? Feeling conflicted #hst440
111981	There's a good chance the Covid-19 vaccine we are all waiting for will be developed abroad. Actions like this almost guarantee the U.S. won't be prioritized if/when it is.
111285	@fordnation @celliottability @normmillerpc why is the vaccine sitting in freezers and not already in arms? #FordfailedOntario #fail #onpoli #cdnpoli #LTC
112143	I have attempted to stay out of the vaccine debate, but I do wish to hear opinions on this.  We as Christians follow The Bible.  How do you feel about Romans 13:1-2 if you are a Christian who is speaking out against it?#coronavirus #vaccines #trustingod

109719	Oh...but I‚Äôm vaccinated and still can‚Äôt enter. Is my vaccine not the same as the one in the US? The @CDCgov honestly need to be more clear here and if it‚Äôs good enough for countries that aren‚Äôt banned then it‚Äôs good enough for those that are. #LoveIsNotTourism
111059	@ashleyroybal Well, I was meant to be going Paris for June 2020 but then Covid-19 so flights changed to Malta for next year, where it‚Äôs bit safer and hopefully vaccine is out by then. Don‚Äôt want to cancel that, really need a holiday.
112246	While the coronavirus mutations are useful for telling lineages apart, they don‚Äôt have any apparent effect on how the virus works.That‚Äôs good news for scientists working on a vaccine.
110610	@or_pip Once governments decided en masse to ‚Äútackle‚Äù coronavirus they were locked in. Moral panic to extent, but nevertheless only one way out of this nightmare - defeat coronavirus. Sceptics are now also locked in to a mirror narrative. That‚Äôs a mistake because they‚Äôll have to have jab
109867	Scientists do not know if the Covid-19 vaccines, being injected into arms around the world, will protect against the NEW Coronavirus StrainsTherefore, you are a fool (noi !!) if you are not taking the 8 steps described in this articlegoogle healthline new coronavirus strains
107970	This thread is just interesting for me. It cannot be the case that the people don't know COVID-19 but they know the vaccine. That is a misconceived opinion. How then are they going to get to know about covid? Until we experience the Brazil situation?
108066	"Just another rationale response on my social media to ""would you like to talk to someone about the COVID-19 vaccine?""""how is no unsure now. No don‚Äôt rape me or I‚Äôm unsure I don‚Äôt want you to rape me."""
111444	@TobyBerry6325 Astra Zeneca is using a chimp adenovirus to create a protective immune response that would attack Covid19 if there is exposure to it. I believe the Russian vaccine is using the same adenovirus for their vaccine.
109263	No sense in rushing it. If it does come before election day, (based on how long it usually takes to go through the various phases of any drug or vaccine for safety, dosage and efficacy) we will KNOW it is bogus. That is why Mitch is trying to get the liability laws changed.
111432	if you drank papa jac out of a vuvuzela at sanse in 2011 then you don't need to worry what's in the coronavirus vaccine
111183	@JamesWo83215114 @CP24 Apparently you didn‚Äôt get the memo, you will not go back to normal you will still have restrictions and you will have to wear a mask. Also the vaccine only helps with symptoms does not prevent coronavirus.
108898	@EssexPR We‚Äôve gone round in a huge unnecessary circle on the science. Why comparisons to influenza viruses came in I don‚Äôt know. That virus mutates way faster than coronavirus. Exposure to viruses gives people their super immunity. The vaccines give people a safety bet on symptoms.
110479	#coronavirus ...  Israeli MIGAL claims breakthrough in #coronavirusvaccine .... If they are correct.... vaccine in 90 days.  #migal
202257	Worth looking at this detailed thread. Just reading this I was very happy that I have had 2 vaccination doses. I'm terrified that so few people in Australia a currently vaccinated. #CovidVaccine
110787	We need to make it like the Icebucket challenge. When someone gets the vaccine, stream it, tag 5 people&amp; spread awareness. Start with the former presidents and make it a wave to show it is safe. I ‚ù§Ô∏è this @BarackObama OR maybe our military members can head this up @travisakers
110617	I believe in vaccines (and also respect the fact some do not believe they‚Äôre in the best interest of their family), but am surprised they found enough families willing to test this out. I‚Äôd spoken w/several MDs this summer who said it would be v. difficult to get test subjects.
111751	@ANCALERTS @ABSCBNNews This is like comparing apples to oranges. No vaccine for coronavirus. That‚Äôs the problem
110988	If you‚Äôre unvaccinated stop being stubborn, stop believing lies &amp; STOP THE SPREAD. The mRNA vaccine has nothing to do with DNA or chips &amp; everything to do with staying alive when you get Covid. You could not know how bad Covid will be until it‚Äôs too late. Why? Protect your life!
112816	@eoinmadden @Interse42081117 If there is a safe vaccine using attenuated virus as 'traditional vax' with is not producing spike in your body - the actual pathogen - then I would take it after proper testing, yes. But no one ever managed that for coronavirus family of viruses before so not likely.
112514	@Dsockz @drdavidsamadi This is just a version of the flu and no one will get permanent immunity to a coronavirus from a vaccination. My immune system is phenomenal. Never had the flu shot and never had the flu in my life. Won't be taking this vaccine either 4 &gt;99% recovery rate.

111120	@WhiteHouse What happens if China or WHO develops a vaccine to coronavirus &amp; they refuse to share it with us because the President was mean? Are you going to send in the National Guard?
108782	I wonder if O‚ÄôToole understands that it is Cons Premiers who are failing in the vaccine effort. If he does  then he is politicking and if he doesn‚Äôt he‚Äôs an idiot
110024	OUR BEST CHANCE OF ENDING THIS PANDEMIC is to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to Covid-19 vaccines. No one is safe until everyone is safe. We need a #Peoplesvaccine NOW. #VaxForAllNow  #LAAdvocacyEM
112858	Could say how the Coronavirus Vaccine is actually just a medical trial, But no one would say it's a experimental thing would they now?
109623	Ah, it‚Äôs so refreshing that we no longer have a curfew in NYC and my neighborhood restaurants/bars and their very drunk patrons have single-handedly produced a covid-19 vaccine so everyone can fully party on the sidewalks like we‚Äôve got a whole block party today. #blessed
111925	I couldn't imagine having a child in this time of the CoronaVirus but I do have grandchildren and my Son and Daughter-in-law are NOT sending the kids back into a classroom without a vaccine or cure! It's not just the kids but teachers and anyone they all come in contact with too.
110182	I keep saying, I'll be glad when I get the microchip in my vaccine so I don't have to keep using the govt COVID-19 app to swipe into shops and cafes.
108092	Completely taken out of context. Fauci said in April 2020, ‚ÄúIf ‚Äòback to normal‚Äô means acting like there never was a coronavirus problem, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population with a vaccine.‚Äù
111727	@redthepianogirl Don't worry. We will get back to the good old days. COVID-19 Vaccines are coming later this year.
108675	The world is racing to find a vaccine for #Covid19 -- but there's no vaccine for #ClimateChange. Tell the @ecb to stop financing big polluters and give us the #GreenRecovery our world needs. #Peoplenotpolluters

108371	If satan is real satan is the mf convincing stoopid people to not get the vaccine with baseless conspiracies
109300	Maybe because cancer is more complex than the coronavirus... and there was an actual push to get the covid vaccine out so we can hopefully return to normal.
112721	"Like I said the outrage about ""vaccine passports"" here is going to be so stupid.We really have got to stop coddling morons in this country."
110367	@MattHancock I ‚ù§Ô∏è Christmas but far too much focus on this during pandemic with no vaccine yet! People must surely realise by now celebrations have to be scaled back to protect everyone.  Feel so sorry for retailers, hospitality, suppliers, hairdressers etcü§∂üèª
110215	@mtgreenee America doesn't want to go back into lockdown is different than what we need to do. People like you who refuse to wear masks and refuse to take the vaccine is exactly why we have all these new mutations of COVID-19 going around. You're what is wrong with America, you're cancer.
111019	Ya and this criminal has money in the vaccine he wants to make every one have so he gets even more rich just like Kill Gates!
112467	I agree, @SenKamalaHarris. This will only get worse if we don‚Äôt take it more seriously. We need to ramp up testing. I‚Äôve also introduced legislation to make the #COVID19 vaccine free once it‚Äôs available.
110985	@jimcramer The Covid-19 vaccines are not being tested against a saline placebo. All other drugs are; why is this an exception? To quote you, this is sub optimal! You need to do some research.
112826	You know my anxiety during quarantine has spiked pretty hard but then I remember theres people out there who genuinely believe the earth is flat, vaccines cause illnesses and the Coronavirus is made from the government in the shape of 5G cell towers &amp; just like that I feel better
109741	I just found out that my mom is going to get her COVID-19 vaccine next week and I am so so so so happy. üò≠ I have been beyond worried about her going in to work as nurse over these past months!
109334	1) This virus has animal reservoirs meaning it can jump back and forth between humans and other hosts. So forget about we will eradicate this virus or COVIDzero2) Although our vaccines are very effective against severe #COVID19  they don't confer sterilizing immunity meaning...
110678	I don't need a #coronavirus vaccine.My kids don't need it either.No microchip for me &amp; my family. The @WHO misled the world.-no human - human infection = ‚ùé-no animal infection = ‚ùé-not transmitted in air =‚ùé-virus can't survive long on surfaces outside human body =‚ùé
112416	The whole story just stinks of politics. If the EU was so keen on having a proved, working vaccine, why don‚Äôt they get some from the Russians, too, and test, compare all the candidates?I‚Äôd say, follow the money, again.
111942	There‚Äôs no vaccine, and next to zero chance they‚Äôve achieved herd immunity, so what‚Äôs the most likely outcome here?
111429	Only way I can explain to 5yo my work is I make coronavirus vaccines (I don‚Äôt).Concept was surprisingly intuitive (he said it sounds like a trick to body) &amp; likened antibodies to a hospital. Let me take this oppty to üôè my @BARDA colleagues who toil 24/7 to advance Vx trials.

109537	Walgreens in Big Chimney currently has extra Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.  First come, first served. Get there now. I was told the shots have to be thrown out when they close this evening.
109254	@JKAMCHACHA @Phidze72 @mwwwn201 @SibandaSibbs @njabulodhlamin3 It‚Äôs worrying. That we have all these soldiers armed to the hilt among civilians in peacetime is worrying. Covid19 is a ruse, a pretext for a sinister motive. In a normal country there would be an inquest, but in Zimbabwe, it‚Äôs done, that‚Äôs it.

111165	@NixonandIke @ki676love @The_Burwel1 @WSJ Do you not understand how vaccines work?!?! A vaccine for COVID-19 Strain A will not necessarily work for COVID-19 Strain B.1.1.7. An example of this is the common Flu Vaccine. You don't get the same Flu vaccine each and every year...it varies with the types of flu strains.
202166	LOLOLOLOLOL so I got this message from my job. I also have all three Covid-19 shots. The purpose of the vaccine is to reduce the symptoms of Covid-19, right? Why am I being told if I don‚Äôt show symptoms, I‚Äôm still expected to work and show up for my shifts until I show symptoms!?
110464	"The truth on Corona virus vaccines  ""There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.""Why then is so much written about COVID vaccines?If a working vaccine is an unlikely event, then is it about the vaccine or something else?"
112331	@TwitterLive Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines.

108850	If there is a vaccine soon, there is absolutely no way the Trump deserves ANY credit for it.The world is working together on this and he has fought science the entire time.And anyway, wouldn‚Äôt you rather see it distributed by a Biden administration?#COVID19

109651	So when are all these clever pharmaceutical companies going to produce a vaccine to the coronavirus. And before any clever clogs says not possible or wrong, the science has to come up with a solution
108646	@DrOlufunmilayo My only question is , as it keeps mutilating does the present vaccine work also against the ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù version of Covid19 or they have to find a different vaccine ?

112876	This is awful! If people who are eligible would just do there part and get vaccinated, things like this wouldn‚Äôt happen. We need to get people vaccinated, continuous testing isn‚Äôt going to end this like O‚ÄôToole thinks. We need mandatory vaccines!
111392	The African Continent has been catered to in regard by China. It is.... Only... China that has supplied WHO approved Vaccines to the African Continent. Racism has shown itself in the African Continent. Humanity has farted on the face of Human Beings. Ugh (La Ugh)
202299	Yikes. Both soon-to-be-available vaccines for Covid19 come with side effects: Covid19-like symptoms that may last a day or so. BUT, to be effective, one must return and receive a 2nd dose. Lots of questions just ran through my mind üò≥. @CLupus63https://t.co/0Ec6l8RbRd
112296	It's disappointing but I think making vaccines is probably kinda tricky, eh? I think we are better off being grateful for the miracles that we are getting and not act all super fucking entitled because there is a delay#covid19 #covid19ab
111046	@NigelKellow @BethLynch2020 No at present there are 7 strains of COVID19,Is this vaccine a blanket for all 7 or just the common 2? I find no info about this.Is the vaccine one that provides lasting immunity or will this be the new flu shot, again no data, understandable since this is new but naw 3rd Round
109416	I know this is a very stupid question but please clear this out for me. Can someone who turned 18 this year get a COVID-19 vaccine? because this person is literally making fun of me saying ‚Äò18+ can get and I‚Äôm just 18‚Äô. I‚Äôm NOT DUMB but it‚Äôs confusing ü•∫üòÇ

112434	Traitor trump...why is there a need for a vaccine for coronavirus when you told us ‚Äú it will just go away‚Äù?
108450	The propaganda connected to their COVID-19 VACCINE became clear when they've said; 'people that have had #COVID19 already, can get it again.' But if you already have the COVID gene (antigen) in you, and they say you can get it again; then what good will their vaccine do. Its B$!
111005	@BHRCSD The Coronavirus vaccine. The big pharma companies dont like Trump and waited till after the election to praise the vaccine. Biden will take credit for Trump's vaccine. Go figure!
109174	@Debs_Kropotkin @DoubleA0317 @ADS21817949 @DrTomFrieden Vaccines prevent long Covid. No they might not stop it completely. But for me it‚Äôs enough that I am not worried about it.
111193	The vaccine is around the corner, but we still need to be diligent in saving lives. Covid-19 has affected multiple people in my life, but recently it almost took a man that has been a father figure to me. Its also now touched on my immediate family and I have to be tested.

112428	Well, the shortfalls are something we already know. It looks like I may not get my booster in May as stated on my Covid Vaccination Card after all.
109742	So now you can‚Äôt even get herd immunity when everyone is immunized, bc then ppl wouldn‚Äôt need the constant boosters that will continue to rake in gvmt $$$ for Big Pharma.

109160	@AlexBerenson There has never been a coronavirus vaccine or rhinovirus vaccine and half the world doesn‚Äôt take the flu vaccine. But this ‚Äúnovel‚Äù vaccine is going to be a game changer.

109443	@jahearthat @irishexaminer @griffinniamh This is why you should check with your doctor before getting a vaccine. Mine usually advises me against the flu vaccine due to the quirks of my immune system. I've yet to have that conversation with him about the covid-19 vaccine.

109371	Don't be appalled. It's only logical since the first vaccines were made without the Delta variant in mind, for example. Flu shots get renewed each year as well. It's just how it is.
108816	Who thinks going on a cruise with unvaccinated people is smart? They have enough trouble passing around sickness as it is. This is crazy. Get your vaccine people!
108318	.Oh dear what can the matter be....i think ive got sepsis.... in my anatomy.....i wish i studied..... endocrinology..... and politely declined my flu jab.

108319	@hrshta_k Makes sense, why would they apply when the vaccines are not destined to be used there. But I don‚Äôt see this will ever happen. They should just allow based on the confidence they have on the vaccine and how it works on COVID-19

111628	It is official the country is screwed. When your vaccines Minister doesn't even know the order in which the months of the year run then you really do start to understand how this Government have made such a complete hash of their response to Covid19.

112250	Another NACI leak. I realize the advisory council has had communications issues, but I don‚Äôt get why this stuff is leaking, and how a leak is helpful for shoring up public trust around a vaccine that is already facing hesitancy.Also: NACI just cancelled today‚Äôs press conference

111394	So why should kids get the vaccine if this virus gives them no symptoms?? Most didn‚Äôt even get a fever!!
108119	These claims are because there seems to be 2 Pfizer vaccines.This is partly true. The vaccine will be delivered in 2 different packagings, 1 that is branded, ‚ÄúComirnaty,‚Äù and 1 called Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The actual vaccine in either package is EXACTLY the same.
109075	Soon they'll be shooting and killing anyone not taking their stupid vaccines. They are just preparing us.

109210	@Textingdaddy @julie44627826 @Reuters Hate to break it to you but the common flu could have been wiped out with everyone getting a flu #vaccine, but here we are 80 years later with the flu running a muck every year. #COVID19 is most here to stay. It‚Äôs estimated that 30% of the population won‚Äôt get the vaccine.
111039	@KENS5 All of my immediate family has had the coronavirus. Those with the vaccine all contracted the coronavirus they received the shot for immunity.
109829	@JaggerMickOZ Nowhere in this document is there any mention of responses to ‚Äòno jab no job.  Rather, the sentiment is to augment the frontline workers who are burdened by the rapid rise in Covid-19 cases in VIC.  If this augmentation covers some staff resigning, so be it. Nothing sensational.
110510	@cendanannie I have already received my first vaccination jab against COVID-19 and am waiting for my second.
107978	üëáüèºcheck out this clip from my conversation with @FadiaTVNews regarding our work to get the #CovidVaccine to the #homeless population of Tampa! @usf_tbsm @USFHealthMed @USFHealth #MedTwitter #EndHomelessness
202276	If you got the vaccine over 2 weeks ago the CDC considers you unvaccinated... So Welcome back to the gang
202076	I got my first Covid-19 vaccine last week and I was incredibly impressed with the system established at the Dayton Convention Center. They were professional and quickly administered the vaccine. Hats off to all working there. Covid-19 Vaccination #SW5602
109015	It was getting made before the virus back in January  and before that so they knew  what was happening so who is making money on this vaccine
110862	@FredeckyB1 By treating it like a real pandemic, mask protocols, shutdowns, social distancing,  they work broadly for any virus, just because there isn't a specific to this virus solution doesn't mean there isn't a solution, also coronavirus vaccines were in development before the pandemic
110307	@OutdoorCrypto @MadDogCoops @JoeyAnselmini @schadnfr @Rover829 @niro60487270 He‚Äôs too stupid to realize they‚Äôre using MERS strains to find a vaccine for the new coronavirus or any other
112689	"News of ""deadly"" British variant overshadowed by the ""terrifying"" SA variant which could make short work of all vaccines? Why does this feel like a #GroundhogDay where they keep looking for an ""African"" variant = Deadliest of them all. Isn't this just the British one going home?"
111082	damn what happened to the mink coronavirus? I know they culled minks in a lot of European countries because of the mutation that makes vaccines less effective against it. Is the mink coronavirus strain really gone? It could show up in the US like the UK variant.
108780	@EliseVelaz9 @busdriverlife I was contemplating this, but then I realized that about half of the vaccines we‚Äôve ever had, I have no idea how severe the disease would be. These dieseases barely register In my brain. I‚Äôd like COVID-19 to be that way for the next generation.
109459	Just dropped my folks off to get their vaccine! Couldn‚Äôt be happier! I caught Covid back in September but never passed it on to them even though we all live in the same house! No idea how that happened! #COVID19 #COVIDVaccination
108241	"@EvanAKilgore MILLIONS have already tested ""positive"" for covid19 so WHY would they need a vaccine for a virus they have already had?ü§î"
109415	Still playing the game with a psi virus orchestrated to destroy America and the Republic.. Too bad you did not get off your asses and expose this psi virus. The so called vaccine is a kill shot poison. No so bright lady!
112078	if you‚Äôre a trump supporter or were out there rioting at the us capital do not worry about what‚Äôs in the coronavirus vaccine
107993	@readthinkwalk @CarnoustieC @campbellclaret They had the luxury of low national debt (20% GDP), which they will be more than doubling to pay for their support measures (to 54% GDP by 2023). What happens if, like every other coronavirus-like virus to date, we don‚Äôt get a vaccine ever? 2 week quarantine forever?
111376	@POTUS Hey Lame Brain! US or the World will never get out of Covid19 with an ineffective Vaccine that does not protect against Variants. Your crazy Government overreach against Constitution will go down in history Crazy Authoritarianism will destroy #Democrats
109636	Based on the historical failures of past coronavirus vaccines, a fast-tracked COVID-19 vaccine could become one of the biggest public health disasters in history. And, no one involved is accountable or will face any repercussions. Instead, they will all profit. #Covid_19
110908	So u got the #Covid19 #vaccine - yay! Did u know some ppl won't mount an immune response? How do u know if you did? Get ur #antibodies tested! Simple finger stick  test looks 4 expected response 2 #vaccination. Call 404-702-3009 #covidtesting #COVID19 #covid #covidvacccine
107871	@essenviews No my favorite was its COVID-19 so they've had 18 chances to get a vaccine (paraphrase) ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
111763	Justice. ‚Äî Anyone too stubborn and dense to get a vaccine really has no business being around sick patients. Period.
108113	I almost want to ask these people how did they expect this pandemic to end if not for a vaccine? Did they think coronavirus would get tired of humans &amp; just leave on its own. The fuck.
201944	Quite a number of my friends in the #NHS contacted me today to confirm they have received their first Pfizer vaccine this week. They had to wait 15 mins after the vaccination in case their is a allergic reaction. Well done to the staff at @uhbtrust #Covid19 #CovidVaccine
108288	Today I got my first jab of the Moderna covid19 vaccine. I get the next one in 28 days which will be during an extended Spring Break (school planned in a 2 week quarantine period).
109447	@FoxNews One lab rat says to the other: ‚ÄúSo are you going to take the Covid-19 vaccine?‚ÄùThe other lab rat responds: ‚ÄúAre you kidding me?! They‚Äôve not even finished testing it on humans yet‚Äù
110022	@StopNewNormal The magical vaccine again that ignores the uncomfortable truth.- We've never developed one for a coronavirus- They normally take 10 years to be safe- No 100% effective (Flu is ~30%)- It'll be over before we need it. No-one has a Spanish flu vaccine (it's not needed).
108629	@dicey_armaney @POTUS Why do you think un vaccinated people don't take covid-19 seriously? That's a bit presumptuous.  Perhaps some are afraid the vaccine will actually kill them because they are very immuno-compromised. Food for thought
111625	@Jenkinsonn3 no. i don't think the vaccines are 100% safe either, but covid really is so dangerous, especially when it comes to collapsing healthcare systems, that they're a necessary, or atleast i hope so. i also believe covid19 was an accident.
110062	@DailyMirror Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
109679	Hard pass on this nonsense. My daughter will never take this, especially when her risk is so minimal there's greater danger for her just driving to school.#NoVaccineMandates #NoMasks #BackToNormal
108647	Same on her! What a horrible, selfish act. Discrace to the human race. This behavior needs to be punished!  What about the senior who dies after her vaccine theft because they could not get an apoointment.  What if Ms griffith had instead helped just 1 senior get an appointment?
110965	@superscuba83 @Mrs_Thomas82 Don‚Äôt lose hope. It‚Äôs a cold virus, not flu, so not expected to mutate as freq. Science have never moved this quickly towards creating a successful vaccine for Coronavirus as colds are generally mild, &amp; previous outbreaks of sars covid fizzled out.
109321	Vaccination is a step towards ending the COVID-19 limitations, why are they protesting against vaccination? If they don‚Äôt want to, they don‚Äôt have to take it. There is no vaccine against stupidity!
111360	when it comes to Any vaccination if its not 100% effective it is worthless, Even if they come out with a Coronavirus Vaccine, IF i am not sick from the coronavirus, Nobody is sticking me with Any vaccinations that are not 100% effective! Doing so to #people=We are Not Guinea pigs
112466	@OliviuG @LaloDagach The vaccine originally being developed for SARS (SARS-CoV-1) is now being used as the basis for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
109714	@FactsMathLogic Well after the peak of h1n1 they developed a vaccine. These are two different pandemics. Fact is there was immunities older folks had that others didnt. This one no one has immunity or antibodies it is a novel coronavirus.
202431	My guess was at least 80% of each community sub-group, so I guess I was (unfortunately) pretty close.  #CovidVaccine
109105	There was life before the #coronavirus and life after the #coronavirus until science find a vaccine and a way to get ppl who recovered and still test positive rid of the virus.
111833	@BBCBreakfast It looks like the EU is going ahead with blocking of Covid-19 vaccines? This just shows what hold the EU Commission has on its members as quite a few of them were against these moves. They are only doing this because the UK has left the Union and that we are so far
111323	Another way the Dems are dictating to us. No vaccine, no job, no income to punish us for not obeying their laws üò° Why aren't our Repub reps fighting back??? üò° Are they part of the Deep State manuevering us to their NWO??? üò°üò°üò°
111622	The conspiracy nuts won‚Äôt take vaccine because they think @BillGates is tracking them..... I wonder how they feel about this one....
107797	"@Gurdur Not sure Ioannidis is irrelevant even now. The idea that COVID-19 is ""like the flu"" is still out there and is being used to stoke vaccine hesitancy. Not all his fault, but he unintentionally contributed to it."
111591	*internally screams* This calendar is SO CUTE!!!! Okay, this, along with scheduling my appointment for my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for next Friday, just made my day!
112414	@VincentCrypt46 Yup... actually I think I had COVID-19 ... wasn‚Äôt fun but I would rather get it again then take a vaccine.
110360	Sorry!! Nope I will pass on this!! If you had this virus you don't need the vaccine. So therefore no vax for this chic.
111836	How to say nothing by saying something, if you recognize our vaccine, why then do we still need to isolate after two tests declaring us negative?
202285	Good news! My parents got their first Pfiizer dose last Monday in St Catharines; booster scheduled for July 5. #onpoli #pandemic #COVID19
111770	"Covid-19 isn't a hoax. The hoax is THIS; ""the only way to control it is a vaccine."" The vaccine is one way. there are other cures. The media and Government has convinced us that the only way to control its spread is the vaccine. THIS IS A LIE."
111351	What you fail to understand is that people will get sick either way. Your suggestion that we close everything down until the vaccine is distributed(which can take another year) People will get sick the best we can do is get as many vaccines and also up our hospital capacity.
108560	This makes me wonder. @realDonaldTrump gave endless briefings about ventilators. And we come to find out they weren‚Äôt necessary. In fact whistleblowers said they were actually killing people! Is the vaccine truly the new ventilator? Will it go unused because it‚Äôs dangerous? ü§î
112344	@normanswan Israel refused to grant the Coronavirus vaccine to the Palestinian prisoners in the occupation prisons
109777	@EdTufexis @JKPreachersgirl The *scientific twitter experts* are saying it could be the stronger symptoms some are having may indicate they would have had more severe Coronavirus. Doesn't make sense to me, *pretend twitter science expert*, because there is no coronavirus in the vaccine.
108213	@PattyD_2020 @BALLERINAPRO @conservmillen Covid-19 vaccine prevents acquiring or spreading airborne viruses. You can‚Äôt, it doesn‚Äôt exist. If you want to live your life in your happy little bubble go ahead, just don‚Äôt stomp on might right not to.
109927	If covid19 is really sensitive to summer heat, I am sure people will do whatever they can to postpone winter as much as they can, even if it took them to burn down all forests and open all factories or release every single carbon dioxide molecule. Vaccine will save us and Earth!
110254	@tentacle_tattoo that‚Äôs kind of my thinking, the worst thing the vaccine can do is give you coronavirus (even tho it doesn‚Äôt actually contain the virus but let‚Äôs just assume dumb shit)but you could also get coronavirus, which will do all the same stuff but 100x worse
110727	My #COVID19 #vaccine card is now squeezed in to my wallet between my Greggs and Starbucks loyalty cards. Which is most valuable?
112118	We can social distance all we want, but the Feds keep shipping in Covid like it‚Äôs a vaccine.The Brazil variant came from somewhere.  On something.  In someone.How dumb are we?  Are we @PattyHajdu stupid?  Is that even possible?#CdnCovid

202312	Damn that was a close call I hid needles filled with the vaccine in all my Halloween Candy this year.
111580	Same. There isnt a snowballs chance in hell I am putting a vaccine in my body that has been shoved through the system. If folks want to line up for it knowing that covid has a 99.98% survival rate as is, then knock yourselves out. Im gonna keep exercising and eating healthy.
109903	The new strains of the virus spreading across Europe and US will have devastating effect on the countries without access to vaccine. And eventually it will comes back to hurt us all. #Covidiots are going to make this #Pandemi go on forever with their short sighted stupidity.

110494	It‚Äôs going to dope when we keep testing things to get answers we already know to placate trump like how people keep feeling obligated study if vaccines cause autism
109735	It‚Äôs a crime to collect rainwater but this covid vaccine is free.. if something is free, you are the product.
202146	"Was that decided by ""who"" and what conspiracies was he paranoid about? When I shared that I got my vaccine, my close friend shared she believes the COVID-19 vaccine is putting microchips promoted by Gates and Left-wing POLITICIANS. She only watches Newsmax, Fox, &amp; Breitbart.NUTZ"
110784	These same people seem not to realize that we do not have vaccines for ANY, of the past pandemics, not H1N1, not AIDS (which is a Coronavirus). What idiot thinks wearing masks and social distancing is going to go on indefinitely? I still say it all goes away, Nov 4th.
202114	Have my second coronavirus vaccine shot scheduled Saturday..  It seems the Department of Justice will not give me due process in Calgary, Alberta due to scandal..  Just this afternoon the plaistering spies that bothered me in the Spring of 2020 moved into the containment chamber~
110451	How come no PLA officers died due to #CoronaVirus? Reason. They had a vaccine. And, Xi, Tedros lied to the world.
107963	"Translation:We told you masks would ""crush the virus"" and are ""as good as a vaccine"", but they didn't &amp; aren'tBut it's your fault for not wearing them correctlyNow that Covid is naturally waning, if you do this, we can take creditDon't ask why we didn't know this last May"
112550	Good business game this from #China first you invent the #Wuhanvirus then you make the Vaccines and sell the to the world just to make money #BoycottChina #BoycottChineseProducts #BoycottBeijing2022
201999	Awesome day today having a delayed #CanadaDay BBQ outdoor get together with some of our neighbours. Everyone has at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, some (myself, yay!) have both doses. Looking forward to when us fully vaccinated get back to normal in British Columbia.
112482	Is it true the AstraZeneca Oxford #COVID19 vaccine is not being tested against an inert placebo but against a meningococcal vaccine?Why? Because it hides side-effects.
202388	Fully fully vaxxed (2 weeks after my second dose today) with nearly 12,000 lovely COVID-19 antibodies. Definitely feeling much freer now and not using my sanitiser every 5 mins to the point that my hands go all dry, flaky, &amp; horrible.Yes to freedom and yes to the vaccines üôåüèª https://t.co/ozti6mJqsS
112486	@Godnose @fragrantfeline @ClarkeMicah there's no vaccine against the common cold, another coronavirus, but they tell us they can rush one through that'll defo work and be safe.
109500	@nytimes China only stamped out the coronavirus on their fake report. Without the cure, without the vaccine, there's no way to stamp the virus out. If you are positive but asymptomatic there, you're not counted as a confirmed case.
111557	@Blacklace40 The only way I'll consent to a vaccination is when I see the effects of the vaccine on white people like you because I'm not about to be a guinea pig. My fear is  due to COVID-19 impacting Blk Ppl in high percentages, they'll use us as test subjects. I'll pass. It'll be a while
112585	This is something logical, but is government going to wait till vaccine developed? or what would be the strategy to maintain minimum speading of virus.#lcokdown has shown us complete failure of administration control so far.#SpeakUpIndia #coronavirus @ndtv @MoHFW_INDIA
112706	Got my second covid-19 vaccine. Countdown started until my two weeks are done. Woo hoo!#covid19 #CovidVaccine
108354	I believe in vaccination for poor countries. But I‚Äôm honestly sick of seeing these articles already. It‚Äôs üíØ ethical for countries that developed the vaccines to provide it to their populations first. If in 6 months poor countries aren‚Äôt getting it then I will be upset.
112390	The spread in India is absolutely gnarly. The juxtaposition of everyone getting vaccines here, and the rapid spread there is crazy. #mavorg
111748	One nation in the world has decided to use Covid-19 and vaccines as a weapon, it'll come as no surprise to find out who it is.
108494	@berniespofforth I'm not a vegan.My vaccines are all up-to-date.My kids' vaccines are all up-to-date.I will take a COVID19 vaccine as soon as it is made available to me (I'm moderate risk as I am 50 and had lymphoma a few years back).Anyone that doesn't take vaccines is an entitled cunt IMO.
110501	If you want to understand how something will play out in the future, all you need to do is look into the past.Current #Covid19 vaccines don't reportedly prevent infections, only lower the severity of symptoms and complications if you get it. #VirusTheater NPIs are here to stay.
108834	"@CDCFlu the ""#coronavirus"" is a lie. There is no pandemic. Only the ""flu""-""vaccine"" causes the ""flu"". Eat broccoli every month, one whole crown, and you will never get sick. Brochitis is only possible for lack of fresh raw green vegetables, and being exposed to insects and dirt."
110378	Gonna get the vaccine then immediately head to the nearest karaoke bar to sing Shania Twain‚Äôs That Don‚Äôt Impress Me Much
201841	As a side note... YESTERDAY I GOT MY FIRST COVID-19 VACCINE SHOT! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Hell yeah! https://t.co/JVrYcXi5Fl
111801	This public service announcement is just for those who are on the fence, didn‚Äôt turn up for their appointment  because they are waiting for a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù one : Don‚Äôt wait. Don‚Äôt compare vaccine brands.Get whatever comes first. Cases are going up. So are mortality rates.
202419	Seriously though, the benefits outweigh the down time for a quick jab. Get vaccinated today! #COVID19 #vaccine
111259	@fourscoreand6 @JennaEllisEsq Meh, the vaccine has done nothing to save lives, and those who dont take it are no more or less a risk to others who do take it.there is no vaccine for coronavirus. If there was we would have cured the common cold.
110252	@muffnbear We need scientists to work overtime to create a vaccine for this so the antivaxxers worried about coronavirus can not take it.
112846	"@mtracey @jakemerci lol, omg, says a face diaper wearing zombie who will be first in line for the ""coronavirus"" vaccine üòπ"
110235	@WalshFreedom Why can one person take an aspirin and another person can Not take aspirin?But! Everyone can take the covid-19 vaccines?Please explain? If you can?
109718	Channel 3 in Thailand is reporting a Thai doctor has found a cure for Novel Coronavirus. It says he uses 3 vaccines:  1. Oseltamivir. This vaccine for MERS  2. Lopinavir This for AIDS  3. Ritonavia. For AIDS #journalism #Health #Wuhan #China # #media #Thailand #Coronavirus
111088	This is most likely propaganda but even if it wasn‚Äôt, why wouldn‚Äôt you just share vaccine information so everyone can have it? People are dying.
112606	In my view, there is a lot of fear among Christians masquerading as prudence or caution, especially as it relates to COVID-19 and the vaccines. David‚Äôs declaration is good advice today: ‚ÄúWhen I am afraid, I will trust in you.‚Äù (Psalm 56:3)
110119	No. They don't work against Covid. The vaccines are the reason we have variants happening. Our immune systems could wipe out COVID-19 in time.
108812	Mandates are not laws. Why this vaccine and none of the others? Chickenpox, Influenza, hepatitis, etc? Why not all vaccines in order to work? What is so special about this one? If you can still get and spread #COVID19. All the other vaccines work! Mandates are not laws.
111329	Why on earth wasn‚Äôt this publicized? Seems like a great PSA opportunity for vaccines, especially when 56% of Republicans won‚Äôt or are unsure about getting vaccine.
112389	@ed_hooven @NBSaphierMD Like I said, you clearly don't understand how vaccines work. If you did you'd understand ppl who have had covid19 don't need a vaccine.
110688	The Market is acting as if Intramuscular #COVID vaccines are all we need - this year perhaps / next year the nasal route will eliminate the need for mask wearing in those taking $ALT vaccine - strategic advantage.
109292	@Breaking911 Why the rush to vaccinate so many people with an experimental vaccine when most of us have this thing called an immune system &amp; if your healthy you will beat the coronavirus on your own. There are also CURES aka therapeutics- so vaccines are not needed, ppl need to wake up.
109745	I am fully vaccinated. But an injection the WHO needed to change the definition of ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù for is actually no vaccine!!! #Booster #coronavirus #virus #COVID19 #Impfstoff #vaccine
111785	Please @PramilaJayapal tell me again how great unions are. We pulled our kids out of SPS because it couldn't handle Covid. We're going to an independent school where vaccine and masks are mandated. We're lucky we can afford this option. Most cannot. But unions.
111273	@Telegraph Wearing Cotton Gloves and Masks can beat COVID-19 in two weeks. Health Experts don‚Äôt know the science on this but I know, physics measures are far better than vaccines. In May 2020, I swore that I'd like to accept the most severe penalties including death if my idea doesn't work.
111971	If a vaxxed person can get covid, and spread covid, then why would it be so important for healthcare workers to be vaxxed???
107951	@Elisabe88429520 @JeremyVineOn5 @dr_simon @theJeremyVine Im not worried about the planed covid19 never have been the vaccines don't work the booster is to make money off us they admitted it. It's funny how there's another v just before Christmas just like last Christmas where they lied l seen it coming months ago.
109638	Rapid testing is no panacea. LTC workers need to take the vaccine as condition of employment. @DrFullertonMPP, @TBayMOH, @DrBarbYaffe, @fordnation, @epdevilla, @JohnTory
111638	@RobertWilcher @allergic2da @defitillidie @libsoftiktok Why then has there NEVER been any vaccine for a coronavirus EVER?? This one is a huge FAIL
111338	If a #vaccine is to expose us to a virus in hopes our bodies create antibodies, then wouldn't our bodies already be doing this now assuming most of us have been in contact with the #virus?Therefore, why do we need a vaccine? #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS
110555	@EricAlanHanson @skilletmusic @ChrisHohnholz Also that's not what skillet is saying at all. They are saying they want the venue to give you a choice of either one, but this place in KC wants everyone vaccinated. Skillet just wants you to either have the vaccine or show a negative COVID-19 test
109960	@SergeyEinstein I'd just blackmail Bill Gates for them, he's got the vaccine for the CoronaVirus ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

110314	This would be huge. So many vets have underlying medical conditions - this ensures our veteran population is not overlooked in the vaccine rollout.
109764	@GeraldoRivera I recovered from COVID-19 GeraldoThere's absolutely no scientific reason for me get any vaccine ever Why are you so hush about this fact it's science and a fact Instead you clowns keep pushing a vaccine on people who don't need them
108155	@punditclass This is not the flu.  The reason why? Because if you get COVID-19 there is a chance you could have severe outcomes either short term (death) I guess natural immunity would not matter in this case, or long term. Both more severe than the vaccine.
109431	@wanthiskookaine @MrMcChicken22 @travisyost @washingtonpost A virus can weaken but it doesn‚Äôt have to. CoVid-19 is a novel virus but flu sometimes mutates to become deadly (except that we have vaccines to mitigate the risk and spread). Even if the bits of science were strung together in a truthful way‚Ä¶the timeline would still be unknown
111155	@QuestionEvery31 @3Hams1 @choo_ek Your logic is broken. Between 81% and 96% of recent coronavirus patients requiring in-patient care received no COVID-19 vaccine or are only partially vaccinated. They‚Äôre not overwhelming our health care system yet, but they prob will soon
110540	@praecipice @AndySwan @YossiGestetner @RonColeman At this point, yes. Maybe better vaccines will come along that are sterilizing for SARS-CoV-2, but that's not likely for any coronavirus. The vaccines are now 100% leaky. Hell, in my province, you have fewer chances to get COVID now by 30% if you are unvaccinated.
112600	@IngrahamAngle I said earlier, how come China with the world's largest population has had fewer Covid-19 infections than Chicago?  Jeez, are they lying about it or did they have a vaccine in place before they released the virus on the world? Asking for a friend in Wuhan.
110484	@senatemajldr Mitch please.Politicians have NOTHING 2 do with a vaccine. Scientists created it, not republicans. And you've got some nerve talking about baselessly undermining science. U enabled Trump 2 do JUST THAT since covid-19 started. Not 2 mention u don't believe in climate change...
111337	No one is safe until everyone is safe   When you get the chance, take the vaccine.  Thank you UKG and Oxford AstraZeneca.
110758	@AndrewBartlett So if the employee is unvaxxed, they could potentially sue the employer if they caught #COVID19 in the workplace, as the employer had a duty of care to protect them. Sometimes laws have to be made to protect people from their own stupidity, like safety goggles and hard hats.
107939	Can we all stop being fake outraged over members of our govt getting the #CovidVaccine already?  Is it a dick hypocritical move to be an #antimasker #COVID19 downplaying vaccine getter? Yes. They are govt though and if them getting it encourages their constituents, good! Move on!
112011	Just imagine when the vaccine comes out. The right will protest that too. These idiots are the reason why cases go up and we can't get out of this mess. the curfew is 10pm-5am. what would you be doing anyway?

With all the funding, we were able to develop and release a vaccine quicker not because it isn‚Äôt tested, but because we can skip all the legal stuff
112909	Question to you is how long u gonna wait like this? Is the human life on earth will be dependent on one vaccine (profit for Pharma co) after another? Or we wish to defeat it by inherent immune sys?

112224	@angie_rasmussen @BogusLobster When you have healthcare for all then you're going to get a country that is going to treat its citizens with the utmost respect and everyone will get the covid-19 vaccine. The US should be ashamed of itself. The US needs to have Healthcare for all and free vaccines for all.
110684	@rongejman I agree, but there hasn't been a global effort like this to work on a vaccine for one virus since maybe polio. Also, we know that it is possible to make vaccines for coronaviruses in general. See Merck's canine coronavirus vaccine.
111803	ü§£ And all the mask addicts will STILL get the vaccine, STILL wear the mask and STILL obey the lockdowns.  You see where they're going with this?  Anyone continuing to follow these mandates are suckers.
110127	@EthonRaptor @leahstokes Wife can't have vaccine.  I will test 1st. Someone else may need it. Don't want to deny them if I don't need it.  Have has over 20 exposures, may have had mild case. Or, I may be in the approx 1/3 who have immunity because of coronavirus cold.
109769	A Russian health care regulator has become the first in the world to approve a vaccine against the coronavirus, President Vladimir V. Putin said, though the vaccine has yet to complete clinical trials.
109289	@globalnews I will likely wait to see. This will be an extremely rushed vaccine with little to no testing as normally required. Plus there has yet to be a successful vaccine for any previous coronavirus strain (SARS, MERS) so how have they suddenly come up with one now?

111549	@Ramshaofficial Please don't do it.  1.  It is not a vaccine.  It is an RNA modifier which will change your bodies reaction to the next coronavirus exposure,  possibly creating a cytokine storm (an autoimmune response where your bodies defense system attacks the body).
109162	@FT I read the article as isn‚Äôt proven that the vaccine will actually work. ‚ÄúThe negotiations came as an international battle escalates among rich countries to buy up coronavirus remedies, often long before their effectiveness has been confirmed‚Äù.

110112	@JustinSchonie @LulawooBee @DrZweliMkhize I just took my child for immunisation a few weeks back. But I promise you, my family and I are not getting any rushed, unproven covid vaccine.

111703	@97McFly @CAPS_NAT1ON These vaccines aren't like that. They have mRNA that tells the body to make antibodies with the spikes that are just like the coronavirus. Only one company I believe is actually using dead virus in its vaccine and that one isn't on the market yet
112262	This is a disgustingly negligent statement/thread from the WHO, it would go against existing knowledge of how coronaviruses work and would guarantee a vaccine wouldn‚Äôt be worth trying out lol.

108879	So many people have taken the COViD-19 vaccine - over 150 million in the world, and nearly 1 million in Nigeria. Vaccine has not connected them to 5G, it has not put a chip in them. I have taken the vaccine, my parents ve too. We have not turned to zombie. @KNSMOH @KanoChronicle
107971	@scotgovhealth The NHS online service for coronavirus vaccine certification does not work. Having to call. Currently 255th in queue. Get it sorted out. This all because there was no thought to put a QR code on a letter like everywhere else did. Shambles.

202119	I'm happy that some of my friends are vaccinated but It's uncomfortable to see the disparity of vaccine between the West and the rest. I'm working with collaborators in Central, South East, South Asia. COVID-19 situations have not calmed down, with the second and third waves.
112214	@nastystacface @zibilith @TRyanGregory Hi, Stacey. There isn‚Äôt a vaccine for Covid for dogs right now. There is a Coronavirus vaccine often included with the DHPP vaccine - often written as DHPPCvk. That is a vaccine against a coronavirus, but not Covid. It‚Äôs a virus that causes diarrhea.
108424	@Steveofhope Exactly! And not everyone has the flu vaccine as low risk groups don‚Äôt need it, which will more than likely be the same situation when the Coronavirus one is available. We have herd immunity against flu as well.
109224	You see how they're not making the vaccine accessible? They're only open during bank hours and they are acting like the pandemic is over. It's literally not people's fault they aren't vaccinated.
109878	@ianhanomansing I got a call this morning from my doctor's office &amp; they are Only offering the Pfizer Vaccine... So yes I am going to take it bust mostly coz it's got the highest success rates out of all Covid19 Vaccinations

109961	I'm no conspiracy theorist but can someone explain to me how the flu vaccine, after all these years, is only 30/40% effective but the vaccines, to the never before seen deadliest virus ever, can be 90/95% effective announced the week after the election?   #CovidVaccine #covid19
112599	My dad makes ZERO sense. He is against the vaccine and masks. BUT He is worried about me and my mom going to a concert (Jonas Brothers) because of COVID. Makes this make sense. It just doesn‚Äôt make a bit of sense. #CovidVaccine #JonasBrothers #RememberThisTour #COVID19
110393	@AmassiPatricia @TorontoStar I am not going to take any of the vaccines, PERIOD!!!! Everyone dies eventually. If Covid-19 winds up to be the cause of my death, then that's the way the cookie crumbles
111452	@WHOISCONWAY, you had coronavirus back in early 2020. Are you feeling any longhaul symptoms? Did you end up taking the vaccine? Did you ever get corona a 2nd time?
202137	I finally got the first shot of the covid-19 vaccine, Russian one, known as Sputnik V. So far so good, still alive. They even let to take used empty ampoule as a souvenir. Nice )) https://t.co/0IGkQwGuNy

That‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg... scary stuff. #DownTheRabbitHoleWeGo
109804	This thread.You don‚Äôt have to agree with the views of these doctors but the scale of censorship should make you question just what the hell is behind all this.Why are we only being directed towards rushed vaccine treatment for a virus with such a low fatality rate?Wake up.

107885	@dockaurG It‚Äôs the elephant in the room. They don‚Äôt want people understand that the vaccines currently in production may not do everything we‚Äôve been promised. They may not be doing this out of malice - maybe to give people hope, but to ignore other solutions is just dangerous. #COVID19
108272	If viruses were sentient, they‚Äôd all be mightily pissed at coronavirus for crapping in their nest. They‚Äôd be cheering for a COVID vaccine so they‚Äôd get some action again.
112562	This vaccine appeared before everyone else, but it is still in short supply. Russia pays compensation to countries that did not wait for Sputnik V. Any other foreign vaccines are prohibited. What is this if not genocide?

Not doingso is a bad sign.
108923	okay so dr. fauci told us to take the vaccine so guess what we‚Äôre gonna do, friends. we‚Äôre gonna take the vaccine. #COVID19
110250	I guess Fauci made the coronavirus.The vaccine he recommends will makes next pandemic.The virus made in lab founded by Fauci.

110366	It‚Äôs a virus it‚Äôs never going away we need to learn to live with it just like flu,colds,streptococcus until a vaccine is found. Unfortunately a lot of people are going to die in the process.
112273	@bfriendmyles The mistake you are making, because you‚Äôre misinformed is you‚Äôre assuming a ‚Äòreaction‚Äô is bad. If you knew how vaccines worked you‚Äôd realise that a ‚Äòreaction‚Äô is your body building antibodies to the COVID-19 virus. day after vaccine I had fever, muscle aches, fatigue GOOD STUFF!
109856	@SRABrotherhood @BretWeinstein I mean, speaking for myself - I just didn't want to get COVID-19 with a naive immune system. I'm not panicking, just acting prudently. Now that everyone who wants a vaccine in the US can get one, I'm fine with letting it rip.

109825	@GoldSuzie considering coronavirus is related to the common cold. Cold virus mutates every two months, I don‚Äôt think in the Long run even the vaccines gonna work. It would‚Äôve been better for humanity if the virus is related to the flu, at least then it only mutates once every 12 month
111457	@kanonor @PrimeMinisterLS I'm not even there! I just want to know how far we are with procuring COVID-19 vaccines.
201908	@1blantdaddy I am not taking it. A priest died after getting one of the vaccines. Animals starting dying that had been injected too after the second shot. My brother and sister are 70 and 75. They both survived after getting Covid19. The shot could be worse than the disease.

108955	@JoeMDodd85 I‚Äôm not here to defend abortion, you don‚Äôt even know my position on it. We have vaccines for the flu, we don‚Äôt have a vaccine for the coronavirus yet. So what reasonable propositions do you have to limit the death rate of coronavirus that doesn‚Äôt involve masks in public places?
110029	@MAGA2020MAG @GavinNewsom FACT - Covid-19 is in the human pop. 4 good, fast or slowFACT - mask wearing only slows it down; it can't stop itFACT - herd immunity doesn't mean that no one will ever catch it again, it just reduces the likelihoodFACT - there has NEVER been a vaccine for a coronavirus. EVER.
108765	#CNNTownHall could this particular strain of Covid-19 change? If so, how would this be trackable in coming up with a vaccine?
111404	On 6th October 2020 (almost eight months ago), I've pre-ordered a PS5.Today, I've received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Still waiting for the PlayStation.Now, this is absolutely the *correct* ordering of the priorities, but I didn't expect it to go this way.
109536	@danwootton @RossjournoClark Why does no one listen to the experts? Its a coronavirus. This is a variation of the common cold not a flu. A vaccine will only help 50%. Any immunity fades after a short time. There can be no herd immunity without a vaccine.
110810	@KingGeorgeNY @John_Gkinis25 @MAGAPATRIOT34 @EtherealRose456 @NYGovCuomo FFS!! A vaccine gives you the same antibodies without you actually getting the virus and either dying or having severe damage to body. Aldo it will take years before covid19 infects enough ppl to have herd immunity. Why are so many Americans so dumb??
109704	@thehill Then make sure they don‚Äôt get the vaccine until everyone else does first. And insurance companies shouldn‚Äôt cover any of their COVID-19 expenses for this reckless behavior.
108471	@Reuters Why? Every vaccinated person can contract and spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The vaccine is said to only protect the vaccinated person against severe symptoms of Covid-19 disease ‚Äî not against catching the virus. Any vaccine requirement for travel is insane.
111970	@Q__on2_it_yet__ The Flu Vaccine contains Coronavirus. This Plandemic has been planned many years in advance. Don‚Äôt ever take a vaccine again. Don‚Äôt ever allow children to have a vaccine ever.
109056	@DrClarinval @WHO there is no vaccine, in Kazakhstan there is very weak medicine and besides the authorities hide the true statistics on COVID-19 from the world community, and @WHO in #Kazakhstan Nazarbayev's regime has attracted their side and they repeat their words.
108139	This is why the @Pfizer potion is NOT a vaccine.  NO ANTIGEN is contained therein.  Same for #Moderna.The potion uses manmade mRNA to reprogram human cells to make the protein which then triggers the immune system to produce antibodies.What could possibly go wrong?
108246	@OfficialDGISPR Sir why PAKISTAN not participate in clinical trial of coronavirus vaccine with China.
109906	@PeterHotez Hello I have an important question for you - I received the J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccine a month ago out of town and now locally I am being offered the Pfizer vaccine. Is there any harm in getting a second dose this way?
111189	Sounds like they understand the vaccine really doesn‚Äôt protect us from shit, it‚Äôs never gonna end, &amp; mutations will keep happening. Now they‚Äôre talking about 3 rounds of booster shots. Why? because they know it‚Äôs not going away. Vaccine or not. Boosters or not.
111543	If mass vaccinations will not stop the virus, then what's the point of them? Why wouldn't I just keep wearing my mask then? #vaccine #vaccination #COVID19 #CovidVaccine
110836	I know the virus is real I know the vaccine will help a lot of people but I am not taking the vaccine remember I am scientist and I do things for a reason because nobody not going to tell me what the f*** to do

111843	If the vaccine produces 100% immunity, as the Mayo Clinic states, then it would prevent kids from spreading it because they wouldn't have it in the first place.

110354	You think the travel industry, like airlines, for example, would require vaccinations because more people would feel comfortable flying and that's good for the bottom line. Like I don't understand why they don't require vaccines or a negative COVID-19 test.
108840	i think if anyone is immune to the coronavirus it would be steve-o, scientists should use his blood for a vaccine immediately
109113	We don‚Äôt need a vaccine, we need to strength our immune systems (eat organic NO GMO), make sure you have enough vitamins D &amp; C (second stage of covid is actually acute scurvy). Practice good personal hygiene. I wouldn‚Äôt trust any vaccine now esp knowing what Billy Gates
108245	It took the election of democrat @JoeBiden to get the vaccine out the door. Good job, Joe!Vote blue in GA to keep the good news coming! #gapol
112286	If you don't believe the medical profession about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, then please be consistent and stay home when you get sick.  The hospital would just treat you with the medical science you're ignoring.
108186	Sooooooooooooo, you think a president has a power to command us to take a vaccine that might be dangerous?Would you be so gung ho if this was Trump commanding YOU to take that vaccine?Inquiring minds want to know.
111916	This is the game changer - it is vastly cheaper then the 2 dose vaccines, easily distributed and administered. It may be lagged behind in terms of supply to Canada but has incredible possibilities for managing infection in the general population. #greatnewsonafriday
111086	@yesnicksearcy @OutNow45 NOVEL coronavirus. The fact that our vaccines show any efficacy against strains that didn't exist until after they were created, trialed, and submitted for EUA is impressive. Their mRNA platform will also minimize turnaround for new versions if needed.Great indeed.
107924	The coronavirus vaccines will probably prevent you from getting sick with Covid-19. But it‚Äôs not yet clear whether you can still get infected asymptomatically and silently spread the virus.-NYT
108217	I know it‚Äôs easy to panic when these headlines come across our timelines, but an entire arsenal of vaccine candidates is slowly building up.Shots on goal approach has never been more valuable than it is right now. Hopefully this is just a bump in the road for one candidate.

110276	@MihrThakar Can you choose which arm you get the COVID-19 vaccine in?The answer is a simple yes. Just like any other vaccine, you can also choose which arm you get the COVID-19 vaccine in.
111440	Not what you originally told us, Matt. Nothing like it whatsever. And we may never get a viable vaccine, so will you hold us back forever? Who gave you that right? Absolutely no one. I see there is a clear reason why you eschew parliamentary scrutiny, so desperately needed now.
110075	Great to see @KizzyPhD  and @BarneyGrahamMD continued to recognized for their work on coronavirus vaccine.Well deserved.
111461	@AstorAaron Agree with David, disagree with Aaron. Vaccine mandates are vital. Masking is important until enough of the population is vaccinated. We're not there yet. Covid-19 is a bad actor. It can enter the brain/other organs and cause long term problems--problems that will tax our system.
111571	@RpublicRestored Bill Gates wants something in the COVID-19 vaccine that will tell if we‚Äôve gotten the vaccine. I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt trust that and I‚Äôd bet it will track us as well.
107743	It will be free because the population will be the test subjects to observe the long term effects the vaccine has, unless they've been testing this since 2015 there is not a chance I'd be getting this vaccine basically a guinea pig for some multi billion dollar corporation.
110334	Genuinely can't wrap my mind around how bafflingly, absurdly, unquestionably stupid you have to be after the last year to not get the vaccine.

108951	@InterBang @PeterHotez @maggiemfox @CNN Is not my intention to spoil something. I want to know what are we talking about. So we count to the huge number of Covid19 in USA also the asymptomatic, but say vaccine is effective in 90%, when this number is valid only for symptomatic and this with specific criteria?
108324	I did read that the mu variant may not be as infectious as the Alpha or Delta variant, but it is concerning if the mu variant is resistant to vaccines since it could thwart the progress made there.

111512	@ronnytodgers @andrew_croxford Yes, and that may be the problem. When they tested previous coronavirus vaccines on ferrets - which had excellent antibody response from the vaccine - they died when exposed to the wild virus. That is why there has been no successful coronavirus vaccine to date.

112873	@bigron2000 If I do get Covid-19 I will get better the natural way without going out to get a vaccine that doesn‚Äôt work and has fatal side effects. I‚Äôd actually rather die from Bill Gates and Fauci‚Äôs superbug than get vaccinated with god knows what.
109215	@basboon007 @thehill You understand that MRNA has been around for a while, just hadn‚Äôt been used as a coronavirus vaccine since before this pandemic there was never a coronavirus vaccine. Any vaccine regardless of the platform would by definition be experimental? Do you just ignore all data?
111501	You mean like #vaccines and how #Americans are so spoiled that they‚Äôre literally turning away not one but 3 FREE medical tool options that will save millions on this planet? When there are countries that would just be grateful for ONE? #PerspectivesAreKey
111835	@ForAllTheMarble @LegalizeitLala Pork is a harborer of many virus'. It is a dirty meat and different coronavirus' are often present. It's so toxic it is illegal to transport pig manure across State lines. Flu vaccine is another big link. Gelatin in any vax is from pork too. Plus the mass pig killings in China
112803	Even Regular flu vaccines don‚Äôt protect against all strains and variations of flu circulating each year. They try to target the most like one to spread widely or do the most damage. Close is not enough in viruses.

110051	Adam got his first round of the Coronavirus vaccine. He goes back in April for the other shot. This means there's a 90% chance the kids will be going back to school this coming school year. It's going to be so weird! (And I'll miss not being sick from the stuff they bring home!)
111734	So they believe in the science of an antibody test but they don't believe in the science of a vaccine? Seems stupid enough.
111827	@EricROlson @sciencentric How long would a vaccine be effective? Since we have seen how wildly differently the COVID-19 virus has impacted people around the world, is there a one vaccine fits all remedy?
110259	What is this bullshit?  They don't know how long you are protected from the vaccine either.  The key would be how long it takes the virus to mutate, and when it does if it is even still contagious to humans.  We don't know that yet.

111643	Thanks Terry Bradshaw. I don‚Äôt care if Rodgers didn‚Äôt take the vaccine, but just be honest about it and follow the rules/protocols.
107908	I'm surely not #antivax . I don't believe the #COVID19 vaccines are safe for me; they're not effective for some people (as we're now seeing); and after being lied to for the last 21 months about how deadly the disease is, to how effective and lasting natural immunity is etc.
109603	@Independent Only the creation of effective and safe vaccines will be able to control the coronavirus. Until this happens the world will not return to the old normal
108545	Covid-19 vaccines arrived yesterday in Italy, but i don't trust it, it seems so un-tested!What do you guys think of it?Btw i'm not gonna take it for now, i prefere to let others try it first
202339	Hey all. I got the vaccine yesterday. Today I feel like I got run over by a light-duty truck. It was the first dose, but because I had a rough case of COVID-19 back in January, I expected to not feel great. One of my Covid symptoms was a feeling like shingles over my sides.
111667	@GovInslee How long will your segregational and discriminatory policies be in effect?If everyone has access to the vaccine, and you believe vaccines work, then WHY is this necessary?#RevokeInsleesEmergencyPowershttps://t.co/KfSkfMOC59
202364	Christmas came early this year! I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to receive the COVID-19 vaccine today. Feeling so thankful! üòäüôåüèº
110279	@patrick2278t @KTLA NONSENSE quit listening to AM radio nuts! Immunity from COVID-19 in NOT long lasting enough for a non-vaccine herd immunity to work. Notice how New Zealand did a great jut with a non-pharmaceutical containment?
112444	After further research and analysis, I have determined that CSL most likely added a component from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because they were attempting to develop a coronavirus vaccine would be a safe and effective for treating patients with an immunodeficiency.
112457	@realDonaldTrump Ready to be honest about this?  The task force has falsely led people to believe a vaccine makes it all magically better.  If they knew distancing and masks would still be in play would they still be advocating lockdowns and now school?
107802	So @CompComSA most def needs an urgent COVID-19 Vaccine (internal) premptive pricing task team.Help out at @HealthZA and @SAHPRA1Laws needed to PRICE ASSESS BEFORE WE SPEND THE MONEY. Justify the price, or price variations. Prove it is low or no profit. And, not time bound.
202423	#IGotTheShot! After 21 days, I got my second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. ‚ú®üíâSo thankful for this opportunity and hoping that many more in my community continue getting vaccinated to reduce their risk of COVID-19 disease! https://t.co/puhOpHhAQn

111793	@AlanPattersonMD @davidmackau There has never been an effective vaccine for any coronavirus and there never will be because they mutate.  Our immune systems are quite capable of dealing with it, as long as we are healthy. You should be promoting weight loss, fitness and a healthy diet. Not this nonsense.
112367	When is @MountSinaiNYC going to be giving vaccines to their patients? Patients that receive their care there should get their vaccine there too. Honestly what‚Äôs the hold up? #vaccine #ny #mountsinai #COVID19 #nyc #COVID19Vaccine @NYCMayorsOffice @NYCMayor @311
201864	wtf covid-19 vaccine's a disaster... and I saw the image of my president getting a vaccine the other day. Dear God, let nothing happen.
109020	Unless you are actually willing to enforce this, it is a pointless gesture and you should just hold out in your homes and pray for a vaccine. Stock up on food and toilet paper, it's about to get nasty.
112261	Moderna coronavirus vaccines will arrive in Canada's territories on December 28th.That is, provided there aren't any snowstorms or other weather issues.So, just days after Christmas, needles will likely be going into arms in the North.
108537	@Funnytrousers @EthicalRenewal @DanielFooksArt But you won't NOT catch anything like a coronavirus just cos you had it before in the same way a vaccine won't. This narrative &amp; whole muddled speak around the complete issue is the most blatantly confusing and divisive ploy I've ever seen. And there's plenty of them going around

109372	@jerrymwd @barbaras1616 @GovMurphy lol coronavirus has been here since the 60s and no vaccines for any of them and people just think we're going to get one for this one?  Time to build up that immunity and get on with our lives.  Long overdo.
111554	Since O****d rejected my graduate application I shall similarly reject any Covid-19 vaccine developed by them.

109911	2) The answer is simply: they don‚Äôt want to know why, nor do they care (despite constantly saying how they wish they could understand). They‚Äòd rather perpetuate the narrative that divides us and demonizes anyone who even questions the #vaccine &amp; #covid19 polices. Not constuctive
112552	@EdHull8 I think they‚Äôll come up for a vaccine for COVID-19 before they discover a vaccine for Trump. So...
107853	The irony in all this is she was finally going to get the vaccine Monday but got sick the night before
112601	When it comes to this vaccine.I will not take it! The only way you will get me to take it is to physically hold me down and jab it in me. If you do that I will defend myself.Digest and decide your next move.#COVID19
202363	My friend had 2 shots got covid ended up in the hospital with pneumonia brain fog. She thought she was going to die. Get the booster.
109946	Why this panic and coercion of the common people in such a high-handed manner to get covid-19 vaccines pumped into their bodies, when they have Good Innate Immunity and, thereby, they just don't need them, at all. Isn't this Vaccine terrorism?
202201	I've signed up at a local pharmacy as well to receive my #AstraZenaca vaccine and I hope to get an appointment soon. Every person vaccinated gets us one step closer to bringing this pandemic to a close. If you're eligible, please sign up today for your first dose!
202265	@HSELive how can I do to obtain proof that I received my 1st vaccine shot? I am abroad and need to provide evidence of my 1st shot (date, vaccine type, etc) to book my 2nd shot and have it done abroad. I don't have my Covid-19 vaccination record card with me.
112316	@Frank__Davies Their is a #armsRace to get vaccines for #COVID19 much like the space race but with industrial spies
112144	@LMakhetloane @MawandeMothibe Also, there will be seasonal changes to the virus, just like what happens with influenza viruses. That's why there's a yearly flu vaccine available and I suspect the same will happen with this coronavirus.
109306	@PhilipRucker Trump doesn't get all this credit.  Coronaviruses have been around and Covid-19 is a variation. 17 yrs ago, they started working on a vaccine for SARS which is a coronavirus.  That's why it was done so quickly...it was halfway there when scientists tweaked for C-19.
202032	Week finished. I have now gotten my 2nd dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine, and my certificate from my middle school has came in. Thank you @PoeMiddleSchool for the last 3 years. https://t.co/IPt5UrXquL
108305	Excellent news , 10 days it starts.?  and if the Tory and SNP governments get there act together everyone could should have the vaccine within 4 weeks and back to normal, now that would be a happy New year , we have 3 vaccines JUST GIVE THE PEOPLE THE VACCINE .....!
107894	@zerohedge Not surprising. There will be endless shots ahead. Covid-19 virus and vaccine turns on to be an effective way to significantly reduce world population. Enjoy
107777	Am I missing something with this Pfizer SARS-2 coronavirus vaccine announcement, because I've yet to hear anyone say how long it's effective. 3 months? 6 months? A year? For life? Anyone? Seems like this is a critical detail.
112648	@bruceymonkey @kimbikeskc @vicc_nicolee @warofthesuburbs We've never been able to develop a single anti-viral or vaccine for any coronavirus. Even after worldwide infections of SARS, MERS and 15% of the common cold every year.Yet we can make one for a novel coronavirus within months? Draw your own conclusions.
108074	Accept this fact that historically it took avenge 11 years 2develop a vaccine. Secondly gene based technology is new with no proven history so it should take more time then normal technology. Otherwise vaccines will take more life‚Äôs then #coronavirus @Iamsamirarora @ETNOWlive
201987	Evelyn does not visit me in Welland due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.  All my vaccine shots were given.  I also got my seasonal Flu shot.  I did get my booster shot.  I have selected to stay away from any bar.  sometimes I go to restaurants.  MacDonalds is a very short walk away.
112407	@JenJoeGibson @Joannew68022274 @spunawebxx Covid has never been isolated.The virus is a normal coronavirus no more dangerous than the flu.Will you be queuing to get your kids jabbed with an unlicenced, untested and unneeded vaccine?
109422	I just spoke to a close friend in the medical field who said there may be an issue with the Covid19 vaccine.  Denmark is rumored to have an issue with covid-19 mutating from Animal exposure and is making the vaccine ineffective.  This news has me anxiety ridden.
107694	@PhilipWatson_ This is what we do about anti-vaxxers: No job. No entry. No NHS accessBeing coughed on by someone with coronavirus is not my idea of freedom. Those refusing a vaccine must face the consequences. The rest of us have rights too, including the right to life
110000	Going to get my COVID-19 vaccine booster a little later today. Excited to try my best to keep myself and those around me healthy. Will share updates on its effects on me to show folks as to what its like. My 2nd shot wore me out for 24 hours, but was otherwise fine for reference.
109801	My guess is you better have a damn good answer to question No. 5:‚ÄúIf you have ever received a FDA  approved vaccine ... please explain how your sincerely held religious belief ... causes you to object to the COVID-19 vaccine compared to other vaccines you received.‚Äù
108364	@bernhardsulzer @CalebJHull Riddle me this? Why is it that VAERS is actually saying that the vaccine for Covid19, or The Coof, The China Virus, The Pandemic, etc whatever you call it. The Gov Funded VAERS is saying the Vaccine is actually killing more people than any other Vaccine made in the past 15 years.

110323	@ReddCoach @itschappy @btbarnes11 The vaccine is a treatment. Just like the flu vaccine.There is no immunity, natural or otherwise to a coronavirus.
112145	Someone should explain to @chrisreykdal how vaccines work.You see, w/the EUA COVID-19 Vaccines, they just tell your body to spike protein antibodies.This is like throwing caps in those ring toss games.  Sometimes one will make it on the bottle.But, you still get sick

108308	I get being apprehensive over getting the COVID vaccine. But to say it took less than a year to develop is misleading. Yes it did take less than a year, but why? It‚Äôs because they were not starting from ground zero. SARS and MERS are also a type of coronavirus

109710	@RWMaloneMD Pandemics have run their course in the past without vaccines. In fact, no coronavirus/flu outbreak has ever been ended by a vaccine. They've all just run their course.But in 2021, the experts aver that the only way out is through intervention. It isn't honest.
108695	This new strain so so bad, that they're happy to roll out the same vaccine as they say its still effective... ü§î If you live in Wales don't listen to this clown
108454	@WattersWorld @JesseBWatters Jesse,Here is an idea for a segment, but it will really take time to achieve. How many medical personnel, doctors, nurses, etc. have died because of the covid-19 vaccine? The vaccine has been called by virologists, a gene therapy! You need to be very cautious.Fr.

110244	When we make individualistic decisions related to #COVID19--e.g., not getting vaccinated because of risks it may pose to us, hoarding vaccines to protect only ourselves--instead of considering the common good, the situation worsens. ...It's almost like there's a lesson in there.
109279	Thomas is right: ‚ÄòGet jabbed! It‚Äôs so important to get jabbed as we head into winter. It‚Äôs so quick...‚ÄôQuick? Why did Thomas have to wait months for this *important* jab?@nadhimzahawi @sajidjavid why did you deliberately allow Covid to infect his friends and classmates?

110707	Uk approved Oxford/Ashtrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine today. It isn‚Äôt expensive and can be stored in normal freez temperature unlike Fizer/biontec. It‚Äôs not a vaccine, it is a ray of Hope.....May Allah calm the world....

108370	the pope has explicitly taught that catholics may take the COVID-19 vaccine in good conscience. for a bishop to teach that they can‚Äôt is flat opposition to the teaching authority vested in the successor of peter
111123	Lol. There's no sars or mers vaccine yet. But sure, there's going to be a COVID19 vaccine...next year.
108754	we're going to have the Covid-19 vaccine next year and then i get to go to all the restaurants with my family!! :D
110754	So, I'm just 1 week away from getting the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Just so you know, I hope it's less scarier than the first one. Again, wish me luck! üòä
109136	We can marvel at great technological and medical advances, and hope these vaccines are a game changer. Yet, never forget, there is nothing as miraculous as the dedication, empathy and selflessness of people like this. They are what hope looks like.

201917	One for all and all for one. Let‚Äôs kick COVID-19 in the ass and get this world headed in the right direction. I just wish this had been the case from the very start of developing these vaccines.
107715	Then why did all of you say you would never take a vaccine developed under Trump? You said it would kill people.
110620	It‚Äôs just going to be really hard - if not impossible - to gather in public or in private - and not pass this stuff all over the place.  This spread is a new ballgame.  I hope it‚Äôs a less dangerous variant and it might be just that but I wouldn‚Äôt roll the dice.  I‚Äôd get the jab.
110640	@udaysubbarayan I think Covid can be controlled to allow in-person work if there is regular boosting (until a sterilizing vaccine is developed) and masking if community spread is high. Best case scenario is Covid burns itself out to be a benign circulating coronavirus, but probably not likely.
111929	I took the COVID-19 vaccines, but later found out they can weaken the immune system. I'm not taking anymore vaccines for Covid 19. They'll keep coming up with vaccine after vaccine. Don't trust Fauci, and the CDC
112739	By the time the vaccine is available for me I'll know if it is safe or it turns you into Zombies. If safe I will especially if it will keep my Friends and Family safe.
202352	Got the first dose of the #CovidVaccine at Meadowlands megasite. Some tips- don‚Äôt get in line until your time is called! Dress warm &amp; bring a book. They were behind schedule but the site was impressive and well run. Thanks to all the volunteers! #COVID19
112375	@rabbisolomons @WHO Maybe vaccine regulations are not made to deal with pandemic emergencies and need updating. The Russians may cut corners but they‚Äôve had Sputnik so they‚Äôre not exactly stupid. I just don‚Äôt know except to distrust government on coronavirus as my default position
108451	Horrifying thought: what if there are too many antivaxxers still around when the coronavirus vaccine comes out?
108758	I know what happened! They realized that if kids don't go back to school, they won't make their millions on all those mandatory school vaccines.  $$$

202172	I have never been so moved by the sight of trucks. I want to bang my pots and pans out the windows in gratitude to all of the scientists, manufacturers, research participants (I'm looking at you, vaccine volunteers) and drivers who are making this incredible moment possible.
112694	Keep an eye out for the recorded session - you do not want to miss this as it has great information regarding staying safe and connected during the holidays as well as general information about exposure, isolation, testing, and the COVID vaccine.

109428	@jackieohughes @LynneMWhite1 @christopherhope @YouGov Again, conjecture. Currently there is no consensus that ANYONE had any immunity to THIS coronavirus. This is why people who have the flu jab can still get other coronaviruses etc.

112559	@rupasubramanya @EricTopol @UKHSA We need COVAXIN in our arsenal against #Covid19 pandemic.  As a whole-virion inactivated vaccine,it is anticipated COVAXIN would produce an immune response against multiple antigens present in the SARS-CoV-2 virus,such as spike and nucleoprotein antibodies. Ask the FDA about it.

112906	@jamiedupree I am guessing that the GOP faithful will use this to say the vaccines don‚Äôt work so no use getting it. Also that the CDC said the vaccine would stop COVID-19 but it didn‚Äôt, so they lie and we should not listen to them on masks either.

111047	The coronavirus vaccines have only been developed for a year. No one knows if it will be safe for the next 10 or 20 years. It's a hoax that they are safe.

111552	@JenTromans @o_rips Actually he is claiming that the new Covid-19 vaccine will cause GB. Believe it or not, that just isn't true. Covid-19 infections can cause a resurgence in people who have had it or currently do, but not the vaccine. Honestly anti-vaxxers blow my mind.
112045	@EddieRNashton Where‚Äôs your evidence you can be reinfected? Getting infected by delta and then Omicron is two different viruses so not ‚Äúreinfected‚Äù. The common cold is a coronavirus.

201915	#OnTheNews: Talking about employers mandating employees to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Don‚Äôt know about you, but I really do not like mandates. Especially when it comes to MY healthcare.

108738	@my_own_RESEARCH @MockDelbourne @SmallRedOne That‚Äôs not what she is saying - once the world has been exposed to the virus (via vaccine or infection), the IFR will most likely trend similar to influenza, if not less.  Yes, this is horrible and a terrible experience for all of us, but structurally, this is a coronavirus.
111369	You are NOT safe from COVID-19 after you've had it -- just like you aren't safe from the flu after you've had it. The flu changes so you can catch it again. COVID changed and will again. That's why vaccines exist; because our bodies can't achieve immunity alone.Get vaccinated.
109834	I'm not rooting against the COVID Vaccine, because I do think they have a purpose for those that are vulnerable....but this is not good.

201952	@Marumo_Mokgaga @HealthZA But procedure and training we got more especially for this covid19 vaccine. The whole thing is just so wrong.
109246	Oh wait I think I know, it's because when you get the real coronavirus then you usually don't feel any symptoms within the first 2 weeks of infection. So that means the vaccine is working the way it should.
110302	@SilVeRWiNg947 @GatekeeperLabs @NatGeo Coronavirus vaccine is an 'RNA' vaccine, the first of it's type. You can't post videos of 'DNA' vaccines. It's not relevant to this story as it's a different technology.Please, do some research...

108238	Isn‚Äôt this going against all of their established safety protocols? How did 18 months go to 12? They don‚Äôt even have a viable vaccine yet. WTF? I think I‚Äôd hold off.
108383	No way the coronavirus industry ever wants this pandemic to end...it is a near quandary for all of us, save for the vaccines
110749	@sr_patrick Actually I have some information on that subject. I thought originally that covid and the flu are just separate coronaviruses has but apparently the flu is NOT a coronavirus so it's a totally separate vaccine according to a pharmacist I talked to you last week.
111685	"@realDonaldTrump May 8th (80,202) Trump's says,""The coronavirus is ‚Äúgoing to go away without a vaccine ‚Ä¶ &amp; we‚Äôre not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time.‚ÄùJune 17th (122,632)October 30th (235,159)Trump &amp; family hold Covid spreadfests around the USA.They don't care!"
111585	@refinedmanxxx @DominicEvans23 @EscapeEUSlavery SARS 1 didn‚Äôt have a vaccine neither did MERS. Both just disappeared. There has never been a vaccine or anti viral for any Coronavirus. They have be a few out breaks in the last 20 years
111786	Hey Camel Toe....there is now a vaccine that our President has ushered in so you need to pipe down and plan to lose BIGLY...  Oh, and I am not planning on wearing a mask today or any day so there is that....JS
109984	@toad_spotted We're going to have to figure out another way to make babies anyway. The coronavirus vaccine is going to sterilize everybody.
201950	@PoorFlyingMan @NeilClark66 You've got it bad my friend. Try and digest the fact that 130,000,000 injections have achieved nothingThat's jab inefficiency.Then the complications, like myocarditis &amp; Clotting etc.Read the covid surveillance report.More likely to die of covid19 if jabbed üòï
111868	We are getting started on the vaccine deployment that we promised.  It will take time.  But we are getting started.
110325	@helpmebcatholic @cmsorrps4610 @FrMatthewLC 1\ A mutated version of COVID19 will not make the necessity of vaccination moot. It might make the vaccine slightly less effective is all.Yes, COVID19 has already mutated slightly this year but I've seen no evidence that it will seasonally mutate like the flu.
112055	So, if a non-US country develops a vaccine first, then the US will just have to cross its fingers and hope for the benevolence of countries and organizations that our government has spent the last 7 months antagonizing...
112698	Absolutely disgusting. Who in their right mind would volunteer their child for vaccine trials? #VaccinesHarm
110058	I don‚Äôt understand why y‚Äôall go through all this trouble to fake a covid vaccine card (then not do it correctly and get caught) when you could just, and hear me out‚Ä¶.GET THE VACCINE.
109100	"Children will be able to overrule their parents and get the coronavirus vaccine if they are deemed ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù to do so, a minister revealed today.They've repeated the line ""listen to the science"" the full time, scientists advise against it yet ministers are still pushing"
202215	So . . . my crystal ball was correct for the very first time during the entire pandemic.  Today, #SCOTUS sunk the #OSHAETS mandate, but threw a lifeline to the #CMS vaccine mandate so it could be enforced.  I just wish #covid19 knew the difference! https://t.co/Y4850uFLnZ
107793	@CNN No one can legally force another to take vaccine in US but its their own lives and no one can assured that vaccine is 100% safe without side effect in years to come but if they aren't careful with SOP and catch covid-19 and then die, it's their own funeral anyway.
110003	Croydon is one of the first places to receive doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. Croydon residents, will you be getting the vaccine when it is offered? #croydon #vaccine #croydonvaccine #CovidVaccine
202424	@kig_root Sound great, I saw COVID-19 vaccinations center and nurse vaccine my arm final afternoon ago
108456	@sdr_medco The way orange moron handled this pandemic, most likely. Also it will probably be another 18 months (thereabout) before we actually do have a legit med or vaccine for Covid19, &amp; as long as moron opens biz and veto stay home, virus is not going away. Why doesnt he get it?
109747	PCR tests don't fucken work just like those fricken masks why are they still wearing one if they have the jab,please explain fucktards.
109248	Lmao. We've been sitting around waiting for a vaccine knowing damn well they're gonna make sure it's unaffordable when they figure it out.
109332	We don't need a #Vaccine against #Coronavirus #Covid19 #Covid1984.We need a vaccine against government.
111465	@ElectBlakeMoore @darrenforutah Q: Would you take the COVID-19 vaccine if it became available?Both CD1 candidates say they would. #utpol
111442	3/ tried to develop the vaccine for the previous 2 famous coronaviruses, SARS and MERS? Ever wondered why there is no vaccine for those (or any other coronavirus)? It's just because.The pharma companies have said it is safe and when companies that stand to make so much money...
108790	@Jajafinance it's still not working. My details are correct, but the app and website keep saying they're not, and getting through to you on the phone is nigh on impossible. Any other suggestions?#EpicFail #JaJaBanks
201883	Biked (with son, who got his second COVID-19 shot yesterday) to Walgreens at Woodfords and got booster. You should get booster, too.
112110	Ohhh... I really want to see a vaccine but I don't know if I want to be a guinea pig (read: am brave enough).
112594	@PorcupinePink @julesspaceman @afowler06 Coronavirus vaccine has been around almost 2 decades and studied for far longer. SARS and then MERS both coronavirus have vaccines. Covid or SARS-Cov-2 is a just a new strain of corona virus which is why the turn around for a vaccine was so quick.
109376	If the coronavirus vaccine works I wonder if it would work on the haunta virus? I think that's how you spell it
108052	It's like David Icke was sayingThey can make up any symptoms for this virus to enforce a new ruleThen they will do the same for vaccine deaths
202133	I just took my 87 year old mother, for her COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, at the federal location on Waters in Tampa, she was asked to present her ID during EVERY step of the vaccine process, I feel I should be upset, because, asking for an ID is so racistüò¨
111477	@PeterHotez Personally, I like my vaccine aged in oak barrels to really bring out the flavor of coronavirus
202073	So sad another one of the #AntiVaxxers died of #COVID19.I loved #Meatloaf music, but this was just a moronic waste.Get the #vaccine people!#VaccinesWork #VaccineDeaths
110681	"** PUBIC ANNOUNCEMENT **Just yesterday the hospital where I work in Germany passed a circular that said ""All unvaccinated workers must either now take the Vaccine OR get tested for COVID-19 on a daily basis OR stay home and not get paid..."
112099	"My prediction for a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. is that half of the country will be main lining it while screaming, ""I don't care what it does, I'm ready to challenge God!"" while the other half will be hiding out in the Utah desert ranting about how 5G is in it or something."
107767	COVID-19 may not completely go away even with a vaccine, but hopefully it‚Äôs not concerned a pandemic soon. üôèüèª I‚Äôd like life to get back to normal üòä
201893	@SteveSchmidtSES Steve Schmidt you are consistently my coronavirus vaccine for my mind against all the crazy in this Administration
202300	Many elderly folk have spent months missing family. Today, my Ma was visited by her GP for the 2nd time &amp; given her 2nd vaccine. #COVID19 She was delighted. Bravo, bravo Health Boards clever enough to think this one through. It was worth any #gpvaccinepayment Thank you #NHS
109618	One of my concerns about the coronavirus strand in UK is how it will impact the roll out of  the vaccine.
202390	Outstanding work led my @meganbcole @BUSPH. Thank you for invitation to participate. FQHCs are helping the country reach sought after #CovidVaccine equity goals. Cc: @The_BMC @MA_CEAL
109102	@TammiFire31 @my2greatgirls @DevinNunes I don't watch MSM either.  I follow epidemiologist on here and read from different sources.  The coronavirus is NOT the flu, which has a vaccine and antiviral meds. The swine flu caused an elementary school to close 3 weeks in Houston.
201935	I am ready to call for vaccination centre for my first COVID-19 jab!! 8am it opens. Let‚Äôs hope I can get through today
111070	@ABC  Keep the Virus thing going just when all those that took the Vaccine, both doses, are in the Hospitals with the Virus.  So now we are going to push this one Huh.  Can't go without a Virus a Month Plan...
110046	I hope parents are watching carefully‚Ä¶ why are they trying to do this ‚Äúquickly ‚Äú? Why do they want this in your kids‚Ä¶ you can not undo this vaccine!
107824	If #Trump and his #magasheep don't believe in the #coronavirus,  why such a rush to get a vaccine? Who are the guinea pigs? #TrumpVirus #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #GOPGestapo
112146	Despite your personal beliefs and political standpoints, I think we can all agree that if a safe and effective vaccine is actually distributed starting in October, that would be great. I mean the least we can do is hope.. right? #cppCOM1101
111900	When does it END? THEY HAVE NO PLANS ON AN ENDING. It is about the money! If after 3 jabs + future ones AND pills. It DOES NOT AND WILL NOT WORK!
112187	Why don‚Äôt you trust doctors and nurses? This is why. You have no business being in the medical industry having anti-vax beliefs. Plus, I‚Äôm happy watching nurses in the US get fired or quit their jobs over this vaccine. We don‚Äôt want you treating us.
109835	Except it‚Äôs nothing like the measles vaccine, is it?I had all the aforementioned vaccines too. As far as I‚Äôm aware, they were actually safe and effective with years of clinical data to back that up.
202320	What a Friday! Did a two-hour interview on medical history and living through a pandemic this morning, and this afternoon I'm off to get my covid19 vaccine!
108333	"People are getting mad at this for no reason. If someone mocks vaccines then it's okay to mock their death. Just seems like generic twitter contrarianism to go ""no actually, we need to mourn this guy who was putting everyone in danger by not getting vaccinated"". Fuck off"
112717	@paulofthewoods0 You‚Äôd be correct if by ‚Äúvaccines work‚Äù you mean they are 100% effective. Unfortunately coronavirus vaccines (like the flu) are not. That does not mean they are useless either. That‚Äôs why the more people take it the more effective it is overall.
110281	Vaccine or No Vaccine?Not being close to the top of the list will make that decision for the majority of us so don't trip.If there's any issues with the vaccine, they'll be known before it's our turn to get the shot(s).#COVID19 #CovidVaccine
109329	@WendyLo86145831 I agree... people should say if they want to be vaccinated or not... some countries - like Germany - using vaccines from different countries... hope all vaccines are good and helpful, and the coronavirus can be controlled the way its possible.
111668	You advertise for vaccines. Lol I doubt the average person is going to believe a word you say. Conflicted.
111368	If COVID-19 was as apparent in humans, there would be zero vaccine hesitancy. Still, COVID-19 is probably more devastating on the human population than the worm is on the snail population.
111756	@DrRPNishank Please sir postpone neet itna I am covid19 positive my parents will meet me to make me approach center and they have some health issues if you postpone neet the vaccine will be available in one or two months and please postpone neet I have lost interest in my life I am beggingsir
111313	How convenient China creates the virus, covers it up, and now China may be the first to have a vaccine#ChinaMustPay #COVID19 #WuhanVirus #Trump2020
112193	@LeeSovaClaypool I don't think we should widely distribute any COVID-19 vaccines that are developed...it wouldn't be fair to the people who've already died from the pandemic. üôÑ
110109	Why does J&amp;J need to repeat every day how vaccines are going to save humanity? If they were so good you wouldn't need to spend millions every day to advertise it.
112348	If anyone has any doubt about how effective the Covid-19 vaccines COULD be if everyone got them, in the state of Indiana...
109363	Good explanation of why this is NOT a conspiracy re the AZ vaccine. (And loved the yogurt analogy - vindicated !!)
201848	Yesterday, I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The fine folks working at the Circuit of the Americas site did a great job of making the process seamless and easy. I'm extremely grateful for all that went into this and feel hope for the first time in a while.
109268	"So the Science Minister doesn't know if CSL actually has the ability to actually manufacture a Covid-19 vaccine if one is found? She's been ""advised it could be possible""... Jesus. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è#insiders"
