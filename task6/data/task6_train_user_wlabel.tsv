104700	If Pfizer believes we need a booster shot, we need it. Who knows their product better? Following the guidance of @CDCgov is how I wound up w/ Covid-19 and having to shut down my K-2 classroom for an entire week.

108270	@NightmareHolic @eretserus @elonmusk Human herd immunity is the only effective vaccine. It’s the only way this virus goes away for good. You can only create a vaccine for one strain of this thing at a time. I’d also love to see any evidence of any vaccine working against any previous coronavirus.	Vaccine_chatter
104210	It is still unclear when a COVID-19 vaccine would be approved for use or be distributed. Banner Health will independently validate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine before it is administered. (21/25)	Vaccine_chatter

101851	Perhaps when there's a COVID-19 vaccine in the coming months (or years), it can help countries like Pakistan increase national immunization stats if routine immunization is coupled with the virus jab/drops. Should the state, however, make vaccination a mandatory citizenship duty?	Vaccine_chatter
106548	I only got the flu shot twice in my life &amp; I don’t plan on getting it this year. They so busy with a vaccine for the coronavirus, who knows if they’re even paying attention to which flu strain will be out this year. Not saying there’s not multiple labs to accommodate but 🤷🏽‍♀️	Vaccine_chatter
102454	I'm guessing they will be going the discovery route and buying the vaccines from the department of health. Knowing the WC, they'll pretend they bought them independently 🤦‍♀️.

103153	Isn’t it incentive enough to help humanity &amp; get the vaccine? I think offering $200 to employees to take the shot is offensive considering the 300,000+ who died because they didn’t have an similar opportunity in time. I will never advocate for this in The Village.	Vaccine_chatter

107248	@AudreyManaster2 This is how the new vaccine will be produced, I think with changes in the coronavirus DNA genomes and why in some trials now they've been halted due to test human subjects having serious reactions. Why a rushed vaccine could have devastating effects. My assumption from readings.	Vaccine_chatter
111023	@HHwfc @Cris_Without_H @radude6 @BBCWorld Yes, but the MRNA vaccine has been in development for a decade.

104889	This “mandate” is trash, an unnecessary detour to the inevitable, life with Covid, much like the seasonal flu.

106108	@Liz_Wheeler No, no he isn't. There's a high likelihood (though not yet conclusively proven) that we can protect vaccine-intolerant people from contracting COVID-19 if enough of us receive the vaccine, including our healthy kids. Herd immunity is basic vaccine science.	Vaccine_chatter

103065	@US_FDA Polls indicate that approximately 40% of Americans will REFUSE to get a COVID-19 vaccine. If the FDA approves a vaccine that has NOT completed Phase 3 trials an even greater % of Americans will NOT get a vaccine. Politics should NOT play ANY role in vaccine approval.	Vaccine_chatter

111330	@scoot3r83 Given what we already know about covid I think there is sufficient data to say the vaccines are “relatively safe and effective”. Far from perfect but a great tool against covid19 and it’s complications. As for mandates, I don’t think they’re a good idea. No one should be forced.	Vaccine_chatter
102489	@MitchWheeler19 @CP24 An effective vaccine for a Coronavirus is almost laughable. Coronaviruses (including the common cold) tend to mutate quickly and develop hundreds of strains, and immunity doesn't last long after you get them.  Ever wonder why there's no SARS or MERS or Common Cold vaccine?	Vaccine_chatter

110292	@lyndsay_hopkins @janekin24 @SirGrahamBrady This has been bewildering for a year. Why r some calling it covid, others coronavirus, the Pfizer injection called a vaccine when it is a synthetic pathogen, amazingly can now be given 3 months apart rather than the recommended 3 weeks? This is all made up stuff on a daily basis.	Vaccine_chatter
110888	@pauldundas85 @ChrisLynnPhoto @ShelaghFogarty Covid vaccines MAY be associated with chronic auto immune conditions.
