5038	1297909635693842433	@aishatyler I'm not sure if know, this man had a record of domestic violence. If that's the case I don't feel sorry for him. Men that are accused of domestic violence usually hit their kids and wives.	0.0
5039	1258857016153554945	@Folmes Are women the only victims of domestic violence? I bet a lot more men are assaulted by women than vice versa they just don‚Äôt report it. Regardless of if it‚Äôs man on woman, woman on man, man on man or woman on woman violence it‚Äôs not right and shouldn‚Äôt happen.	0.0

5041	1285648357856288768	@notyourvessel I understand that is how it looks, I used to have the same viewpoint. This is a crucial point that I learned in the domestic violence courses. No one can control what another person says or does. If they did the person trying to control the other person would be abusive	0.0
5042	1318413778145275909	@cats4worldpeace @creeptwin Oh, this person is definitely using su*cide threats to try and manipulate my partner into being her friend. It's clearly an abuse tactic in this situation.	0.0
5043	1247645108930920449	@SilvernaeS I'm really sorry for the abuse that you're currently undergoing however, my best advise would be for you to reach out to a local domestic violence shelter, or contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFECall: 800-799-SAFE (7233) -JJ	0.0

There's a huge difference between ""smaller woman has to use technique to beat larger man"" and whatever the fuck that Sexy Star angle in LU was where she was ""fighting for women"" and then got the shit kicked out of her in what I can only describe as domestic abuse porn"	0.0

Domestic Abuse is now the main item on the agenda, which is horrifying. 

Hampshire Police is the lowest funded Constabulary, yet covers a vast area."	0.0

5050	1365677544524177411	Fall 2020, I had to cut ties with my business partner and friend because of her toxic behavior and constant gaslighting. Huge financial loss for me. But more important, it hurts so much. I miss our friendship and work everyday. But I can‚Äôt allow anyone to abuse me like she did. twitter.com/ayy_mizzy/stat‚Ä¶	0.0
5051	1275540014764453888	@9NewsAUS I‚Äôm so sick of this being called ‚Äúgendered‚Äù violence. There is so much domestic violence aimed at men too, yet their voices are often silenced or they‚Äôre told to ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù. This just reiterates that mentality and it‚Äôs so wrong. Domestic violence is wrong on ALL levels!!	0.0
5052	1266017598258532352	@MajakIsaiah @d20fitness @ChiefDavidRoddy 1/2 I thought so too until the other day. The other cops gave him cover to kill that man for almost 10 fucking minutes. Until the police have zero tolerance for racism, violent history (ie domestic abuse etc) and full vetting to keep CRIMINALS off the force they are ALL complicit	0.0
