11001,"Everybody developa cataracts with age. Diseases like diabetes may make you develop them faster. you're 55 and diabetic, it would be more of a surprise if you had absolutely no sign of any cataract than if you were to have a very early one. even though your prescription has more numbers due to astigmatism, the overall power is relatively stable. why the quotes around ""doctor"" from Lenscrafters? They still earned a doctor of optometry degree. It seems to me that you're saying you need help seeing literally all distances. A progressive would be able to provide you with all that range of distances. ",0

11004,"Dear doctor of optometrists of the internet I am asking advice based on multiple different opinions. Firstly I have two optometrists due to one having all my history and one recently that performs a more comprehensive exam. The one with my history told me I'd be more eligible and satisfied with icl, whereas my new optometrist said lasik. Me being a worrier and avid researcher when making decisions went in for multiple consults. I had 3 lasik places that gave me the label of B- on candidacy and 1 that told me I was too borderline for it. They told me it was one and done procedure due to my high myopia. I'm 28 going on 29 Male My script is L -8.75 sph -1.25 cyl Axis 180 R -7.25 sph -2.00 cyl axis 180. My K value was 46 for both eyes where they said I'd be 38 post op. Corneal thickness was 556 preop with 320 on my left and high 330s for my right. They set a treatment optic zone of 6.0. With lasik my concerns would be dry eye, ectasia, and night glare that may not be treatable and also outcomes you guys have seen with patients with high myopia treated with lasik because I'm hoping you guys have insight. ICL was recommended due to its reversibility and less complications of dry eye and night vision problems also possibility of enhancement. My concern with icl is glaucoma. My great grandmother on of my dads mom and my moms dad had it. My eye pressure is around 19-20 mmHg. I have been told by all refractive surgery centers I'm in a unique position as I am a decent candidate for all. But lasik or prk would be a one time treatment. And I've been told to not due prk due to haze. In terms of stabilization I was a -7.5 L and -6.5 right at 18. With same astigmatism. At 27 I got -8.0 L and - 7.0 R. After not wearing contacts for examination I got the new script which was apparently due to my cornea going back to normal shape. I use to wear toric soft lenses. Also I had lattice degeneration that was treated with laser by my retina specialist he said no other complications exist in terms of macula or optic nerve. I guess I'm kind of lost on the decision to make and wondering what professionals have seen with high myopic patients in terms of refractive surgery. ",1
11005,"If you have sharp vision without correction, please dont get it, or atleast wait to see if you progress a fair bit. The quality of life hit is so overwhelming after CXL if you have a good UCVA. Uncorrected vision is actually super important in life.. swimming pools, hospital visits, flying on a plane etc. Glasses won't do much after CXL and you will have a melting blur at a certain distance that can only be corrected with super advanced sclerals. The only CXL i would get is IVMED-80 and that hasn't arrived, yet. Getting a 2nd opinion is also a good idea. ",0
11006,I was diagnosed in my late 20s and have no family history of KCN. I also have terrible migraines and was on topiramate for many years starting in my early 20s. Does topiramate contribute to corneal changes and potentially exacerbate or even cause KCN? ,0
11007,"Hello, I've been briefly scanning this thread and I was hoping to have some answers from those directly affected by Sjogrens Syndrome... This will be sort of long in explanation but I'm generally discomforted and concerned. To begin, I'm 18/F. Auto Immune disorders like Lupus and RA have been running in my family for some time and I've been experiencing symptoms that a doctor had suggested could be caused by Sjogrens. This is a severe diagnosis and my family members with Lupus explained it's taken them years to be officially diagnosed and that I should be concerned and get into contact with a rheumatologist. I wondered if it was worth it for my symptoms and if diagnosis was equally hard with Sjogrens like Lupus or if it's a true negative no matter what ? What finally lead to an official diagnosis for you all and what qualifies as enough in your opinion to seek a specialist? I experience the sensation of dry nose, throat mouth and eyes (occasionally itchiness of my eyes) causing my head to hurt, I'll randomly become dizzy and pressure will accumulate around my face. It's at its worst when I wake up and when Im trying to sleep, however still very prominent throughout my day and noticeable. The best way I could describe it, is that it burns to breathe through my nose like things are too cold or not wet enough and it makes a dry, painful sensation in my throat despite posnasal drip. It irritates my mouth and eyes, feeling like I woke up with Cotton Mouth or I'm hung over. I struggle swallowing, making it hard to sleep as I constantly feel like there's a lump in my throat, I feel like I'm choking when my nose suddenly is dry and no longer ""clear""<U+009D>. It'll occasionally hurt to talk too long and I constantly have a dry cough because I'm always trying to subconsciously fix it. It's like feeling winded and having a dry spot in your throat from not swallowing enough so you constantly do it to fix it. It also makes me feel as though I swallow food down the wrong tube. I was only prompted with this diagnosis after being irritated enough to think I had Strep Throat and further explaining my symptoms. The test came back negative. On and off for the last year or two, I've exhibited these symptoms accompanied by weird facial burning like a sunburn sensation, excessive heartburn, occasional dizziness and aching of places where I've had broken bones prior or my joints, most generally being in my arms and legs. It has brief periods where it's barely noticeable and it's not a raging irritation. It's not that it hurts painfully bad usually, but rather its very mild and seems never ending enough for me to despise it and not ignore it. I was tested for Lupus, Sjogrens and RA all of which came back negative so my doctors are trying to move on (which is great if there's an actual solution) but I know how long it took my relatives to officially be diagnosed or finally dismissed. However, I'm still so uncomfortable and now my doctors seem to be testing me for things that don't exactly make sense as a whole like Influenza or Lyme. They've also attributed my symptoms to be caused by anxiety and stress as I have a lot going on however, if anyone in this thread knows what anxiety dryness, numbness/weakness or throat irritation is like, you'll too, know that it's not the same as what I'm describing- it being that it's not a response to adrenaline or worrying. What I experience is rather constant. (As for the lab tests, I'll have the results Monday the 13th) My symptoms fluctuate in intensity and lately my body is becoming less dry as I think it's overcoming the intensity from this ""flare""<U+009D> as my aunt with Lupus suggests. I still have the sensation of dryness 2/3 times but there's clearly moisture in at least my mouth right now. Like my mouth for example, it's usually extremely dry due to my nose being dry and it leads to dry eye and pain in my face. Now it seems to be less intense. (I don't know if that's from the help of biotene or eye drops however). It was a strong few months of it climaxing to its worst and my symptoms by no means have completely subsided. I recognize what I'm feeling from this time last year and from when i suspect that it's began as a whole, the end of summer both years in a row, now. I do have seasonal allergies but they present with congestion, pressure in different places... so I've ruled that out. Also is it normal to have dry crusty sensation in the nose and eyes even with some moisture being present? Sounds silly, I know... and does anyone find that the more water they drink the headache increases or that spit becomes more thick and harder to swallow?.. Ive tried sinus meds, eye drops that sometimes burn but usually feel so relieving ( meant for moisture) saline spray which dries me out and burns- I now use something specifically for moisture but I feel like it just drops to my throat and irritates, I've tried cold and flu meds... I constantly moisturize as I've struggled with dry skin since I was a little girl and still my skin gets patchy or my lips will peel and crack ( I use chapsticks and scrubs like it's my job! It makes no sense)... I drink upwards of two gallons of water trying to remain comfortable, using biotene sprays and eye drops and coconut oil for moisture. I take ibuprofen for pain and use heating pads for pain as well. A Humidifier is present and I try to keep room on the colder side. I have central air heating. Hydration is very important to me as it's been an irritant in my life for a long time, suddenly it doesn't seem as effective as normal. I do not drink coffee and I've cut out smoking or vaping for 4-5 months now. I was hoping to see if my symptoms are still valid of Sjogrens or if maybe there's hope for something else less serious that I could bring up in an appointment for those of you who had their Sjogrens misdiagnosed originally? Maybe I'm experiencing symptoms of something else. More blatantly said, I'm not looking for a diagnosis but, rather, I'm trying to become more educated on the topic as I'm losing sleep from the irritation, constant urination and am generally very discomforted all day. Online research is hard and cryptic in my opinion, as well as not always accurate. I figured asking real people would be more beneficial. I'm open to any and all suggestions if you've read this far. The best to you all who struggle with an Auto Immune issue especially Sjogrens. Thanks again!! Please ask any questions you may need for a better understanding, I'm very desperate as health issues spark my anxiousness and work me up lol I'm sorry if I sound dumb or should be asking in a different subreddit.

11008,"I think mine is considered to be mild. I'm not sure though. It developed in my late 20's. Since I started wearing RGP lenses, my vision seems to have stabilized. So CXL is not recommended for me. ",0
11009,"I got diagnosed 10 yrs ago as a teen, have been through nearly everything. I second diet and supplement treatment, as I tried plaquenil and had more negatives than positive. I've come to terms that my Sjogren's isn't going away, but if I can prolong the best of my health then I will. With plaquenil, I was cranky/snippy all the time, more sensitive to sunlight (became practically a hermit), and severe tummy issues. I had less joint pain, but that was about it. I've found the right supplement mix with the help of a naturopath, and sticking to a balanced diet has allowed for long-term steady health. I found the Mediterranean diet was best for me (though I skip the wine part); I stay away from inflammatory foods like red meat, rather sticking to anti-inflammatory stuff like garlic, turmeric, etc. I really like fish for the omega-3s. And I drink a shitton of water too. Obviously, I'm not a doctor, so check in with a doctor first if you can. Also, I do have a pre-hypothyroidism situation going on, and it seems that the neck lumps is a concern of yours based on other comments. I take a supplement to pull back on that and get my thyroid back to normal, and that has helped my jawline come back a bit. I'd advise asking a doctor to check on other autoimmune or thyroid issues as well, as where there's one autoimmune issue, there's more stuff going on. Lastly, I know that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but acupuncture has helped me the most with gland reduction and proper salivation, to a point my dentist pointed it out at my regular checkup after starting acu treatments. My chronic pain has also definitely gone way down. I'm very lucky in that my insurance covers it, and it's definitely not for everyone, just my experience. Everybody's bodies are different, and a lot of folks with autoimmune issues tend to have a fun lil cocktail of stuff going on. Find a doctor you trust who's willing to figure out your situation and determine the best fit for your needs. If you're interested in more natural remedies, I recommend a naturopath. If you prefer Western medicine and get more benefits from plaquenil, a primary care doc and *especially* a rheumatologist are your best bet. ",0
11010,Ok so I came back from the retina specialist today. He diagnosed me with a mild hyphema and I am treating it as we speak. I'm not nervous about the hyphema but about the possibility of getting glaucoma. I am only 15 and I never had any eye problems. I was hit with a ball. I heard if pressure is built up for a while it can cause glaucoma. My vision actually came back a few hours after trauma but when I was trying to go to bed I think the hyphema bled again. My vision was blurry again. It was already midnight so I just slept on it. When I woke up it was still blurry so I immediately went to the eye doc in the morning. He said my eye pressure was super high and gave me eye drops to bring it down. Today I went to the retina specialist and he said I had no viewable retina damage. (Took an ultrasound) and also didn't think there was any optic nerve damage. My peripheral vision is not black or cut off I still have my full field of vision but everything is blurry. The blurriness has gotten a little better. Which the doc said is the blood from hyphema but I just wanna ask you guys if it could possibly be glaucoma and if I should ask. ,1
11011,"Your need for glasses is determined by your genetic heritage and epigenetic stressors in your environment. Meaning, that what physical traits you inherit can influence how your eye develops. Also, how much time you spend outdoors, how long you read, and how close you hold the material to your eyes can all have an influence on the development of your vision. Even such things as allergies, and eye rubbing could cause deterioration in vision over time (keratoconus is one example). These are just some of the epigenetic factors that can influence vision development. Most eye doctors don't prescribe glasses to people who don't need them. Unfortunately, there's always a few bad apples in every profession; if you're the victim of one, you have my sympathies. In spite of that, I doubt your glasses had anything to do with you developing worsening vision over the last 10 years. In other words, correlation does not imply causation, it's a common logical fallacy. The good news, wearing glasses have not damaged your eyes. ",0

11025,"I was rootless until I got my celiac dx. Once I got in a very early listserve support group online, I found out how so many of us back then had been left undiagnosed for a long period of time. There were commonly people who were sick all their lives and nearly expired by the time they were diagnosed. I had about the average wait then, which was about 13 years. My sense of self what ruined; I doubted everything I felt and saw. What a mess. But once I saw how there is no dx tree that doesn't end in ""you have depression and are too anxious about your health,"" I figured out what was wrong next (hyperthyroidism) and found the best specialist group in my area by checking on who in the local medical systems was publishing on thyroid disease. I couldn't get into the top specialist so I worked with someone in her group who read my tests wrong and thought I was getting better when I was getting worse. He didn't seem to realize that the sign """" before the left range number meant that the amount was too small to be measurable. So my TSH was .001 on one test from one lab and .04 on a test from his lab. He thought that mean that my TSH was improving by 4000%. No. It meant my TSH was too small to be measured at one time. This was a doctor, a specialist, ffs, with more education than I'll ever be well enough to attain. So, I called the medical group's office and came in to talk. When I explained what had happened and they put me with the main doctor who was actually publishing research on Graves' disease (autoimmune cause of hyperthyroidism). When I explained to her what her associate had done, her face turned beet-red in anger and she went to the next room and yelled at the guy. At this time I'd been hyperT for about 5 months and was in imminent danger of having a fatal heart event. Yadda yadda yadda, I got my diagnosis before that week was out.

I have had glasses since I was 10, 36 now. After my Dx I started seeing a Cornea doc. Every 6 months for 2 years, then yearly for the next 6 years, now I go every 2 years. Since my Dx my vision has not changed, I wear acuvue oasis soft contacts (-2.75 each eye), and get close to 20/20, I also have fine correction with my glasses. My KC topography has been the same since my first scan. So it's very mild and naturally stable. Likely from eye rubbing as a kid from my bad allergies. Recently I have been reading some peer reviewed articles about KC and ICL. The results seem very promising for a case such as mine. I compared my topography numbers with the subjects and I am well within the parameters they published in all the articles. So anyway I found a Cornea specialist who does all the various corrective procedures including ICL. I just stopped wearing my contacts and see him for a consultation in 2 weeks. I am not getting all hopeful, just curious about how 10 years has advanced this stuff.

Sleep etc can do that, it will calm down. The scelra does appear normal IMO, many many people if not all adults do infact have slate/blue corners of scelra.

11040,Hi. I developed a 1mm peripheral corneal ulcer on Friday morning from accidentally sleeping in my contacts one night. I have now been on two forms of antibiotics since then and today the doctor told me to start steroid drops to reduce the scar and mild corneal inflammation. I'm a little afraid to start the drops (prednilosone 1%) because I've recorded high IOP a few times and I'm terrified of getting glaucoma. My IOP ranges from 18-22 but I have thick corneas and normal visual fields. I'm healthy 22 white female with no family history of glaucoma but I do have moderate myopia. I'm going to get checked again on Wednesday and my doc said they would monitor it. I know I should just trust them but I struggle a bit with OCD and glaucoma really scares me. I'm also curious how likely it is for that little white ulcer dot to stay forever? Thank you so much for your time and help. I really appreciate it. ,1
11041,"That last sentence sounds like the optometrist thinks you were 'overminused' in your original Rx. From the optometrists I work with, it's quite easy to overminus myopes because sometimes as patients, we report that a power that is too strong is the best one when an optometrist is refracting us on the phoropter. I myself was overminused once, so that's why I think you've gone 'down' a half dioptre in the sphere. Of course it's something to avoid because it can give you headaches and feeling like you're straining but it does happen Your astigmatism correction hasn't increased a wide amount at all, it seems quite regular to me. Most people's prescriptions stabilise around late teens to mid 20s. Mine has only just started stabilising (turning 21). I've dispensed glasses for patients whose prescriptions are still changing in their early 30s and aren't presbyopic or having any pathology. So it is variable so referencing your title - nope your Rx change isn't too big for your age. Good luck with dental school and look into contacts if you haven't already, your specs must be quite thick at the edges. Although when you write about the original values having a BC of 4, BC means base curve to me which is a value I associate with contacts? But I'm Australian and our base curves are like 8.4 and 8.6 which is lots larger than 4 lol. maybe different unit of measurement. ",1

11043,"Hi there :) I'm really sorry you are going through this, but you are going in the right direction. To realise that something is wrong is the most important part of the journey. Now you just need to find the right rheumatologist. I'm saying ""right"" because not every doctor will be convinced that you need help, especially if your tests are negative I was diagnosed about a year ago. I'm 33 now. Before that it was a never ending battle between me and the doctors. All my tests were negative so I was ""totally fine"". The only thing that convinced my rheumatologist that i do have sjogren's was my lip biopsy. It proved it. So I think you should start with that. Lip biopsy can't be wrong. If you have sjogren's even in it's beginning stage, it will show it. I was just like you once. Living with all my issues thinking that it's ""normal "". It's not normal. Life is so much better when you know how to manage your illness. Now I fight fiercely for my health and no doctor can tell me that I'm imagining things. As for plaquenil, I started taking it as soon as I got diagnosed. I'm also taking prednisolone and naproxen for pain management. I don't know what other symptoms you have so you decide if you need medications or not. I have severe joint pain and fatigue, so these medications really help. Also these medications stop the progression of the disease. If the disease doesn't progress you don't develop lymphoma. Or at least that's what I was told. Honestly, I don't see any harm in taking plaquenil, but prednisolone is pure evel. Horrible side effects. Doesn't worth it. Vitamins, omega 3, good diet and exercise are the best way to start. If you don't have worse symptoms than your dryness then maybe you don't need to start plaquenil right away. First you have to find a good rheumatologist and do that lip biopsy. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Best of luck to you and stay healthy. ",1
11044,"Hi, I am a 35 F and was diagnosed with CFS 5 years ago. I was just told today that I might have Sjogren's my blood was taken and I was told my blood my not show that I have it even if I do. I am just trying to see if there is a link with symptoms I have been having for many years. My feet fall asleep often and when they wake back up they hurt so bad and I am in able to walk until the pain has stopped and my feet are not longer numb. The pain I experience feels like 1000's a needles are being stabbed all at once into my feet. My hands go numb while I sleep which wakes me up and freaks me out but I experience no pain at all in my hands just numbness. I have been waking up daily with blurred vision, it takes me 5+ minutes in the morning for my vision to become normal. I also often feel like my throat is closing, I have no trouble breathing and no sore throat, just the feeling that my throat is closing. I also have also experienced vag dryness for years and now I'm getting chronic vag yeast infections and no one can seem to figure out why. I do have bladder issues, I can never feel like I don't have to pee and I have to go to the bathroom multiple times at night. I also have chronic headaches and dizzy spells. Over the last 5 months my memory has become horrible and I keep forgetting things and get confused easily. I also suffer from debilitating fatigue.

11047,Hello to everyone! I have a question for any doctors or anyone with a similar experience to mine. This is going to be a hefty post but please bear with me. I live in CA and I am 24 years old. It has been almost a year since I had my surgery for my retinal detachment and I have slowly gained enough courage to try to go for my license (kinda weird I didn't go for it when I was younger I know). I mentioned to my doctor that I was interested in getting my drivers license and would it be safe since I don't want to put myself or others at any risk due to my eye. He said I could but I have to make sure that he fills out a form with the dmv for the vision test. I've been checking the dmv guidelines for the vision screening and I'm wondering is it possible to get the form right off the bat since I know I will likely fail the vision test and be told to get my eyesight checked? How did you fare through this whole ordeal? I know that guidelines are different state to state but regardless I'd like to know what steps you took (for those of you who have retinal detachment) or advice you gave to someone with retinal detachment when they went to go for their drivers license or renewal (for those of you who are doctors)? Any advice or comments would be very helpful!! Thank you. ,1

11050,Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with amblyopia and keratoconus last week when i went to a consult in an attempt to join the military. I am honestly really sad and in disbelief that i have keratoconus. When i was 16 i went to an eye doctor and he performed and eye exam and did not diagnose me with keratoconus at all. Just amblyopia. Is there a possibility of a misdiagnosis? I don't think i have keratoconus. I don't really have any of the symptoms mentioned of keratoconus and my corneas look fine. I would like to go to an eye doctor and get an eye exam but i don't think i can afford it. I have no insurance and nor do my parents either and i'm afraid of burdening them with costs. Any help and advice would be appreciated. Thank you. ,0
11051,"Here is my story. Extremely farsighted as a kid (early 60's) and in glasses. Diagnosed with KC in 1968 and 1970, age 14 and 16. Eye check at school sent me to an optometrist who sent me to an ophthalmologist. All they had back then was RGP lenses. No such thing as CXL or Sclearals. Graduated high school, college and got half a masters degree with RGP's. Had cornea transplants in 1980 and 1982. Cataract surgery 1998 and 1999. One was not successful. The lens implant came out of the capsule and was floating on my retina. I then had a vitrectomy to remove the lens and put another one in. This surgery caused Strabismus and over the period of a year had 4 Occlunum injections into the eye muscle. After all of this, my corneal grafts made it through just fine. I have been in glasses ever since. I retired from my occupation in 2012 and am living a normal life. All I have to do is put my glasses on just like a normal person Saw my doctor on the 13th. My 38 and 40 year old grafts are still clear healthy and I am seeing 20/25 and20/40 in glasses. Next dr apt scheduled in a year. No, my case is not usual and grafts this old are NOT normal. Yes, all our experiences are not the same. Hope you do as well as I. ",0
11052,"I've had a consistent prescription for about 20 years and have excellent vision (corrected). My previous glasses have started to fall apart, so I went to a highly recommended optometrist (i.e. not a discount shop or a Costco/Walmart) to get new glasses. My exam showed that my previous prescription is fine. My prescription is -3.75, -3.50 spherical (no cylinders, no progressives, etc). Upon receiving my new glasses, I noted a vertical line of distortion approx 5-10<U+00B0> off my visual center, away from the center of my face in both lenses - the right being more noticeable. This vertical line causes images to blur, but as I turn past it the image returns to the same level of sharpness as my visual center. Eventually, the image blurs as expected heading toward the edge of the lens. My guess would be that the index of refraction is slightly different here - a degree or two wide. When marking this effect on my lens, it is about 1 cm out from my optical center (i.e. not an edge distortion). The effect is less noticeable up close (like reading a book), but very noticeable driving or looking at fine detail beyond about 10 ft or so (e.g. tv screen across room, map on wall). Additionally, my right eye is slightly blurry, mostly in distance vision (beyond the \~10 ft range). When looking anywhere but up close, its causes my vision to be distracting - like I need to rub my eye and clear it up. As expected, when using only my right eye the blurriness is much more noticeable than when combined, but still aggravating when using both eyes. Oddly, I inadvertently noticed while rubbing my eye, that when my glasses slide up so the nose piece rested on top of my nose, my vision becomes sharp in both eyes. Marking on the lens, this is about 2 cm out and 2 cm down from optical center. I don't know if that matters, but I figured I'd mention it as my my vision is great in that position, but it obviously looks ridiculous. I've returned to the opticians multiple times. They remanufactured the lenses thinking there was some sort of defect multiple times. I did note a slight improvement on the left side, but its really hard to compare as each remake has been about a month apart. I'd had to argue with them a bit to explain that I wasn't talking about edge distortion and get them to actually listen to what I described. I've also been told it is because my lenses are wider, so I am looking through more material when I look off axis. I find that unlikely at 5-10<U+00B0> off axis, plus it clears up after a narrow distortion. The next to last time I went in, they asked me to go more than a couple days and try a full two weeks as my eyes needed more time to adjust (I've never taken more than a day or so to adjust in the past, but I'm getting older, so maybe). They have checked the as-made prescription, my old glasses (prescription matches), and reverified my measurements against the as-built. On my final visit (after a full two weeks of dealing with this annoying blurriness), I went in to the doctor instead of the optician. She verified my prescription and suggested that maybe the coating is causing an issue or a material change could be causing the difference. I brought my old glasses back in and they saw that they were polycarbonate (my new lenses are Trivex). The optician told me that I just need to wait longer to adjust. I'm at 2.5 weeks of wearing them all the time. I feel like the office has just written me off - they already lost money on remaking the lenses a couple times. I don't know what to do. If it was just the vertical distortion, I could probably learn to try and ignore it. I feel like my options are: 1) Accept them as is and hope more weeks of waiting pay off 2) Return them and go back to old glasses until the fully disintegrate 3) Take current glasses to another optometrist and see if they have a better solution/idea of what is happening 4) Return the glasses, go somewhere else, hope that I don't have the same issue I've been wearing glasses for some 30 years now and the only thing I've had like this was a prescription made wrong in one eye which was quickly corrected and worked great.

I've always struggled with mental health and have been diagnosed with depression since I was younger, but I never experienced anxiety before. Since the surgery though I've been getting anxiety attacks and extreme feelings of anxiety all the time and it's uncontrollable and nothing I've ever experienced before.

Not like intrusive thoughts, voices that will say one or two words at a time completely unrecognisable and they feel like they're echoing in my skull.

I have this since childhood and it was never an issue. Will it *be* an issue during the retinopexy? Should I mention it before the procedure? I don't get it often but it can get especially bad with anxiety (my professors at university used to give me more than a weird glance during oral exams as I couldn't just get my eyes to keep still). What if I move and the laser ends up burning a tiny spot where it shouldn't? Is it possible to take short pauses between the flashes to look at other objects for a few seconds?

11058,"Hi, all. I am looking for advice on what specifically to request in my glasses lenses from the optician at my eye doctor's office (independent practice, not a chain or online) and advice on the frame itself. If it matters, I have worn contacts for the last 25+ years and will be getting an updated prescription on those as well. My glasses prescription is around a -13.00 in both eyes. I'm nearing 40 and my prescription is stable, so I'm willing to pay more for thinner lenses, but aside from requesting the high index 1.74, I have no idea what other things to mention or ask of the optician. I have looked online quite a bit, but have become overwhelmed and confused with all the terminology and contradicting articles. Regarding the frame itself, I am currently wearing a frame size 49-17-135. The lens height is around 28. My face is a bit round, so to offset that I have chosen a rectangular shape frame in the past, but realize now this is contributing to the thickness of my lenses. Also, when I smile, my cheeks tend to touch (due to roundness) the bottom of frames with a taller lens height, which the shorter lens of the rectangular frame also prevents. If I were to opt for an oval lens, would the lenses be substantially thicker than if I were to get a round lens? Any advice or insight you could provide so that I may be better informed prior to my appointment would be very helpful. I will certainly be asking for the opinion of the optician, but, while I have great faith in my opthalmologist, I'm not as confident in the optician's knowledge or desire to help. Thank you! ",0

I still see all the light refraction errors/bleeding/smearing with my glasses on. My main question is - If my glasses don't do anything to fix my right eye's vision, even though my optometrist prescribed them with ""astigmatism"" in mind, is that a sign that I should be concerned about an underlying problem which is NOT astigmatism? Also, as far as dry eyes go, if this was to impair my vision, wouldn't it at least fluctuate throughout the day? My vision is the same at the start of the day as it is by the end of the day. Morning or night. Sleep or no sleep. Work or no work. Eye drops or no eye drops. Glasses or no glasses. The vision issues that sparked my original concerns stay the same.

An IOP of 22 is not necessarily high, especially in a young person and even more so if the pressure was taken with NCT (the air puff test) since that is less accurate and more likely to run high than applanation.

11064,"Hello everybody. I can't sleep. Recently I've noticed that my vision is very impaired. I've used glasses all my life (I'm 38), so I went to get some new ones, but that same day I noticed something: my vision wasn't really blurry, it was impaired because I'm seeing a circle shaped layer in the middle of my left eye's field of vision. Kind of feels like a shadow of my pupil was projected from the back. Not saying it's my pupil, but the scale of the circle reminds of it. I made an image: [\[eye. png\](](https://postimg.cc/34rcmYBg/aa68a430)[https://postimg.cc/34rcmYBg](https://postimg.cc/34rcmYBg)[)](https://postimg.cc/34rcmYBg/aa68a430) The circle doesn't hide the image, but it feels like a layer of Photoshop with opacity turned slightly up, so the brightness on my left eye is lower. Can't really tell if my entire field of vision is less bright, but for sure within the radius of that circle. I don't really notice the shape until trying to look at it, but the lack of brightness is 24/7. If I cover my right eye and blink my left one quickly, I can see the circle perfectly, but kind of like when you look at a light for some time and you still see it afterwards.. Just like that, but then it fades way while my eye is completely shut. I feel this either started happening recently, or I just noticed the circle. I'm guessing my brain is trying to focus on that circle and real world objects, so it's difficult reading or writing. Not impossible, I'm doing it right now... By the way, I also see floaters, for months. First on my right eye which is okay, I've learned to live with them, then a few of them on my left eye. Also lived with them. But this circle. Not comfortable. I'm going to a specialist asap, but everything is closed until Tuesday where I am. I'm terrified. Am I too paranoid? I'm afraid of losing my vision.

I went to an eye surgeon who said I'm not an ideal candidate for lasik since my cornea is slightly thinner than average. I could probably manage one lasik procedure but no enhancements. On that note I also have dry eyes and was not looking for lasik. I had heard about ICL and the surgeon said I am a candidate for that, but she doesn't do it and referred me to another clinic. I haven't had my consult with that doctor yet, but I am not confident my vision can be completely corrected. The surgeon did mention stacking the two procedures, but I'm scared of the dry eyes and not being able to get enhancements. But could I change the ICL for the enhancements as my vision changes?

KC does NOT mean the end of your eyesight or your world. You are now embarking on a journey, a KC journey. I was diagnosed in 1968 and 1970 when there was no such thing as CXL, Sclerals and transplant procedures were primitive. I had successful transplants (1980, 1982) and I am now in glasses 20/25 and 20/40.. My advice to you is: 1. Not panic 2. Find a doctor and lens fitter that you trust. It's YOUR eyesight. Get a 2nd opinion if you need it. 3. Follow his/her instructions 4. If you have ANY problems or concerns, contact them. Even when it is after clinic hours, there is always someone on call to help. Yes, you have support online, something I didn't have in my day; however, run everything you read online by your doctor before any treatment; even advice from me :) There are so many great treatments today. The chances of needing transplants are much slimmer than in my day. You should do fine. Most get relief by CXL and Scleral lenses. I hope this calms your fears a bit :) \*\*\*\*\*Update,\*\*\*\*\*\* July, 2021 Saw my doctor on the 26th.. 39 and 41-year-old grafts are still clear and healthy.

11077,"Doctors don't take a PD as part of a standard exam because it has nothing to do with your health or prescription. Opticians take a PD measurement when preparing to dispense glasses, if you've bought glasses from your previous optician they will have a record of everything about those glasses in your medical chart for 7 to 30 years by law in most states and provinces in North America and the UK. If you didn't buy glasses from that optician, they wouldn't record any measurements they had taken and given to you on a piece of paper. The reason that we don't hand out PDs is because when people use them to buy glasses online and the glasses end up being garbage quality, the first thing Zenni/etc does is tell them their PD was measured incorrectly (it wasn't), which sends hundreds of people a year back to us to do free customer service and troubleshooting for their shitty companies. The first few times, it's a fun learning experience for staff who are in school. The next few hundred, we get a little jaded about it. ",0
11078,"I am 24F. I have had a squint and lazy eye since I was a child, it was never severe enough for surgery and has gotten better since then. I was patched as a child but had to stop due to fears of causing double vision. I have been suffering with binocular diagonal diplopia for almost 2 years. It is mainly when looking at lights or screens or reading things up close. It also varies constantly throughout the day and is definitely happening much more than when it first started. I have tried several fresnel prisms with limited success due to the variable nature of the double vision. I am currently using a 5 diopter prism at a slight angle to try and correct it. It works some of the time but not for all of the day. Basically I've run out of options. My squint is so small I cannot have surgery, prisms are not working all the time but stronger prisms make me feel ill and over correct when looking at distance. I am 24 years old and it feels like I might have to deal with this for the rest of my life so I wanted to see if there was any other ideas? ",1

11081,"I was diagnosed at 35 last year, after suspecting it for many years (My Dad has it and had a transplant many years ago) though my then Opto kept denying the possibility. I also got CXL done last year as it had progressed from barely there to 'Get it NOW' in 8 months. My whole life I have been sensitive to light, and have had halos since I can't remember, ghosting too. Oh the dim light! I hate it so much. I may as well be blind as a bat. ",1

I developed a few more later on and was told to get tested for it. I didn't because I just didn't want the finality of it (and also not wanting to do the traditional dance with doctors going back and forth) but I have since had a lot more problems that seem to all point back to being symptoms. I did not know that palpitations, dizziness, and fatigue were symptoms too. I don't have cavities but I do have a lot of cracked teeth (my dentist said this was normal wear and tear), a dry non-Covid cough that I just have all the time, bowel issues, arthritic symptoms, cold chills/shivers (?) and a few others. I guess my next question is: Is it really manageable? I have another condition (unrelated) that also cannot be cured and the idea of tagging one more on there is just emotionally draining. I don't think I have the energy to go through the motions all over again and unlike with that, I am not in ""pain-pain"". It's more like passing spells that come and go. ",0

When my optometrist used his ophthalmoscope, he only looked into my left eye and said ""I'm not even going to bother looking at the right, the specialist can deal with that""<U+009D> He referred me to a specialist, but my mind jumped to the worst scenario. I've looked on different eye-related websites and I'm worried the dark areas might be choroidal melanoma. I'll try to attach a picture. Any thoughts? Thanks! ",0
11085,"Hi, 25 year old here, noticed my keratoconus at age 16, but was not properly diagnosed until I was 21. I currently wear scleral lens contacts (the brand is zenlens) and they are comfortable enough to wear all day. My right eye, which is the one with the more advanced keratoconus, is 20/200. Which means I have to be 20 feet away to see something people with normal vision can see at 200 feet. This is also the legal threshold for blindness in the US. Despite being 20/200, with contacts my right eye can get to 20/20. So I'm able to function normally and live my life just fine. Trying to drive without contacts though is very scary. You can have CXL done to slow or stop the advancement, but I've never had that done. But yeah. Basically, there are contact types out there that are likely an option for you to see clearly. Keratoconus sucks but it's a condition with workarounds thankfully. ",1

11088,Your kmax is low just get the CXL only and follow your doctor advice. Your in similar position to me but mine is a lot worse. Since PRK needs around 50 microns it's best to do it above 500 since your below that's why advised CXL only. After CXL my kmax went down by 2D so expect a reduction of 1-2D from 50 and 55. Your situation is good. You can get improvements it's good your acting early on the CXL. Are you doing both eyes or the bad eye? I haven't had my good eye done am 25 and monitoring for progression. Also there are many procedures on the horizon such as CTAK (which adds cornea thickness) IVmed drops which will aim to flatten cornea and other laser advancements. In our lifetime it's likely they will fix this by stem cell research so support that as much as you can lol. ,1
11089,"I work at specsavers (lab tech). I can't say much about the probable lens thickness, as in order to calculate it I'd need the PDs from your prescription. Then I could know the approximate thickness at the edges. The dispensing optician should have taken these measurements, and if you ever want to find out you can call them and ask for it, they are required by law to provide you this information per request in the EU. I have trouble understanding how such thin metal glasses would actually help with the lenses not appearing thick To answer your question here, a thicker plastic frame could potentially mask the lens thickness, but the actual lens inside would still be just as thick. But the second frame you got recommended will actually have thinner lenses despite also being a thin metal rim frame. Let me explain: lenses for myopic (shortsighted) people are thinnest at the centre, and as you go outwards toward the edges, they get thicker. [This image](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-00394cfa19142757fad61c60373b9800) illustrates what I mean quite well. By suggesting a smaller diameter frame (which the second one is), you basically guarantee that the lenses will be cut out into a smaller shape, meaning thinner at the edges. So yes, the second frame is a much better choice for you. To sum up, there isn't a lot you can do besides going for an even smaller frame, which I undestand if you don't want to do, or going for 1.74, which is quite a lot more expensive than a 1.67. Another option is to look at some frames sold elsewhere, perhaps online. You might find some acetate frames with nosepads that might suit you, and Specsavers (at least here in the UK) offer a service where you bring in your own frame for them to put new lenses in. Hope that helps! ",0
11090,"So here's the basic story: I'm 31M, have KC. Have been feeling very anxious lately about losing my sight, tbh. My left eye has KC but with glasses it is fine. I get close enough to 20/20, and I only notice minor weird things like higher-order aberrations in my left eye. My right eye is totally useless. I've tried every kind of lens, including RGPs and sclerals. I have one main question: now that I pretty much depend on my left eye to do my job, and since I haven't seen any progression in it, is it advisable to get CXL? My doctor said that it was my choice, that it could progress rapidly, or it could just stay like this forever, but that it was hard to say. My big worry is that my right eye is not corrected well. I've tried a lot of combinations of lenses in that eye, but no matter what, the astigmatism is just too intense to really use it. I've tried SynergEyes, soft lenses, RGPs, and one kind of advanced lens design. I feel bad, because a lot of quite-good lens fitters have fitted the eye and the best I can get is ""good enough"" vision in full light (still lots of HOAs). One of my fitters said there might be an underlying lens problem in my right eye and that I may never be able to expect truly ""good"" vision from the eye. So in light of this, I have a few questions: * My left eye isn't noticably progressing. The amount of HO loss in that eye is fairly minimal, and regular astigmatism is correctable with just glasses. Is it possible that CXL will induce astigmatism that can't be corrected with glasses? What are the rough chances that that will end up happening? * Glasses leave right eye uncorrected, but it can't really be truly corrected with sclerals/GPs either. As in, I can't use a computer monitor with my right eye even with a variety of lenses. * Is it worth considering intacs in the right eye? PRK? The is basically useless at this point.. I realize you all likely can't give a solid answer, but would be happy for any insight I can get. ",1

11102,"Hello there... I'll be honest, if she is having difficulty seeing at night regardless of ability, then it's best not to drive at all. I've had keratoconus for over 20 years, and if I was to even attempt to drive at night, it would be dangerous not just for me, but anyone else and objects around. I just try to live life without driving at night (or day now). [example of what I see at night](https://twitter.com/marshallholland/status/1446330518241378304?s=21) For me, it's not about confidence or learning how to get around it, it's the inability to see well, period, and finding ways to work around is challenging. My life has been driven by my keratoconus (I just had to accept that), and I have to make choices that accommodate my vision as best as I can. When I was younger, people would pressure me into things, like driving, and they didn't understand my eye disease, they were trying to help, I'm sure, but they couldn't grasp the fact that it's just that my vision is poor and no ""learning"" to drive at night isn't going to help any... I'll emphasize this, if she cannot see well at night, don't even force her, it's safer for her and anyone else on the road. I hope you don't feel like I'm attacking... But this is a subjective I feel really passionate about as I lived with it for so long. It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's like telling someone in a wheelchair that they just need to learn how to stand up more--I know, bad example, but sometimes that's how I feel with people pressuring me about my eyes. So if she doesn't feel comfortable with her vision, then it might be best to find alternatives, maybe her job could provide reasonable accommodations in order for her to do her job fully. Best of luck to her, and yourself. Life doesn't stop with keratoconus, it just gets more interesting as we have to find different life paths to take, ones that no one else can see. ",0

In April 2020 I had my first baby. Throughout the pregnancy I was diabetic (gestational) and insulin controlled. Before the pregnancy I was borderline diabetic. After my son was born, 2 months later I got pregnant again. This landed me with gestational diabetes again. So technically I've been pregnant and diabetic for 2 years now. Insulin controlled. I was borderline for years before but I'm not sure 'how' borderline. Admittedly my blood sugars have been very poor in both pregnancies. Leading me to be induced at 36 weeks with my first son. I am scheduled for induction at 37 weeks with this baby, which is in 3 weeks time. I'm 34 weeks pregnant. Anyway, yesterday I woke up from a nap and noticed when I was reading on my phone I appeared to have a tiny blind spot in my right eye that was making parts of letters 'go missing' in the texts I was reading. I shrugged it off. I get migraines a lot. However, after 24 hours the missing piece in my vision was still not back. I can't see anything when closing my eyes. No flashing and nothing like that.

I have MGD/blepharitis. I did the warm compress thing for a while but I felt like it was making my eyes drier. I wash my eyelids with dilute baby shampoo twice a day and that has been very helpful. Anti-inflammatory diet plus eyelid hygiene has sent my Schirmer numbers back to normal. Ophthalm. says he would not diagnose me with blepharitis now. My eyes feel dry sometimes, especially in AM. I use Systane gel drops at night; you could try that, also a bedside humidifier. Look, it sounds like you are really on top of things. I hope you don't have Sjogren's (I HATE having this illness!), but if you do you will find a lot of support here. If you want my gut feeling, though: I don't think you have it. Maybe MGD plus anxiety. My suggestion: drink lots of water every day, go on an anti-inflammatory diet, do the eyelid hygiene, get some relaxation/self-hypnosis audios, work on improving your sleep (all the usual suggestions plus maybe a relaxing book to read in bed, consider Paul McKenna's I Can Make You Sleep self-hypnosis program--it's helped a lot of friends of mine). Find that good functional medicine doc and keep paying attention. Keep us posted! (Small commercial for the anti-inflammatory diet: my new rheum said, ""I don't like to use the word perfect, but your numbers are perfect--it's almost like you don't have an autoimmune disease."" She meant the non-Sjogren's numbers--I'm still ANA, SSA, and SSB positive, with one number off the charts. But even my rosacea has dropped from 4 with medication to 2 w/o meds on a 10-pt scale.

It seems to be failing fast, she's gone from not having glasses two years ago to having a strong prescription, then an eye test a year later which needed a much stronger prescription again.

I am 31 years old and I have always been healthy. Within the last few months I've noticed that I started having a tremor in my right hand, a lot of weakness in my hand and A LOT of pain in my feet. I have a hard time walking when I wake up in the morning or when I've been sitting for awhile. The best way I can describe it is that the bones ache. I have been clumsy and dropping things a lot. I've also been having issues with my vision - but really couldn't pinpoint what the issue was. Sometimes I feel like I'm looking through water and my depth perception is off. I do have 3 kids under the age of 5 but I am beyond exhausted. I sleep great at night but I just wake up so so tired. I got my family doctor involved about 6 weeks ago. She did an examination and ran a huge panel of blood work. She also referred me to a neurologist. All of my blood work has come back normal. I went to the eye dr as well and explained what was going on and she didn't see anything concerning but didn't like my symptoms. She agreed with the neurologist referral. I saw the neurologist about a month ago. It was a very long appointment with a physical exam and history. He ended the appointment explaining that he thinks I have an issue with my peripheral nervous system. The initial concern with my eye dr and family dr was possibly MS. The neurologist said he didn't think so. He ordered an EMG (still waiting) and an MRI (scheduled for Oct 2). The neurologist believed my optic nerve looked okay and didn't think there was any optic neuritis. FFWD to last week. My husband and I were watching a hockey game and I took my glasses off to look at my phone. I looked up and realized that I could actually read the score. My vision is -3.50 in both eyes and I can basically just see blurred color without my glasses on. I then realized that only my right eye could see well. My left was still the same. I booked in to see my eye dr again the next day. She was immediately concerned. She did a pressure test and read that my right eye was now a 0.0. It had fully improved to 20/20 vision. She did some scans and showed me that my macula looked very strange and that it Appeared to be wrinkled. She said I needed to be seen by an ophthalmologist. She told me that typically what causes the macula to wrinkle is from pressure behind the eye. This is also what causes the improved vision as it shortens the lens of the eye. She told me her concern was that there may be a tumor behind my eye. Cue freaking out. The next day I was seen by an ophthalmologist at the hospital. He did a ton of tests and scans and agreed with my optometrists concerns. He saw the wrinkling on my macula and sent me straight for a CT. He told me his concern was also a tumor. 2 hours later I was back in his office and he gave me the news that the CT was clear. No tumor. He said he was extremely surprised as he was quite convinced it was a tumor. He then told me I needed to be seen by a retina specialist as he believed the blood vessels behind my eye were swollen and had no idea on the reason. Again, the next day, I saw the retina specialist. He must have spent 30 minutes looking at my eye at a ton of different angles. He said ""wow this is an interesting one for a Saturday morning!""<U+009D> He thought maybe my optic nerve was a bit swollen but not very much. He also agreed that I had coroidal folds on my macula and had absolutely no idea why. He is a renowned doctor and said he's very stumped by my case and said he will dig deep to find answers. He said he believes there is sort of rate condition or disease causing this. He said the vision shift from a -3.50 to a 0 is extremely concerning and that we absolutely need to find the cause. On Monday I have a ton more scans at his office, an ultrasound and a Fluorescein angiography. He's going to be working with my neurologist to see if they can figure out what's going on. I feel scared and also just really tired. I want to know what's going on and no one seems to have a clue. If you made it this far - I appreciate your thoughts and time! Here's to a diagnosis sometime soonish! ",1

11114,"It's possible you were having issues getting the best prescription because your eyes have been dry. Dryness will alter the surface of your eye. This can cause fluctuating astigmatism values or inaccurate measurements from the machines or whoever is doing the refraction (optometrist most likely). Regardless of what you choose to do, is recommend treating the dry eye aggressively to see if this helps your overall situation. Use an artificial tear 4 times a day in both eyes (breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime). Use the drop even if you don't feel you need it. If you use the tears more than 4-6 times a day, switch to a preservative free variety. Also, don't use anything with a redness reducer. So avoid visine, clear eyes, ophcon, naphcon, and lumify. I'd suggest a brand like refresh, blink, Systane, liquitears, Genteal, or theratears. There are a bunch of brands but you can use any, even the cheapest is a good place to start. In addition, do a hot compress once a day for 5 minutes (heat a washcloth under hot water and rest it on the closed eyes). Once the 5 minutes are over, take the heat off the eyelids and gently massage the eyelids with your fingers. This will also help improve the quality of your tears. Furthermore, if you work on screens often or read a lot or do focused near work (knitting, puzzles, crosswords, painting...), this is contributing to your dry eye surface. Follow what's called the 20/20/20 rule. Every 20 minutes is focused work/tv/computer..., take a 20 second break where you look up from what you're doing and look 2 feet away. It will help remind you to blink and reduce strain. You should also put an extra eye drop in before doing your focused activity to help keep the surface lubricated. Another important thing to know is your age. If you're under 16, your glasses are much more important for the health of your eyes and you need the most accurate prescription. If you're older than that, wearing any glasses won't hurt your eyes. But if you're wearing the wrong prescription, things will be blurry and you're more likely to get eye strain and headaches while using the glasses. Just because you are given a prescription for glasses doesn't mean you have to get it. If you're concerned the prescription isn't great, get another opinion and a new refraction (preferably after treating your dry eyes for at least 2-4 weeks). You'll be glad it only cost you a glasses exam fee instead of having to buy two pairs of glasses (which can get quite costly). ",0
11115," I spend the day thinking about how horribly dry I am, nothing I do improves, I can hardly sleep and I can't stop thinking about the future. I'm starting to fear that I can't take it and I don't know what to do. Have you been through this? I don't know how you live day by day with this, my mouth is killing me and I know that these are only the initial symptoms. is this because of anxiety and fear? When you get used to the disease, can you take it ""normally""? I am afraid that the little saliva I have will disappear and I will have nothing left or that my eyes will dry out even more. I am also afraid that it could be something more serious, like amidoilosis, I saw that it can dry your mouth and eyes, and make your tongue with teeth marks on the edges, which I have. There are times when I think, uh, it's just dry, you shouldn't be like that because of that, but it's horrible I can't handle it. My mood changes constantly between hating everything, being sad and scared, I'm angry, because I have to suffer this, I'm 24 years old, why I couldn't have it when I'm 60, why I have to live like this all my life I've started to think about what will happen if I can't stand it, I'm afraid of not wanting to live in the future. I can't get distracted, when I wake up after about 3 hours I can't go back to sleep and I spend hours thinking about it.

11117,"I (36 F) have been having wonky periods for at least 7-8 years now. Basically my cycle is extremely long - usually 45-50+ days, and recently I have been skipping every other month. (By cycle, I mean the entire cycle including ovulation - not my actual period which usually lasts 3-4 days). I know it used to be weird from over exercising and not eating enough. I am \*extremely\* careful about that now, but I took a hormone test (the DUTCH test) last spring, and it said my cortisol was super high all day long. I think Sjogrens is maybe the source of the increased cortisol/inflammation in my body, cuz I sleep a good amount, eat healthy, don't have a stressful life, etc. I'm a HUGE nerd about nutrition, supplements, and holistic health, and I have read extensively about hormones and know that they are involved in pretty much every system of the body. There's a direct correlation between inflammation caused by disease (or from diet, outside factors, etc) and it messing up your brain's signaling to your ovaries telling them it's safe to ovulate. Has anybody else figured out a connection between Sjogrens/other AI and weird periods, and if so, did getting it treated fix anything? Have your hormones balanced since managing your AI symptoms?

11119,"Actually, all kind of ring segments, it's just flattens the cone, stretch it and make it steeper, the visual improvement is just short term, according to Dr. Kanellopoulos who was one of the Dr's who invented the ICRS there were too many issues and complications after longer time of period. The laser based method is much more accurate and with better results according to him also, that's why this kind of procedure was abandoned after a while, it is still used in some regions in Europe and in the world (mostly in India). It must have a good reason why specialized eye doctors don't recommend this surgery or taken out of their list. Like I said, I've asked them also if ICRS would be an option for me and they said, they don't recommend it because the Laser surgery is much more effective and much more efficient. I would strongly reconsider this ICRS surgery if I were you and if possible talk to another specialized eye doctor about different methods or Google it. Also look up for Dr. Kanellopoulos, he is one of the main specialist for Keratoconus in the world, his studies, researches and techniques are used all over the world. He is doing now the Athens Protocol which is the best solution for Keratoconus at the moment, he is doing this procedure for now 15 years with outstanding results and also I was treated with this procedure in December 2020.

My primary motivation for getting my eye exam was due to fact that I am getting a lot of eye fatigue (extremely dry, tiredness) and that it's been three years since I've had one; does the fact that I didn't notice significant improvements out of the new prescription indicate that I probably won't be able to get much better vision from corrections by lens?

It does make it feel better and after an especially worse morning, I noticed the next day it looked better. Is baby shampoo an outdated treatment?

11124,"No, it's not. Sorry for the long story, but it's an explanation why. There are many reasons it's not 20/20. I was in very thick glasses by the time I was 3 years old. When I was 15, very much against my parent's wishes, I got hard contact lenses. They opened up a new world for me. When I was 28, I had a staph infection in my right eye for six months and when the final eye patch came off - I was totally blind in that eye. Four cornea specialists later, I was finally diagnosed with KC. I had a cornea transplant the following day and it has lasted me 41 years. The life expectancy of a transplant is 10-15 years so I've been lucky. Both eyes developed cataracts when I was 45 years old, but I had surgery on both a month later and it was a breeze. I've had quite a few procedures through the years due to severe abrasions on my cornea. Very few people wear contact lenses from age 15 to age 70 (now) without issues, but it's never been a choice for me. Now, my vision is about 20/80 and I wear readers most of the time to get to 20/40. I'm thrilled with the vision I have now and the comfort of the slerals. ",0

I've had this pigment noted since I was about 13 and was sent to an ophthalmologist who did a slit lamp with dilation and said it was just normal pigmentation you were born with it and that it's more common in people with blue eyes. My Mum has the same and shes had it checked a couple times. It's always mentioned at my eye exams and once I say it's been investigated they leave it alone. The pigment is the same in both eyes and its very far over, it cant be seen under a microscope unless they really angle the little attachment they use and I have to look as far over as I can. The fundus pictures cant detect it. I've got myself in a bit of a state over this because this optician seemed fascinated by it. He was describing it to me as a bit like a dried dessert with brown and blue pigment. Hes asked me to come back in 12 months time just to check it again, out of his fascination he said. I asked if I needed to be concerned and he didnt believe so due to the fact if I've had this since birth and it's still only that far into the corners that it's difficult to see. I had a OCT scan and perphial test and he said all looks fine. Although he did comment the Oct scan marked my eyesight as slightly worse than my physical eye test? My eye prescription is -0.50 in right eye -0.25 in left with very mild astigmatism in both. I do experience mild starbursting around led lights. I dont believe i'm experiencing reduction in my night vision, can see furniture in the dark and stars at night etc. I was going to book in again to get another opinion but now I'm too afraid theyll say it is RP.

11130,but aren't necessary for commercially available soft contact lenses. Necessary is a trash argument. It's a medically necessary device. Clearly accurate measurements are necessary and there are different lenses that offer different diameters and base curves for lenses. So then what about a corneal topographer or keratometer? I get what your trying to say that due to soft lenses being well soft an exact fit doesn't sound necessary. But can you prove that to me? There isn't really alot of trust on my end here from dealing with doctors who don't want to release prescriptions to dealing with doctors who don't think abbe values are necessary I have little trust when I hear someone say they don't think it's necessary. It isn't necessary for a car to go 60 mph but you wouldn't want a car salesman trying to say that it wasn't necessary as an argument for why you would want a car that can drive on all roads. Like I said I don't want it covering my sclera. And clearly you have tools to measure the exact fit of them for rigid lenses. So what can I ask to determine who has the best tools to get the most accurate measurements. If the diameter of the lens is not the reason it was covering my sclera what was? ,0

At three months, he said we were just gonna keep tabs on the left eye and see how it continues to act.

I also paid extra for the pictures (of my retina I believe?) He said it was probably a large floater that will eventually dislodge and dissolve? The shadow/curtain has since moved further down to just above my direct line of sight, and now in the middle top instead of the top right corner. Sometimes the shadow will pulse/flicker.

11139,"I'm 33 and have been a -2.0 in both of my eyes for the past 3 years or so. I'm currently fitted with Air Optix (plain version with Hydraglyde). I had this year's annual exam recently, and the doctor mentioned that eyes had slightly changed (without elaboration at that time), and I was placed in the same prescription. Following that comment, I started hyper focusing on pretty much anything and everything, and realized that a **ton** of text in the world around me was slightly out of focus. I can see fine and large objects are in focus, but text on my phone, computer, signs that are more than 40 feet away or so... everything is just ever so slightly ""off"". On screens, it's enough to cause this glowy effect even though I can perfectly read the text. I've gone back for re-fitting twice and my doctor has tried putting me in several different contacts to try and see some difference, but we fall flat each time: * Air Optix for Astigmatism, same strength of -2.0. No change. (Doctor said I have slight astigmatism, but not near the threshold for needing correction. This contact didn't really fix it, so hopefully that is not my issue. Besides, toric lenses did *not* agree with me, pretty uncomfortable.) * Air Optix Night & Day, -2.0 in on eye and -2.25 in another eye. No change. * Air Optix (same plain version), increased strength to -2.25 in both eye. Better, but still out of focus. (I printed a home Snellen chart and the bottom 20/20 line is still somewhat illegible. D/P, and E/F look the same) A little head pressure around my temples occurs that I haven't had in days prior. Not painful, but noticeable, and seems to be lessening after day 2. With -2.0 or -2.25 in each eye, I can **always** slightly apply pressure to the top corner of my eyelid to force either eyeball to focus differently and give me what I would call ""perfect"" vision"". Any suggestions of what I should discuss with my doctor on my next visit & try at getting a perfect prescription? Part of me wishes I had kept living in habituated bliss, but now I can't unsee it all. My fear is that I have to live with out-of-focus text and go back to my original prescription, or use a stronger prescription that might cause headaches. ",1
11140,"First, I am not a doctor. Second, I have not done CXL because I was way too old to need it by the time it became available. Third, whatever I know about CXL comes from reading, a lot of it in this subreddit. The accelerated procedures use stronger UV lights as far as I know. I have not heard of any difference in the pain. What I have read is that the procedure itself is essentially painless because of the anesthetics that are used. The recovery ranges from uncomfortable to painful but that seems to be mostly for the day or two following and dependent on the individual. Some have even reported one eye being painful and the other not. Removal of the epithelium, saturating the cornea with riboflavin, and exposure to strong UV light are all going to irritate the cornea. Probably like skinning your knuckle and getting a sunburn combined. So it is not surprising that it takes a bit of time to get over that. But this is way better than recovering from a corneal transplant or even dealing with 20 years of anxiety about whether your KC is going to progress and require another contact lens fitting. ",0

11147,"I've noticed an uptick in new users that have been diagnosed and thought I'd share a bit of my story and an update. To start I was diagnosed last year at the age of 24. It started around the time I had a sinus infection and my eyes get really irritated and watery so I was rubbing them all week. I was driving home one night and noticed some double vision in my left eye. I go see my optometrist and she suggests I see a neurologist. I wanted a second opinion so I went and saw an ophthalmologist. After being seen 3 times by 2 different doctors I was diagnosed with keratoconus. I was given a pamphlet with information, told to look into sclerals, and was sent on my way. Fast forward 2 months and $1600 later I have sclerals. I hated them and couldnt even get them in right. So I just used my glasses for the most part. My right eye still had 20/20 with glasses at this point. That didnt last very long. About 3 months later around July I start noticing double vision in my right eye as well, although a lot less severe. It was pretty clear it was getting worse fast. So here I go to new doctor that specializes in crosslinking. I get all the tests done and find out I'm a great candidate due to the cornea still being about 495 microns thick. They give me pricing information and even set a tentative date. It felt like I was being sold on it without much info. Here is a disclaimer. Do not trust the internet and strangers on everything. Instead use it as a tool. Thats what I did when I started looking into going to Canada for CXL + PRK. I was not happy with how the doctors treated me and my situation here in Texas. It felt like I was just another patient who didn't matter. I called around to the major clinics that did this, lasik MD, PLEC, etc. I finally decided on PLEC after doing a lot of research. The Dr. There had not only good reviews but the experience and knowledge to do it. Every other individual doctor I looked into was far less experienced from what research I did. So off I go and set up the appointment to get this done. All I had to do was send in my scans and they confirmed I was a candidate. I fly there on a Monday for the initial consultation and some more scans. Tuesday one last test. I got to see Vancouver which is absolutely beautiful. Wednesday my wife flew in and I had the procedure done. The next day I went back for a check up and Friday we flew out. I wont go into detail about the pain and irritation of the first day. There are enough posts about that. The first 2 weeks are very rough and I recommend you take them off from work or school. After that it starts to get better. So here we are. 6 months later and my dominant right eye is sitting at 20/15 vision. Its never been better and it's pretty much stabilized. My left eye which was much worse is sitting somewhere around 20/40 or 20/50. They are putting me back on some prescription drops to see if the left Eye improves a bit. Overall the experience of the surgery is something I hope never to repeat. The pain and light sensitivity are pretty damn bad. The blurriness is horrible. The money spent is quite a lot at least for me. I would do it all over in a heartbeat though. I have better vision now than before with no current signs of progression. I dont have anxiety over possibly not being able to drive. The doctor and entire staff at PLEC were and continue to be great. They still check on me and my tests once my optometrist sends them in. Shout out to my optometrist as well she has been great through all of this. I'll continue getting my check ups when necessary and hopefully I wont ever need another round of CXL. To anyone going through this right now. There are options and there is light at the end of the tunnel. My path may not be right for everyone. I suggest you talk to your doctors. Get a second opinion if you feel you need one. Do all the research you can and if you have a good doctor trust what they say. Feel free to ask any questions you might have. ",1
11148,"Well, in 2004 I was diagnosed by one of the top ophthalmologists in the US at an internationally respected eye institute run by a university medical school based on the condition of my corneas and the overall dryness and high inflammation in my body. No one (meaning no other health professional) has ever questioned the diagnosis. I was lucky to see him, it was just before he retired. It was my local ophthalmologist who got me in to see him and my rheumatologist agreed with the dx. I also have sero-negative RA, if that helps. Sorry, that's all the info I have, but my corneas were/are extremely dry and I make very little tears or saliva or any other moisture in my body -- and it wasn't just low tears, he mentioned something about which specific portion of the tears was missing (but I don't remember for sure, I think it was the oily layer???) At that point Restasis, eye soaks and everything else had failed to control the problem. Now I am on ASEDs, which help but -- as we all know -- there is as yet no treatment for the root cause of Sjogren's, only for the symptoms. It is so frustrating trying to get a diagnosis, even now! That is, I am firmly convinced, because health insurance companies run our healthcare ""system"" instead of doctors and are always wanting to limit having to cover conditions. ( I know this as a retired heatlhcare professional.) It took me about 20 years to get sero-negative RA diagnosed, but those were the bad-old-days when it was not believed to exist. I mention this because there are definite cervical issues with RA and you mentioned your neck. I wish you the very best -- keep pushing! Don't give up! Someday we will have a (sure to be very, very expensive) treatment for the root causes of Sjogren's because you can bet those pharmaceutical companies want the profit! TL;DR: Diagnosed based on cornea condition and tear composition at a top medical research eye clinic. ",0
11149,"The ZCB00 is a monofocal IOL that induces 27 microns of negative spherical aberration. So it has wavefront properties designed to offset the 27 microns of positive spherical aberration that older people accumulate on average over a lifetime. So it's not an aspherically neutral monofocal IOL. I have the B&L Akreos in the right eye. I didn't say it was more reliable. I just said that I'm doing fine with it. I'm sure a lot of people have the ZCB00 and love it. I didn't intend to advocate for a particular IOL, or to bash a particular IOL. Instead, my point was to establish that many of these technologies may have unintended, poorly understood side effects, in addition to whatever genuinely positive effect you might get. As such simpler may be safer. My understanding is that surgeons receive most of their experience explanting IOLs from multifocal IOLs. I also think it's important to understand ones own motivations. My experience with people who have compromised vision, including myself, is that we are all susceptible to persuasion because we do deeply wish our vision problems would disappear. Once you have done a certain level of research, understand all the contextual factors in play, you have to go forward on your decision, whatever it is. ",0

My optician bascially told me there's nothing I can do about it so shouldn't worry, which hasn't really reassured me. Is such a change normal?

11153,Hi this is my exsperiance i hope reading it may answer some of your questions. I had a cornea transplant in my left eye in dec 2017 at age 28 I have worn hard contact lenses for 15 years but the cornea became too scard and distorted. I saw a special specialist doctor and went through all the alternatives with me in my case the other options were crosslinking but i was to advanced for that and slerical lenses which did not seem practical to me so i took the graft option. I live in nz so i was lucky enough to get the procedure through the public health system for free. Ill be straight up the first two weeks after the surgery were hell i stayed with my parents to look after me. Even though my other eye wasnt operated on it took its toll on it and i couldn't really see for two weeks. Things got better after another three weeks i began to feel normal again but i took three months off work and then another three months doing part time i was lucky to have a good boss who was really good about it all. Two years later they began removing the sutures a couple at a time and thats when i began to notice the vision improving. That took 18months and takes me too where i am today wearing a lense again in the left eye. As a result of the trauma to the eye from the graft i did develop a cataract which is now distorting my vision and my next path is cataract surgery sometime this year. Summing up eye pain can be an issue at times and can drive you mad but i recommend just sleep it off. Im happy i had the graft as it greatly improved my vision. ,0

I have printed the Snellen test and put it on my wall to check what's going on. Tests were done at 2.8m distance. I was checking my eyes separately. On my new glasses the right lens improves the right eye and left lens makes things blurrier than without glasses and it's really uncomfortable after 15 minutes.

11188,"Hi there, I am 32 and was told I have ME/CFS 2 years ago. However, I believe in my case this is the Sjogren's causing all the fatigue. To complicate everything, I was also diagnosed with Graves disease in August and already had Hashimoto since 2009... Your symptoms could point up to a flare yes. I am currently experiencing one which started 3 weeks ago. The smoke in the air and extra stress were triggers. The best things to do are to rest, take high quality fish oil (for me it works to calm down the inflammation in my lower back but everyone reacts differently to medication so you would want to talk to your rheumatologist first.) The dryness in the mouth and eyes has gradually worsened since 2018. I have seen an ophthalmologist 2 weeks ago who agrees that it looks like Sjogren's, as my tear production is abnormally low and I also have very dry mouth. I have talked to 2 different rheumatologists since May. The first one told me I am tired because I have CFS... The second one doesn't take a stand concerning Sjogren's. He first said it's highly likely as I have moderately elevated ANA antibodies and all my symptoms, but then changed his mind at the next call, only to change his mind again at our last phone call and said :""It could still be Sjogren's."" I know I have Sjogrens and am lucky my new ophtalmologist agreed with me and sent a letter to the rheumatologist. The rheumatologist refuses to give treatment other than Pilocarpine for saliva production. My insurance doesn't cover it so I can't try it as it would cost around $300/month (Canadian dollars). He also said that Plaquenil won't help with the deep fatigue. I have had to quit working since 2018 and I really want to have a better quality of life. I have also read about the potential retinal toxicity of Plaquenil which sounds scary. However, I would love to have the option to try it and see if after 6 months it starts helping with the fatigue.

This makes it really hard to wear contacts because the same thing happens, only I can't take my contacts out every time I want to read. Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening? Is there a name for this? My brother, sister, and dad all have the same thing but me and my sister have it the worst. Edit: some more info: My migraines are pretty severe usually. I sometimes get nauseous and throw up and usually have to lie down for an entire day. If I manage to notice it before it gets bad I can reduce the severity by taking painkillers (acetaminophen) and not focusing on anything within 6 or so feet. My migraines have a sharp pain between/slightly above my eyes. The migraines started around three years ago and have very slowly increased in severity and frequency, although I've gotten better at managing them. It affects my life because I'm a developer and I have to read text on a screen all day. This increases my chances of accidentally getting too close to the screen and getting a migraine. If I get a migraine I can't work because focusing on small stuff like works hurts really bad. ",1
11191,Hello r/optometry! My vision in my eyes are what I could classify as being significantly different. I took a glance at my new prescription over my mother's shoulder and found it quite an interesting one. My right eye is at -2.50D and my left eye is up at -6.50D. I am turning 15 years old this July. I'm planning on getting contacts when I reach High-school. Any other suggestions? ,1

11193,"You're in the right place!! I'm way older than you (41) but there are many young people with KC. Here's my tip, but it may be irrelevant to you, but want to share. I started off with the peroxide/charcoal cleaner (clearcare). I never had a really comfortable eye but it was doable. I only have one affected eye. I switched to the Boston cleaner, no peroxide. Lens just sits in a little pool of slightly gooey fluid. My eye feels so much more comfortable. Good luck! You really aren't alone. I don't know anyone with KC so I only have this sub. ",1
11194,"My obgyn diagnosed me after seeing some bruises on my leg. I was 35. She took and I tested positive for it. After she took the blood she asked if I had dry eyes and skin, I said well this is Colorado. She asked if I had that on the east coast 8 said yes. Fatigue oh my gosh yes constantly tired. What about joint pain. I told her it's so bad I cannot walk sometimes or put in a bra. She asked me if I had told other doctors. I said oh like 10 they all said it was my weight. Lose weight and everything would go away. The other doctors even said my restless arms and legs would go away. Two weeks later blood work confirmed I had it. I cannot take plaqunil. I do not tolerate it at all. I use supplements of cinnamon and turmeric because they are anti inflammatory. I take 10,000 vitamin d a day. I have low d levels, many patients due to the lack of absorption in the intestines. I take biotin and a chewable multi. I take b12 because I am low in that. I cannot be outside when it is warm I get heat stroke. I can even get it inside if I do too much. I don't sweat much at all. A cold is never a cold. It turns into bronchitis and pneumonia very quickly. Because I am allergic to antibiotics I normally take them with 50mg benedryl. This normally goes on for a month. I end up being off work for a week and powering thru the rest. Sjogrens has attacked my lungs, joints, eyes and mouth. Ever tooth has been worked on at least 4 times. I have double vision with glasses. Triple without. I now have 3 other autoimmune diseases besides this one. Normally when you have 1 you get others. I got the others years after Sjogrens. Three separate doctors think I have had this since right after a very severe bout with chicken pox's when I was 4. Mom said I started having those symptoms then and doctors said it was growing pains and blamed me for not brushing my teeth. Do everything you can now to help yourself.

11196,"Hello. One of my friend who is a pilot, had a similar issues in his early 30's. His vision began to deteriorate and he started to see like a KC patient. The doctors led him down the wrong path where he was trying on different contact lenses in order to try to correct the vision. It was later revealed that his natural lens in his eye went bad and it had to be replaced, just like cataract surgery. In his case, the refractive error was being caused by irregular shaped lens, instead of cornea which is the case with KC patients. Topography will not show anything with normal corneas. Can't say exactly what you may have, but I hope that you'll find a solution to your vision issues. Good luck! ",0

I moved back to Arkansas in 1993 Here is my full story: As someone who has won the battle with Keratoconus, I like to answer all of our newly diagnosed people with this message :) -First of all, do not panic. KC does NOT mean the end of your eyesight or your world. You are now embarking on a journey, a KC journey. I was diagnosed in 1968 and 1970 when there was no such thing as CXL, Sclerals and transplant procedures were primitive. I had successful transplants (1980, 1982) and I am now in glasses 20/25 and 20/40.. My advice to you is: 1. Not panic 2. Find a doctor and lens fitter that you trust. It's YOUR eyesight. Get a 2nd opinion if you need it. 3. Follow his/her instructions 4. If you have ANY problems or concerns, contact them. Even when it is after clinic hours, there is always someone on call to help. Yes, you have support online, something I didn't have in my day; however, run everything you read online by your doctor before any treatment; even advice from me :) There are so many great treatments today. The chances of needing transplants are much slimmer than in my day. You should do fine. Most get relief by CXL and Scleral lenses. I hope this calms your fears a bit :) \*\*\*\*\*Update,\*\*\*\*\*\* July, 2021 Saw my doctor on the 26th.. 39 and 41-year-old grafts are still clear and healthy. He is going to put me into scleral lenses. I get fitted on 9-1 and I and hope to get 20/20 once again :( Cornea transplants are NOT supposed to last this long. I am an exception to the rule. Talk to your doctor :) \*\*\*\*Update 11-26-21 Been in Scleral Lenses since September and they are GREAT. I have 20/20 in both eyes. ",0
11200,"A few years ago I began having slight issues with my vision. At first it was just that with certain headlights ( I think the newer LED ones) I would see a duplicate set of headlights underneath it but in blue. It literally looks like they installed a separate set of headlights right under the first but in blue. Initially it was only when I looked out the side of my eyes but has since become an all time thing. Then came the motion blur with anything lit up in a dim room. A remote, my phone, whatever had any glow to it will leave a very slow light trail behind it. Then came motion blur with anything white. Flipping through a book, wiping something with a paper towel etc. Then the colors that shouldn't be there showed up. Usually it's purple ( when looking at an all white spot like a field of snow, or at a red light a purple haze will be under the red glow) but sometimes is blue. Also when I look across anything lit up a flash of light goes the opposite way. If theres a candle for example and I look to the left of it, I will immediately get a flash of light going to the right. I have recently begun seeing random flashes of purple in my peripheral vision. I also have motion blur now with pretty much anything. My own hands ( I'm a brown skinned person so they're not white at all) and anything I move with them. I also now struggle to see white lit things like the captions on television which now also have a blue outline, and the time on my stove. I also struggle with getting my brain ro let go of an image it has seen. A lot of times it's the pattern of the brake lights from the car in front of me , sometimes 10 minutes after I have seen them. I have eye Drs who listen and examine me thoroughly but see nothing wrong with my eyes. In the past year my vision got blurrier and it seems like every thing would be fine if there was just more light. I did get a new prescription and am waiting for the glasses to come in so maybe that will help with the blurriness but it's been odd. Also when I'm looking at my phone what looks like a negative image of what I'm seeing flashes to the side of my screen. And today the sun was high on the right upper section of my vision but I saw a dark spot the same size as it on my left as well. I am 36 years old. I have a family history of macular degeneration and I myself have somewhat controlled diabetes. I get diabetic eye exams yearly. No visual damage is there. I recently tried seeing a new dr who gave me a test to check how things were with my brain since my eyes seem fine. She sat me in front of a screen with a wire on my scalp and had me watch a tv screen of black and white images. She said the results came back as me having "" a delay"" but won't say what that means only that she wants to talk to my neurologist. . This has been several weeks of anxiety and worrying and I still have no answers because she keeps forgetting about me. Of importance , probably, is the fact that I have had 3 MRIs over the years to check for MS because of odd sensations and muscle movements that are otherwise unexplained. All have come back unremarkable, the most recent a few months ago. It was ordered because in December of 2019 I developed nearly non stop twitching in my eyes and the muscles surrounding them. The twitching eventually spread to my cheeks and lips and has calmed down most everywhere now except my eyes, both of which have fluttering anywhere from right below my eyebrows to my under eye area. It's happening nearly continuously although it's only sometimes visible . The only sites I can find about the test I had showing a delay basically said it's a clear indication of MS. While I definitely don't want MS , if that's where this is heading after all these years of "" is it or isn't it"" then I definitely want to know and to get any meds I can to slow progression. But even when I looked into MS visual symptoms nothing I have been going through seems to be mentioned minus the blurred vision which may be age related regression. All this said.. does anyone have any suggestions to what may be going on? I am uncomfortable using my vision as it is but am terrified of it getting worse or losing it. Could this be MS? Something else? Any advice or ideas would be great, google is NOT my friend but is coming up empty handed anyway. ",1
11201,I'm -5.0 myopic in both eyes and I'm now 36. My vision got bad enough to need glasses when I was about 12 and it got steadily worse until I was in my twenties. But then it settled down and my prescription rarely changes much these days. When you've stopped growing your prescription should settle down a bit. I don't believe there's any research which shows that wearing corrective lenses has a BIG impact on future vision. Most people's myopia is down to the shape of the eye rather than usage. Of course when you get older you'll experience changes in your comfortable reading distance but that'll be down to your age and the reduced flexibility of the lens in your eye. But that's a different thing to being short-sighted. So don't worry. With your level of short-sightedness and your age I very much doubt it will get too much worse. ,1

11207,"Hi everyone! I already have a retinal surgeon that I see, I am 33 with an idiopathic CNV in my right eye. No known cause, the only possibility in my mind is that my daughter was found to have a large protein deletion on chromosome 22, and we're waiting for my results, but I will likely be where that originated from. My doctor is incredibly smart and kind, but busy, so I don't have time to ever ask him questions. If the avastin injections worked, and he sees no current fluid and minimal scaring, then why do I have to keep returning to get my eyes dilated on a monthly basis? Why do I still have a warped area in my peripheral vision? The scans look good now, but if I look through a doorway, the right side looks caved inwards He told me I will have to come in for check ups frequently for the rest of my life. He is stern when he says to come in right away if it gets worse, but otherwise is super casual about it all. I guess it feels like we're making a big deal out of nothing, but then other times it seems concerning.

I went from having to get a few teeth extracted to having to get all extracted due to loss of enamel most likely as a complication from this in a relatively short time-frame.

I'm now 29 years old and the eye that had the CXL has not gotten worse since then. It's worth doing and I wish I could've done it on my bad eye aswell but it had progressed so much.

11212,"I just got my eyes checked yesterday and my glasses RX has slightly changed (not surprising, I was seeing great with my last RX still), but oddly, my left eye which has had a Cylinder value of between -0.50 and -0.75 the last two prior exams, is now listed without a cylinder value at all! To my recollection I've never had this happen with my own eye exams. My glasses are being made atm, and I'm obviously going to try them out since the refraction and everything went very smooth and I was happy with my choices through the ""1 or 2"" stuff, but I'm really curious about this because it's new to me. For what it's worth, this is my new prescription: OD |. Sphere: -4.00 |. CYL: -0.50 |. Axis: 175 OS |. Sphere: -4.75 |. CYL: 0.00 |. Axis: 180 PD 60.00/57.00 (I've always oscillated between a 58-60 PD but I'm a little confused on the two numbers) My contacts are just the basic non-spheric Acuvue Oasys lenses with -4.50 in both eyes (originally the right was -4.00 but they were a bit fuzzy so he bumped it up to match the other which happens often with me in contacts - my right eye usually has to be a bit stronger for some reason). My old RX: 68 OD |. Sphere: -4.25 |. Axis: 168 OS |. CYL: -0.75 |. Axis: 178 Again, a really minor change but the CYL being nonexistent on the new one is throwing me off. I will say though, that wearing my new contacts RX now, my left eye is *really* crystal clear and I'm not having the usual ""wait for the lens to readjust"" that I always used to get with both eyes which I understand is due to astigmatism. I still have it with my right though. So is it possible my astigmatism in the left eye improved or just doesn't merit correction this time? ",0
11213,"Hello everyone, I would like to reach to you experts/enthusiasts as I am unable to put a name on my condition. I've been diagnosed with hypermetropia in both eyes, although stronger in my right eye, very early in my life (must have been 1 year old or so) and had strabismus. Wore glasses ever since until I was 13-14 years old, had eye patches to help strenghten my RIGHT eye. I felt unbelievably uncomfortable trying to see and function only with my right eye, the reason is that the vision from that eye is horrible, and frustratingly hard to explain as well. I finally found a way to describe it and I'm hoping for some answers: Imagine how you are staring at the sun for too long and thus getting a blind spot right in the middle of your vision, to me it, usually looks purple afterwards and for some time until it heals. Now, what I see in my right eye could be hundreds or more tiny blindspots making it impossible to read on my phone. Those blindspots don't have a color, instead it looks like I see through them, this isn't a problem if I'm looking at something plain like a pink T-shirt. I believe my brain tries to fill up the empty spaces but fails miserably once I try to read something small enough. Bonus: I did notice that my colors in my right eye seem very slightly less bright, I had to switch from left to right eye at least 10 times to confirm that. I am now 22 years old and I do see, I believe, normally using only my left eye, leaving the right one only to be used for extra vision and reflexes. Well anything that doesn't require much acuity.

11219,"In my early 40s and had cataract surgery earlier this year. I hate my lens choice. I have to wear glasses all the time because I only have 1 eye with decent vision, so they want me to keep it protected with good lenses. I have worn glasses all my life so I was fine with that. They recommended I go for computer vision (basically arms length). It seemed logical, I spend a lot of time on the computer and if I am going to go without glasses, at my computer seemed to be safest. If I had a time machine and could make another choice? I want to be able to see up close without glasses again! My whole life if something was difficult to see I could just move it closer to my face and could see it. Now, I play this game of putting on my reading glasses, then my distance glasses, then no glasses while moving it closer and farther away to find just the right spot. Since my surgery, my advice for everyone has been this... If you have vision now that works without glasses, pick the lens that will replicate that. However, your son is in a unique position of being very young and needing a lens for each eye. I would talk to the surgeon about correcting one eye for distance and the other for near. He could potentially see without glasses. Note, I am most definitely not a doctor and I know nothing about your sons condition but those are some things I would question. ",0

11223,"I've been a uncontrolled diabetic for a few years. I finally bit the bullet and went into the doctor to get it under the control. Initial A1C was 13, now its 9.7 and falling after 2 months. Working on diet and exercise and trending in the right direction. Still have shame for letting it get this far, but I cant change the past. I'm 47M. I went into the optometrist to get a checkup. I had lasik back in 2000, now I have slight nearsightedness and I wear progressive bifocals. No vision complaints, but I went to check it out. Doctor saw some diabetic changes in the eye (non-proliferative), and asked me to see a retinal specialist to monitor. I made an appointment for January. Three days later, I woke up with redness, crustiness and as the morning progressed, \*severe\* pain whenever any light changes. Like a stabbing in my head. I was down for the count. Got in the next day, diagnosed with uveitis and put on steroid drops and a drop to dilate my eyes. Pain went away almost immediately, although my vision continued to be wonky - I assumed because of the dilating drop. Checked in with the Optometrist, and when I complained about the vision he did another retinal scan and noticed changes from just a few days before. I got into the retinal specialist on a priority basis . He said that I have macular edema, which is causing my blurred vision in my left eye. However, he couldnt ascertain if it was diabetic related or related to the uveitis (or if I already had some edema before, and the addition of the uvetitis caused my vision changes). He initially wanted to do a dye study to study the blood flow (not sure exactly what), to apparently help him determine a course of action. When I couldnt do it right then, he put me on on Toradol (generic) drops, and asked to come back in a week. I'm due to go back in a couple of days, which will be 2 weeks from that sudden onset uveitis. Some questions I have (for him, of course, but wondering if anyone wanted to chime in): 1. The sudden onset of it is weird. Is it possible that something in the eye exam unwittingly triggered it? The dilation drops? Or maybe trauma from me rubbing it because of the dilation? 2. I'm going to get worked up for autoimmune disorders next time I see my primary. But from what I understand, if its just the one time it's often idiopathic? 3. Will more time on steroid/nsaids be worth trying before any sort of injectable or other treatment? Frankly, I freaked out (silently) when I got my Lasik and I'm leery of the idea of injectables. (If I have to, I have to, of course). If there's a risk to waiting, though, I'll get what I need to done. 4. What value does the dye study have diagnostically? 5. Is there a chance that the relatively rapid decline in my A1C/sugar levels can cause something like this? I read anecdotally that doing so can cause retinopathy to flareup. If so, whats the likelihood that this will fade with time? Is there a way to determine if this is the case? I appreciate any insight or experience you care to share. Thanks! ",1
11224,"My vision worsened a lot in the last year (almost dropped by 2D sph and 0.5D cyl in both eyes). I can see 20/20 with my glasses though but after checking online and stumbling upon KC, I thought it could be a possible reason and got pretty worried. After getting some advice from this subreddit, I went to a corneal specialist and had my tomography done. He said that I have thin corneas and that so far there are no signs of KC in either of my eyes but I have to be careful about rubbing my eyes too much. Everyone on my dad's side of the family has thin corneas and developed glaucoma after 60 so I wasn't too shocked about my corneal thickness. However, I did rub my eyes a lot when I wore contacts(maybe 5 months) in the last year. Did anyone else experience this? A fast increase in prescription which was corrected by glasses but no result in the scan? Did the eye rubbing I do for 5 months damage my eyes? Does it stop progressing if you stop rubbing your eyes?

I just repeated myself, assuming that she should know what I was talking about. This was her job after all. But she suddenly got very concerned. She took the glasses off me, projected the letter 'F' on the wall, and told me to look thru the machine again. I did. She then asked me, ""How many do you see? I was very confused. I asked her to clarify and she goes. ""How many F's do you see on the wall right now? ""Two.

She then asked me to use my hands to measure how far the images were. Once I did, there was a click and the images got CLOSER. So I moved my hands closer. And closer. And closer and closer. With each click I could literally see my vision getting corrected. 25+ clicks later and my hands clapped together. I started crying. I had never seen a single image before. Sure, I've lived with it long enough to where I don't notice it 90% of the time, but I've never been able to look thru one of those things and see One Picture.

Apparently I need a size 10 prism. I currently have a size 7 (no place nearby sold size 10 plus prescription) but am planning to get my full prescription soon. The point of me typing all of this up was to ask if there was anyone else out there like me? I've never met/talked to someone who has it, let alone has lived with it they're entire life. If you have it, please share! I'd love to talk with you . ",0

I wouldn't worry, your vision might change again for another 5years. I know it sucks because in the end, it's not comfortable and it costs money but if it changes a lot every 3-6month, ask your doctor for a blood check up and your optometrist if there's a way to reduce that and why it's happening.

11233,"Ok, I say this on most posts. From my experience in this sub every body has different experiences and the only way to confirm how it will go for you is ask the specialist (not people on this sub, including me). As I'm sure you've seen from other commenters, recovery time can vary from under a week to 3 months. In America (I think) you can choose between epi-off and epi-on (whether they remove the epidermis or not). Epi-on is less painful in the days after the procedure but recovery can be 3 months and epi-off is very painful for the first 36-48 hours (from my experience) but recovery time (for rough vision) is under a week. In the UK, where I'm from, they only do epi-off as it's recommended by NICE but I don't have any idea on how other countries do it. The time between surgeries was 2 months for me but, like everything else, check with whoever you're seeing for it because you shouldn't just go with what people on the internet say.

I was 26 when I was diagnosed too (am now 28) I worked as a medication aide at an assisted living 4 days a week and basically due to the excessive pain/fatigue/swelling and other symptoms I phased myself out (I am in another department now at the same company). I even got so bad that I took a respite for a month. I literally used the last check I got before taking it to pay off my car (a whole $300) which is the only way I was able to do that. I should probably add that I still live at home. It took me over 15 years for a diagnosis. I too applied for SSDI I was denied twice , did some digging and found a lawyer experienced in winning cases with child disability. I had to go to court but with much prayer and the help of the Lord I was finally approved. Something your girlfriend might think about is asking her doctor to send a list of work accommodations (I believe that is what it is called). That would be things like longer and more frequent breaks, and whatever else she would need to help her do her job. This was one thing they asked me about when I went to court, but I had never asked for anything like that mostly because I never thought about it until I applied for SSDI. Because I basically over the years had phased myself out, like I mentioned before I went from working 4 days a week down to 2, I qualified both for medical and the working part it just took a judge to approve it. I hope some of that is able to help you. I'll be praying for you both! ",0
11240,"I got a eye exam done recently to change my glasses prescription. I had opted for a dilated exam, 3 yrs ago I had got it done and the doc said said my eye pressure was 18 and 20. He wanted to monitor it for glaucoma. He told me get yearly exams but I got lazy. I went in today and he said eye pressure is 18 and 20 and the eye with 20 has a slightly increase optic nerve. He said it usually happens with glaucoma. He drew it on a paper to explain, basically normal eye was o and the 20 eye pressure eye was O. And then he made a much bigger O and said that would be blindness. Anyways he referred me to have some glaucoma test done. Now me being the hypochondriac I am, decided to Google large optic nerve and first thing pops up is papilledema. And the first thing it says is brain tumor. I've already been through my brain tumor phase of anxiety. But now I'm going through it again. Just curious if someone can explain the difference between papilledema and glaucoma.

11243,"I am a 36 yo myopic male with bilateral retinoschisis discovered during a routine eye exam 2 years ago (optos image). It was initially thought to be a retinal detachment by the optometrist, but subsequent exam by an ophthalmologist determined it to be a retinoschisis (with holes). Preventive laser surgery was performed to wall off the defect in hopes that it may prevent spread. It was explained to me that there is no assurance it would be successful in this regard. The right eye is more severe, and I do have a blind spot in my upper-left field of vision in that eye (I never noticed it until my ophthalmologist pointed it out to me). Fast forward to today. I was initially told it wouldn't be an issue if I were to proceed with lasik in the future. During my pre-op lasik exam last week, the optometrist appeared very concerned and referred me back to my retina doc for an evaluation and clearance for lasik. Today I saw an ophthalmologist (same practice as before, different physician) who stated that the barrier appears to be holding and the schisis is at this point stable, as compared to two years ago. I asked again if lasik would be ok and he stated that there could be a higher risk of complications like detachment, but that the literature shows that there is an association, but not necessarily causal link between lasik and severe complications. The way he put it, I could have severe complications with or without lasik, and he cleared me for the procedure. So I've been reading about lasik and I'm reading that there is a lot of pressure placed on the eye, with changes in intraocular pressure etc. It makes me a little nervous and I thought I'd see if you fine folks had any input or guidance on the matter. Am I at a significantly higher risk of severe post op complications because of my condition? Or should I consider my risk level to be similar to any other myopic individual undergoing lasik? ",1

11245,"Hello! I am a 25F who's kinda freaking out right now. Last december I had an eye exam with an optometrist and got a new prescription. I am just worried because in a span of 11 months (jan 2020-dec 2020) my prescription went up to -1.00 Is that even normal? He said everything looks good except for my dry eyes. I also noticed that I get double vision when i'm using my new glasses while working. I can't stare at my computer or anything close with those glasses so I wear my old prescription whenever i'm looking at something close. After wearing the new glasses I noticed that even without them, my eye sight is getting blurry even when i'm just using my phone. It wasn't like this when I was using still using my old one or before getting a new prescription. Anyone else in their 20s and eye sight is still progressing? I'm sad. Sigh. I went back to my optometrist last Feb 11 because my sclera is always red and I feel like my eyes are always strained. So he said it was because of eye allergies and gave me Pataday and Systane Ultra. Got better however, I went to the doctor today (feb 27) for my follow up check up the redness is gone, still kinda dry but the redness cleared up. Told him that I have been seeing waves/mirage without wearing my glasses and so he checked my eye grade again and from -4.00 and -4.25 in a span of 2 months it is now -5.00. I'm so confused. He said that if my new prescription won't clear up the waves then he'll refer me to an ophthalmologist to check if I have the dry eye syndrome. Anyone else who experienced this?

11250,"I am still a newbie here, but I've seen a lot of symptom improvement with the diet recommended by the only nutritionist I've seen. Zero added sugars, gluten-free, and a bunch of other stuff. I detail it in a post low down on a thread called something like, ""Can drinking too much water DECREASE saliva?"" (& the answer to that one, according to my rheum, is no.) I never thought gluten was an issue for me, and I've read several articles about how no one needs to go gluten-free unless they're celiac, but I'm getting results so I don't want to mess with it. My nutritionist follows Dr. Fassano, who believes that gluten is an irritant to everyone. My Schirmer test is normal now (although my eyes were never extremely dry). My dental hygienist says she sees no signs of dry mouth, which was my worst symptom. (But I can tell it's not like it used to be. Also, note that I had a really abrupt onset of symptoms, so it's possible this was an initial flare that resolved as I made dietary changes.) Also--I used to be a big sugar and processed food fan.

11254,"I was encouraged to post this even though it is not specific, practical information because people might find it hopeful. So here goes, but don't ask me for more info because this is all I know: I have had RA for about decades and Sjogren's for at least 12 years with significant symptoms. I have ILD due to one of them, my rheumatologist said there is no way to know which one. I am on a biologic which really helps my RA, but we all know that as of right now there is no biologic treatment for Sjogren's. However, my rheumatologist said that there is research being done in Europe and he thinks that perhaps in 2023 there will be results published which are hopeful re JAK inhibitors or other pathways. The EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism, their equivalent to the ACR or American College of Rheumatology, i.e. a professional organization for rheumatologists) published this article which you can read for more info: [https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/3](https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/3) To summarize the main point, they say that much of the problem with prior research could be addressed by more careful selection of study participants, bigger placebo groups, and determining the genetics and separating out people who only have ""sicca-related disease"" from people who have systemic disease: . Therapeutic research in SjS should probably be reconsidered in order to explore new pathogenic targets outside the glandular tissue (ie, neuroendocrine pathways), and to search for a more personalised therapeutic approach based on genetic, clinical, immunological and/or histopathological characteristics. It is not improbable that future RCTs would benefit from more selected patient cohorts, possibly including newly diagnosed SjS patients, the findings of early salivary gland ultrasound changes,[101""<U+0080><U+009C>103](https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/3#ref-101) or evidence of early high disease activity at diagnosis[22](https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/3#ref-22) before permanent damage has been established and the changes are still reversible. Patients with sicca-limited disease differ from those with systemic disease, as do immune-negative patients from those carrying Ro autoantibodies or cryoglobulins, while recent etiopathogenic studies are beginning to divide SjS patients according to the genetic profile between those with or without a predominant IFN-I gene expression signature.[104""<U+0080><U+009C>106](https://ard.bmj.com/content/79/1/3#ref-104) Sensitivity analyses searching for a differentiated response to therapies in these subsets of patients (sicca-limited vs systemic; Ro+ vs Ro-; positive vs negative salivary gland biopsy; positive vs negative IFN-I signature) might help to better delineate the therapeutic effect of a drug tested in primary SjS, although this would require a greater number of patients randomised than those included in reported trials. DON'T get too excited if you read this article as it is from 2019 and the study on abatacept mentioned below did not have positive results, but again that may be due to the study design. It might be helpful for certain Sjogren's patients more than others. My rheumatologist said perhaps the JAK biologics will work better. With respect to ongoing trials, considerable interest is centred on the B cell survival factor (BAFF) pathway, investigating the effect of monoclonal antibodies targeting BAFF-receptor or the association between B-cell depletion and BAFF inhibition. In addition, studies are testing inhibition of other pathways activating B cells. Lastly, four ongoing trials are testing other pathways or the use of other cytokine-based therapies including tocilizumab, abatacept, filgotinib (a janus kinase inhibitor) and human recombinant Il-2. I'm a healthcare professional (not an MD) and our joke in my professional group was that the conclusion from every study is -- sadly, for us -- almost always ""more research is needed"". But what I like about this article is, as in the first quoted paragraph above, they are thinking about HOW to refine future research. Let's hope! ",0
11255,"NITM = near-induced transient myopia, this is basically myopia that results from extensive near work only for a short-period due to a spasm of the muscle responsible for accommodation, or focusing on near objections. We might also call this pseudomyopia. This study looked at additivity and decay of transient myopia in people with different refractive errors. The question of addivity is basically, does more time spent on near work = more pseudomyopia? The question of decay is how long does it take for the pseudomyopia to resolve i.e. for the near focusing muscles to relax? Near work can definitely lead to pseudo myopia in the short-term (like in the study). There may also be a connection between significant prolonged near work and the development of actual myopia, though this is somewhat controversial. In any case, taking a break every 20 minutes or so to look 20 feet away or more will likely increase visual comfort, decrease the likelihood of pseudo myopia, and may even protect you from myopic progression. That's just my two cents. ",0

Currently work night shift which requires me to stare at the computer screen for 40 hours per week. My eyes were completely fine before until a few months ago when they starting acting odd. Starting off my eyes felt a bit sticky when blinking and the bottom part of my eye felt like it was being squeezed a little as well as a lot of tearing (eyes felt wet when there are not a lot of tears). There was also a time where while going to the bathroom ( I don't know exactly why but it always happens when I go to my bathroom), I start to see static flashes of lights and lights that move all around my peripherals and some sort of pressure feeling as that happens. I initially thought it was perhaps pink eye or eye strain so I had some over the counter medications to treat it. After maybe 3 months or so it felt normal, my eyes were not watery, no stickiness etc. However, those static flashes of light and moving lights as I go to the bathroom still happen but not so often compared to before. There is also one thing where sometimes the light in my room seems darker than usual but this only happens around 9-11pm and after that it goes completely normal.

11259,"A couple of months ago I posted a thread asking other Sjogren patients for advice in dealing with brain fog, which is for me the most debilitating symptom this syndrome has cursed me with, and it's severely affecting my quality of life to the point that I feel utterly worthless -- I find it so hard to concentrate and retain new information that I can't possibly see how I could even function at a potential work place like that (the fact that Sjogren's is poorly understood and downplayed by doctors in my country doesn't help at all). Morever, I find it extremely difficult to describe the crippling effects of brain fog to others (even to my loved ones), and they seem to think that just because I look fine on the outside, it can't be that bad, and that perhaps I'm exaggerating (you know, the 'everyone's tried and forgetful, it happened to me too, take a nap/do some exercises and everything's going to be better' kind of talk). Those who replied to my other thread have provided me with great tips of how to psychologically deal with brain fog and inspired me to have a more optimistic outlook on life. For this, I'm truly grateful that I found this online community. However, no matter how hard I try, I still can't seem to deal with the Sjogren's-induced cognitive dysfunction, and I'm wondering if I'll ever find any relief. I'm 24 (M) and I want to, you know, find a job, be productive, put my intellectual skills to good use, start a family etc., but I can't do any of this without having a clear head. So, my question is: has anyone here tried any drugs that help, at least to a certain extent, with the brain fog? I've tried a bunch of natural supplements, nootropics (piracetam & pramiracetam), I've been prescribed drugs that are usually given to people with various forms of dementia, but to no avail. I was also prescribed Modafinil, a drug that supposedly alleviates fatigue (it is prescribed generally in narcolepsy) and enhances cognitive performance, but I felt just as groggy as usual upon taking it. Stimulents (like Concerta, Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin etc.) are not available in my country and, as far as I know, are considered illegal substances. I would greatly appreciate it if you could share some of your experiences with medications that have helped you with your brain fog. Thank you in advance & wish you all the best! ",1
11260,I guess my fear is the possibilty that I may have it one day. Your doctors didn't notice anything for 10 years even though you got symptoms in your teens? That worries me because I specifically asked all three doctors (especially the retina specialist) if I had RP and they said no and my eyes looked fine when they dilated. But then you say you had it but they didn't see it and that freaks me out. Did you have family history? That's terrifying that you were misdiagnosed! ,0
11261," My point is, and has always been, there won't be a significant/overwhelming difference to the patients vision. And my point is I think there will be for most people. I guess we will agree to disagree. I am basing my assessment of this Rx by solely relying on my experience dispending glasses and what people do and do not complain about and what people do and do not exclaim improvement about. Obviously this is highly subjective on my part, and the part of my patients. Of course there are those patients that seemly don't care at all about prescription changes, and yet others that claim they can differentiate .01D and <U+00BC> axis changes. There are 55 year people with +2.00 -1.25 x 090 with +2.25add that will tell you they see perfectly fine everywhere without glasses. But in my experience the majority of people would notice improvement between these two prescriptions(still just talking right eye obviously) if they are shown the difference between the two. I would say that there would be fewer people with complaints if they didn't have the reference of the other Rx to compare it to. In other words, If someone's ""correct"" Rx is -50 -75 x 090 and they are given -75 -.25 x 125, there would be less objections than if they were given the opportunity to trial frames both Rx. Because they have no reference that it could be better. What is significant in a clinical description is different than what is subjectively significant in a dispensing setting. ",0

Especially for Rx's where the edge is exposed so that it won't chip. And I don't think only kids with glasses should have their eyes protected. What I meant was that (at least I have learned) other materials, would create a more dangerous scenario than not having anything. But yeah if you pump up the center thickness it makes sense that it wouldn't be as dangerous. You're still left with a liability where I live however because of the precedent set by various lawsuits, so no matter what, everyone under 18 gets poly from me. ",0

I can take breaks but what about blue light? Do these glasses deteriorate our vision in any way? Similarly do eye exercises meant to relax our eyes make vision bad in any way?

No matter how much I try to explain keratoconus to my friends or family, I feel like no one truly understands how hard it is, both emotionally and physically.

11289,Hello. This has also taken a huge toll on my mental health and overall quality of life. I keep remembering the day all this started. I understand the frustration and pain when it comes to this horrible condition. Im 27 and it started when I was 26. Ive also tried everything but lipidflow and IPL and scleral lenses. Nothing really helped and it did it only helped a bit. I just started using serum tears 2 weeks ago and at first i felt really uncomfortable. I am now barely noticing some good effects from these drops. I know a person at work who have suffered from dry eyes for 10 years. Same BS we deal with. She has been using serum tears for about a year and it completely changed her life. She got her life back. I recommend trying serum tears and if it doesn't help try out scleral lenses. I usually use refresh artificial drops 5 mins after using serum tears and i feel okay. Do not give up hope. There will be a solution for you. Do not give up please. Ive been there. ,1
11290,"I can relate... I've been waering RGP lenses for about 10 years now. The fitting was a real pain in the butt especially on my right eye on which the keratoconus is very advanced in the last stage and on which I have a large scar on my cornea which prevented my lense from ever fitting correctly on that eye. Since my contacts have always been kinda uncomfortable I was using a lot of preservative free solutions and drops the meant to imitate tears. I used ""Hylo Comod"" which can be used while wearing your4 contacts. In addition my eyes got very sticky and my vision got very blurry over long day with warm and dry air around me for which I couldn't find anything for a long time. For a almost a year now tho, I have a daily eye cleaning routine in the morning where I clean my eye lids. There are certain pores on the brink of the eye lid that give off an oily solution that is part of your natural tears. My pores are clogged tho from time to time which makes it diffucult. I'm using ""Lipo Nit"" for this. Regarding scleral lenses. I'm currently switching to full scleral lenses at the moment because wearing the corneal lense became to painful on my right eye. I got the first scleral lense on nmy right eye in MArch and I'm absolutely in love with them. It took two tries to make it right but the final feeling was jsut great. Or should I say there was no feeling at all since I couldn't tell if I was wearing any lenses at all. Noe I could even roll my eyes without having my lenses disappear somewhere behind my eye lids... I also haven't had any issues with my scleral lense and my environment. Not with dust. Not with wind. Not with rain. The only problem that I have is that I sometimes have to change the solution at some point of the day because my vison gets a bit blurry. Mostly I have to do that 1 or 2 hours after I put them in first. I use little saline vials without any preservatives to fill my contact lense. I would also suggest that you keep trying to find a better fitting lense. If you keep struggeling with your mini scleral lenses you could think about upgrading to the really big ones. They look a bit intimidating but they feel great and nowadays, they are really safe to use and you don't have to fear that your eye suffers from lack of oxygen. I hope things work out for you! ",0

I feel like my eye issue is being kicked around a bit and I want to limit the amount of covid exposure with multiple visits to multiple drs. I'm 40, prediabetic (taking metformin and trying to lose weight, have lost 35lbs so far). My glucose and a1c is being carefully monitored by endo and pcp and is trending in the right direction. I'm almost no longer in prediabetic range. I have had optic neuritis 3 times. Unexplained. In my right eye. Over the course of like 15 years. After the third time I got an MRI which was fine. That was 6 years ago. Lasting impact was reduced saturation and it basically is probably to blame for the initial 20/20 to 2/40 change in my right eye. My vision in my right eye only has gone from 20/40 to 20/150 in ten months. Actually it's been 12 months now and I believe it's continued to have gotten worse since my last check two months ago since my brand new glasses already aren't *perfect*. It's correctable to 20/20 with glasses. My night vision is shit (all the lights glow). My optometrist notes I have issues on my amsler grid in both eyes that don't correlate with anything she can see. Says my macula looks great. So two months ago I saw the optometrist. Because over the course of that 10 months my right eye vision turned to shit and I was getting headaches and couldn't drive safely. She couldn't find anything in her exam to explain the decrease in vision and sent notes to my endo and pcp saying it was probably diabetic neuropathy. Both doctors were like NOPE because I don't have diabetes nor uncontrolled sugars. So my pcp called me this weekend and said he's super concerned and he wants me to see an ophthalmologist ASAP. 1.

11298,"Hi everyone. I'm 29 years old and I have hyperopia and strabismus since I was 5. I had strabismus surgery in 1997, when I was 6, and it went okay, but I had to continue wearing glasses and eventually, strabismus came back. I also developed amblyopia in my right eye. For several years, my deviation was very low, so I didn't mind using glasses. I even could do sports without them as my eyesight wasn't that bad. In 2005 I started wearing contacts and I continued using them for years. Sometimes, my eye started deviating again and I had to change my prescription to find a balance for my eyes not to stress and get tired. In 2019, after +10 years without problems, one day while I was working, my eye started to go out of focus and deviating time and time again. It happened during the next few days and I went to see an ophthalmologist, who changed my prescription (which was +2.25(L) , +3.00(R)) to a +2.00, +3.00, which made things better for a couple of weeks, until I started to lose control again. Those months I visited 5 or 6 doctors who gave me contacts from +2.00 to +3.50 for me to try on and see which one worked better, but none did, and I started getting depressed. This year I started trying multifocal contacts, and they seem much better than monofocals for my strabismus. I tried anything from Low Add to High Add. I was able to reduce my deviation, but my long distance view got worse, blurry. Whenever I try to make it clearer, I gain more deviation, so I'm in a situation where I don't know what to do. Headaches are common everyday, and I feel that my eyes will get crossed any time, which is makes me anxious. Surgery is not an option. Every doctor told me that. It seems that my accommodation is to high and, as it can be ""corrected"" with glasses and contacts, nobody wants to take the risk. So yeah... I'm in a very uncomfortable situation, and in the past 2 years my life has changed abruptly because of my eyes and strabismus that I can't even control with glasses or contacts anymore. I'd love to hear suggestions and similar experiences. Thanks everyone. ",1

I remember the experience being completely overwhelming. Putting them in at the clinic then driving home with my mum I was in a state of shock and pure happiness. I felt like I'd just found the switch to turn on Ultra 4K HD vision, when before I was seeing life through a shitty old broken VHS. I remember looking outside the car window and watching the world go by and just crying with joy. It had been so long since I'd seen the world so clearly. I remember getting home and sitting on my bed and just staring at my hands for about an hour.

You must have an older rheumatologist. Definitely get a second opinion. I dunno some of the tests you mentioned, but it seems to me like the Sjogren's specific ones weren't as strong as the others were, so there is a chance you could be right, and don't have Sjogren's. Although, it is definitely possible to have Sjogren's without the dry symptoms. I also have had a myriad of GI tests and all the scopes this year to see why my inflammation (CRP) was high.

11309,I only recently learned that retinol can cause dry eye. I've dry eyes for 20y or so. However my skin has always been v sensitive (can't use vit c or niacinamide products for example) so I have never used hard core retinol products. I do use The Ordinary's Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion. I don't associate it with making my eyes worse. The main issue I have is that I have developed dermatitis on my eyelids I'd say from all the scrubbing at my eyelid margin to try and keep it clear of blepharitis. I've bought a specialist product now for that and it does make my eyes feel dry. I spoke to the chemist and she recommended la roche posay eye cream as being mild enough for the eyelid. That is working for me at the moment. Otherwise I use NIOD products for skincare. I use their oily wash and their copper serum. Plus repigment for skin tone and the retinoid I mentioned above. I also use la Roche posay basic moisturiser and a face wash too. I'd say NIOD while great is aimed at older women. At 28 the main thing you should be using every day is sun screen.

I checked in the mirror and I found that my left eye becomes crossed. When I wear my glasses, it mostly goes away. I went to an ophalmologist who said no need to do anything if it doesn't bother me. I am wondering though what can cause this? Could it be something serious? The ophalmologist didn't really say. ",1

11315,"Hi guys. I was diagnosed in 1998 (still in college). Had a horrible experience with hard contacts for almost three years - they gave me more corneal abrasions than I care to remember. I would start wearing them, follow the schedule, get used to them, get a corneal abrasions, have to stop and then rinse and repeat. I gave up on them and was functioning essentially blind in one eye until cross linking and Holcomb procedure about 5 years ago. My vision is still 20/60 in the good eye and 20/80 in my bad. I absolutely refused to wear contact based on my experience 20+ years ago. My doctor (korneal specialist) strongly, strongly suggests scleral contacts now. Tells me they are a life changer and will do wonders for my eyes both vision-wise and comfort-wise. I am having serious PTSD when it comes to contacts. So two questions - what's your opinion on them? Especially as they compare to old school hard contacts. And secondly - anyone in Chicago has a recommendation for a good scleral contact person? I know I can't just go to anyone. My doctor recommended someone but it is a person in his practice. I want to see if there is a specialist out there that you guys tried and trust. Thank you so much! ",0

11320,"Hi, I'm a 24 year old male, I was first diagnosed with keratoconus when I was 16 and it has steadily been getting worse since. In that span of time I've had 3 operations, 1 Keraring operation for my right eye and 1 Collagen cross linking for both my eyes. The last operation I had was about 3 years ago. While I won't say my vision is perfect with glasses I can see pretty clearly if the conditions are right. I can see close objects sharply and they've said it's sorta better than 20/20 vision. The problem is, I still see various after effects that really bother me, like they drive me nuts sometimes. My vision is plagued by ghost images and double vision. The light from a bright source bleeds into the darkness of the scene and it just ruins everything. The doctors once said a special type of contact lense might help, but my vision isn't bad enough to fit the criteria. The problem is my current vision feels really bad to me and is driving me nuts. What can I do? Are there any special contact lenses that exist? What can I ask my doctor next? Thanks in advance! ",1
11321,"Yes, you do have to insert and remove your contact lenses every day. It is tricky at first but most people get pretty good at it within a few weeks. They shouldn't be uncomfortable if they fit well. But getting a good fit can be a challenge for KC patients. You want to find the best fitter you can. You need someone with the experience and the patience needed to fit KC patients. Because KC is rather rare, only a few contact lens fitters become good KC lens fitters. Some doctors are better than others at prescribing glasses for KC patients. I have had KC for over 50 years. When I was first diagnosed, KC lenses and fitting technology was primitive compared to today. I wore glasses for many years because they couldn't find comfortable contact lenses for me. When I found someone who had the knack for prescribing glasses for me, I stuck with them until they retired. Here are a few ideas that might help with helping your doctor find a good glasses prescription. The critical part of the exam is the subjective refraction with the phoropter. This is where you look through the funky ""glasses"" and select ""which is better, 1 or 2?"" Remember, it is the prescription that is being tested, not you. You are the grader. Don't strain or use tricks to try to see better. Just try to give each lens prescription presented to you an honest review based on the way you'd want to see through your glasses. Rather than trying to decide which image is better, something that has less meaning for someone with KC, try selecting the image you prefer. If both are bad, maybe in different ways, just say so. Same if both images are OK and you don't have a preference. If you can describe what makes the images bad, that may help your doctor. If you have a good rapport with your doctor, which is really helpful for KC patients, you might pass on these tips: ""Use 0.50DS steps or more when assessing sphere and cyl. It is often easier to assess the cyl before finalizing sphere correction, as large amounts of uncorrected astigmatism cause excessive ghosting."" That is advice for fitting Kerasoft contact lenses, but it would apply to any subjective refraction of a KC patient. What makes prescribing glasses tricky for KC patients is that you can't just methodically zero in on a good prescription like you can with normal eyes. With KC, things can get better, then worse, then better again as they try a series of lenses. Your doctor may have to spend time just jumping around trying to find the magic combination of sphere and cylinder power that works for you. You need someone who finds this interesting and is willing to spend the time playing with things. It will help if you can book your appointment at a time when the office is less busy and ask that they give the doctor extra time to spend with you because of your KC. I have seen some surprisingly good result with glasses despite my KC. My doctors have sometimes let on that they were surprised too. ",0
11322,"22F. So as I have posted on here before, I had initial bloods and my inflammation markers were normal, plus everything else seemed fine. I have had dry eyes (for definite, confirmed by optician) for two years, and a dry mouth since the beginning of lockdown-ish (plus recurrent UTIs, but idk if that's relevant). Since all the corona stuff my symptoms have gone mad. My eyes used to flare occasionally and then literally feel normal for months on end with literally one lot of drops per day. I suddenly have what feels like a really dry mouth and throat and my eyes are so much worse. However, weirdly my dentist said he couldn't see any evidence of dry mouth and said I may have pseudo-xerostomia. My rheumatologist said I may just have 'sicca' and I had more specific bloods and everything was negative: rheumatoid factor, connective tissue disease screen etc. They said that I'm to treat it symptomatically, and that I do not have a diagnosis. I am supposed to have a follow up soon and just want some advice about what I should ask for. I have health anxiety so I'm absolutely losing my mind over this wondering if it could still be Sjogrens and how much worse it could get etc. My family/boyfriend/friends are convinced that this is all in my head and so I'm just feeling so confused. I don't want to go against the health professionals, but I literally haven't even been seen in person so part of me wonders how they can possibly diagnose (or not) in those circumstances.

11330,"Hi everyone. I'm a 27yo woman, severely nearsighted (don't remember my prescription anymore, but it was above -10 for both my eyes, with a little bit of astigmatism in both). I had ICL surgery when I was 23. The reason for this was because I had stopped being able to tolerate contact lenses at 21, after 5 years of consistent use. I developed chronic dry eyes that were never successfully treated - I tried different things for them, never worked, and learned how to simply manage day by day. Because of my severely high myopia and having to go back to wearing impossibly thick glasses, I became depressed. People started making fun of me again just like they did in school. The guy I was seeing literally broke up with me over this. I couldn't go to the beach anymore because everything was so blurry, it caused me panic attacks. I quit surfing, which I loved, because of this. I thought my life was over. I tried very hard and pleaded with several doctors to let me try alternative kinds of contact lenses, like RGPs or sclerals. I was particularly excited about sclerals since they seem to be indicated for people with dry eye. My doctors always dismissed me, saying contacts would never work for me after what he had happened, and so did my parents. No one advocated for me and I was too young and too much of a pushover to advocate for myself. Eventually, and because my prescription was stable for several years, I was told I could get ICLs. LASIK was obviously always out of the question due to my prescription. I got the surgery done and my vision was never 20/20, there was always some residual nearsightedness and astigmatism that was never fully corrected. I never minded this because I hadn't been fully corrected in years anyway, and my sight was quite good and clear. Lately I've been wondering about what my options are if my vision worsens. I do not want to wear glasses ever again after the amount of unhappiness and trauma they've given me. I was talking to my mother about wearing contact lenses if I ever needed them again, and she casually dropped a bomb on me - ""the doctor told us after your surgery that you'll never be able to wear contact lenses again""<U+009D>. They hadn't told me this before. Will I never be able to try wearing contacts again after ICL? If this is the case I would've never gone forward with the surgery back then and would've pressed more for scleral lenses. What are my options if my vision worsens in the future? Is glasses really the only thing I can do? Are sclerals just not a possibility anymore? ",1
11331,"Clear vision is a great thing. Most young eyes are correctable to a visual acuity of 20/15, which is the first line beneath 20/20. With 20/15 vision, under good contrast, a person can make out objects separated by 1 foot at a distance of 4,500 feet. If a letter from an eye chart was constructed on a 5x5 grid the size of a 1-foot square, a person with 20/15 vision could just detect the letter from 300 yards away. This is about the limit of visual acuity for most eyes, though exceptional refractive media allow some lucky people to see as small as 20/12 or even 20/10. With 20/15 vision, one can make out the positioning of individual turbofans on a jet flying 35,000 feet overhead. Individual floors on city towers may be seen from 5-10 miles away. You can see a tractor trailer from over 20,000 feet overlooking a highway from atop a hillside. ",0
11332,"About 20 months ago, I woke up with Bell's Palsy affecting the left side of my face. I'm one of the unlucky that never recovered. I had temporary sutures closing my left eyelids, after 6 months they stretched themselves undone. I then got a 1.8gm gold weight implanted. Aesthetically, it causes severe left eyelid droop, and I still cannot completely close that eye. I've seen 3 ophthalmologists, all within the same small-town hospital system. Their only suggestions to deal with the severe evaporative dry eye are artificial tears and ointment at night. The artificial tears (and I've tried many kinds) do nothing, they are gone in minutes. The ointment (Lacrilube seems the best), I'm applying 3-4 times a day, so of course I have extremely blurred vision in that eye. The ointment does help some, it's the only way I'm making it through. But I cannot use that eye for vision, I constantly have oil running down my face, and if I'm anywhere near a vent or fan (in Texas summer), I suffer for a few days after with painful irritation.

11338,Hello ! 17F here with a family history of glaucoma (my dad had surgery to prevent it and my grandma has it). My prescription is -7 for myopia and -2 for astigmatism on one eye and -1.25 on the other. My IOP is pretty high. When they first measured it it was 22 on both. When they took it again it was 19.7 and 18.7 which is above average. Should I be concerned ? ,1
11339,"Thanks, I am glad you find them informative. Side effects: 1. When I take them out at night (16 hours of wear), they leave a temporary indentation on my sclera (white part of eye). This usually goes back to its normal position within an hour. I told my doctor about this and they said it is normal and does not negatively impact the health of the eye. 2. This also happens when I remove the lenses, my eyes get extremely bloodshot for at least 30 minutes. This is a reaction as the lens is pulled off of the sclera. Blood rushes to the area as the tissue rebounds to the normal position. Again, this is normal and not harmful, according to my doctor. Precautions: 1. I don't wear them in the shower and I never take a nap in them under any circumstances. â€”â€” Hypoxia risk is always present, as with any contact lens. My sclerals are made of an extremely oxygen permeable material that allows more oxygen to pass through than most soft contact lenses. I don't take them out for 18 hours after I put them in. I was told by my doctor that this is fine, but if my eyes started to feel irritated, remove the lenses. It's never been an issue. The first week I had the sclerals, I did have bubbles under the lenses after installation a couple times. This required immediate removal and reinstall. But now that it's been 6 months, I never have the issue. I can have both installed in about 1 minute (30 seconds per eye). It sounds like your eye doc isn't well trained in sclerals and fitting (no offense). My doc had the proper fit and lens shape within 5 minutes. Also taught me to install them in another 5 minutes. Your doc is correct in that if bubbles start forming at the edge of the lens, something is wrong with the fit and would need to be removed immediately. You want a good seal to keep the tear exchange minimal. Also means the lens is properly resting on your eye for optimal visual clarity. There are GP lenses that are more oxygen permeable than soft lenses. These are the lenses I wear (with the HydraPEG coating): https://www.artoptical.com/products/ampleye 6 months ago, before my sclerals, I was also in that deep dry-eye induced depression. I was using hundreds of dollars of OTC lubricating eye drops and several hundred dollars per month on prescription eye medications (steroids, Xiidra). I was so pissed. I paid 8k cash for the best, newest version of LASIK available. And it almost ruined my life. I tried everything and nothing kept my eyes moist enough to not feel dry. It severely impacted my visual acuity. I couldn't drive in low light and in the daytime I had severe halos and glare on just about object. Fast forward to today, I have sclerals. But I can see better than ever before in my life. It feels like I can see forever. Night vision is fine. My eyes never feel dry. I don't spend hundreds of dollars on eye drops every month. Life is better. Definitely look into sclerals again. Let me know if you have any questions! ",0

If you were in my position, what would you do? I honestly don't use my GP lenses much right now because they cause a lot of ""sharp"" ghosting.

My left eye which feels a little weak with my current (8/4/17) script has no cylinder or axis at the moment. The new script has an OS cylinder and axis of -0.5 and 150 respectively. I know nothing of optometry, and its hard to find information online. I am not asking for medical advice, but rather if this is a feasible change - or - if the doctor may have just made a slip up and put the cylinder/axis on the wrong eye. The sphere seems to match up well and correctly. I have attached the newer (printed) script and the older (hand written) script for comparison. Thanks in advance! ",0
11351," So it's OK if the lenses come in different from what was prescribed because I order them differently. You can't just willy nilly ordered them differently. If the Rx is adjusted for frame fit values then yes. Opticians have been doing this for decades. It has been lost due to the uneducation of the profession. Now it is back into the mainstream with freeform lenses. If a patient is a -12.00 refracted at 13.75mm but the frame they are getting sits as 10mm you can't just order a -12.00, they will be a half diopter over minused. The Rx needs to be ordered as a -11.50 so the patient gets the correct power when wearing the glasses. Adjusting the rest of the Rx for tilt and wrap is just a very much more complicated version of this. ANSI Z80.1-2020 states: . Both uncut and edged finished lenses shall meet the following requirements. For lenses produced with ""as-worn""<U+009D> compensations, the tolerances in clause 5 **apply to those values specified by the supplier of the spectacle component or completed spectacles and not to the prescribed power.** -emphasis is mine. Yes, axis will change depending of frame fit. Axis can change dramatically in the case of sport frames with high tilt and wrap. As I said there is no way for you to know if the axis is off by what OP posted. The ordered axes are 15 and 114. You would need to read the lenses in the lensmeter and compare them to these numbers then apply the ANSI tolerance guidelines. ",0

11353,"The power of your focus is determined by the curvature of your lens and cornea. Astigmatism is when one or both structures (usually the cornea) curves in one direction more than the other (like an egg or football). Therefore, glasses correction must account for different directions instead of assuming all sides curve equally. There is nothing that can be done to prevent astigmatism changes. It's a result of the shape of physical structures in the eyes. It typically stays the same, or very similar, through out life.

11357,"Hello everyone, I'm in the same boat as you with keratoconus in both eyes. I've just strated wearing scleral lesnes and have a question. So when I put only one lens I see correctly, everything is fine. But when I wear both of them I don't see that well. If I hide one eye I see correctly (working for both). But when I open both eyes with lenses I see a bit less clearly than with only one eye with lenses. I guess it is because I need some time for my brain and eyes to adapt to this new vision. But is it normal ? Did you had this too ? I need to precize I have been around 10 years without wearing lenses or glasses and I gess my brain was so used to keratoconus that now I need to relearn how to see normaly.

11358,"Hey guys, it's been a while since I last posted here. Anyway I've been wearing my glasses full time mostly and eventually I got used to them. I've been doing a lot of reading up on my conditions and was curious about something. I saw that if you have a very strong compound anisometropia glasses aren't recommended due to the major difference between the lenses. Well here is my prescription for my glasses I currently use that I posted here before. https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/553840734613274637/887511435259830343/PXL_20210613_0148501772. jpg The glasses so far work fine for me, even with such a major difference between both eyes, but I read something about the possibility of breaking the suppression between both eyes, as my brain favors my left eye over my right eye. Could this happen? And could this cause any changes in my vision? At first I had an awful time trying to adjust to these glasses, but after several weeks, I've gotten used to them now where everything looks mostly normal and the double vision has mostly cleared up. I went back to see my eye doctor for a checkup on the glasses and my vision is now 20/20 in both eyes with the glasses and she said that my eyes are both perfectly aligned. Still though, I wonder if the glasses are really appropriate for me or if I should talk to my doctor about contacts. So far they've been working perfectly fine except for the slight distortion I have that comes naturally with glasses, but other then that everything else checks out. Should I ask my doctor about contacts? Thanks guys. Edit I'm 28 btw. ",1

If you know of a more appropriate sub, please let me know and I'll post that there. Anyways, I wear contacts since 2017 (give or take) and I never changed my contacts dealer, but now I have been meaning to do some research and figure out if I can't get my contacts for cheaper. So, I searched around and found several websites that sell contacts online, and since I usually never worry about what I put in my eyes (since I always got mine from the same place I get my eyes tested), a bunch of questions popped up, due to ignorance. 1. What materials should I be looking out for? Do I NEED to get silicone hydrogel, or would normal hydrogel suffice? And what is it about the materials like ""Tetrafilcon A"" and such, what are the key differences between them? 2. I found ""yearly"" contact lenses, instead of my usual ""monthly"" ones. I never heard of them, but on paper they seem like the perfect contacts for me, and they are also cheaper in the long run. The lenses in question are Coopervision Kontur 38s. Are they a good idea? 3. Is checking out contacts on a website even trustworthy, or should I just stick with the contacts stores I am already familiar with? (Which seem to be more expensive). 4. Should I even be considering checking for myself what contacts to buy (assuming of course that they match my prescription), or should I just let a professional decide which ones should I take? Sure, this is overall the safest solution, and the one I have been using all this time, but I'm afraid that I might have been taken advantage of pricewise. I think these are all that I got thus far. I would go to ask this to my optometrist, but I wanted to make sure I can get an opinion from someone that isn't trying to sell their product to me. Thanks for the help, in advance! ",0

But I don't think I've ever met anyone with vision nearly as bad as mine, and people are always shocked by how blind I am without correction (especially at my age). I guess the uncommoness of my degree of vision impairment has made me wonder - Is this is an abnormality? And what factors could potentially cause such significant visual deterioration in someone my age? Some background: I first started wearing glasses when I was around 7 or 8. I played soccer and tennis throughout my childhood, so I also ended up getting contacts when I was 10 since glasses posed a bit of a hazard. I watched TV and played video games as a kid (though only started playing video games after I already had glasses), but likely much less than the average kid my age and most definitely less than kids do now. Overall, my family lived a fairly healthy lifestyle. Dad and brother have almost perfect vision. My mom has bad vision, but I don't think as bad as mine, and her vision loss may have partially been due to trauma from when she was younger. I always saw an optometrist at least annually, and aside from the issue of my vision progressively getting worse over the years, he always commented that my eyes were super healthy. Can anyone shed some light on why a young person with healthy eyes, living a healthier-than-average lifestyle would have such extreme vision loss? ",1

After a half hour, she told me that I needed to get my cornea checked up using the pentacam. I was groggy and agreed. She then gave me a 2nd round of eye drops, after a further 10 minute wait, she did the pentacam test. Upon returning home, I looked up youtube & google. Both said that pentacam has to be done b4 dilation or putting of any drops. So I feel that I was cheated by the dr assistant... who performed the test incorrectly while my pupils were dilated..

11370,"Hi all, I'm 25 and a year ago I was diagnosed with keratoconus. As far as I was told, my case is not as serious and my vision has been deteriorating so much in past year (I'm still using same glasses from more or less 4 years ago). This is just for context. The first specialist suggested to only perform cross linking on my right eye and then see how the condition progresses on my left eye and decide then. The reason for that is because she said the right eye is a little worse (my sight there is quite bad, while my left eye sight is pretty fine even without glasses). Then covid started and I set aside this topic. And recently I decided to ask for a second opinion, and the second specialist said that the keratoconus is more or less the same on both eyes and the procedure would be to insert intra corneal rings in both eyes and after that perform cross linking. So should I maybe see a third specialist? What are your experiences with intra corneal rings? I read around past posts and some say they are not worth it, some say they even helped improve vision, and others even removed it due to halos. So I hope you understand why I'm uncertain here. ",1

This change is also reflected when I use spectacles. The Ghosting has increased drastically too. 3. The quality of the vision, has also decreased, with Sclerals in the same eye during the same period. The glasses, I am using was given to me 4 months back. I made my Scelerals 7 months back.

If he says no, then don't go looking for other opinions. If you get enough consults someone will eventually say yes and that is not a good thing. When you are in your 20's you'll be considered a better candidate for procedures usually but an ICL may be a better option for you or even a clear lens exchange.

11405,"I was diagnosed with mild GPC in March after wearing gas permeable lenses for 16 years. I'm only symptomatic in my right eye (burning/pain of the eyelid). I stopped wearing my gas permeable lenses and did a long steroid drop taper (first durezol then lotemax combined with pataday) for roughly 3 months. I also use preservative free rewetting drops and do warm compresses twice a day. My optometrist switched me to dailies and I have only worn them 3 times since April. Despite this, I still have mild pain in my eyelid that is bearable, however whenever I wear any makeup (especially mascara or eyeliner) my right eyelid pain flares significantly. I have switched to almay brand as recommended by my optometrist and wash my eyelids diligently at night, but I still struggle with flares. Does makeup intolerance typically occur with GPC? ",0
11406,"I understand your frustration. My daughter, who is 13, isn't able to get CXL done and she needs it. The price for it, here in the US, is ridiculous. Her uncorrected vision is 40/200 in her left eye and 40/100 in her right eye. With glasses, can't do contacts it's 20/50 in her left eye and 20/40 in her right eye. Just keep close eye on how your eyes feel and if you feel that something is off try and get a hold of your specialist. ",0
11407,"Also, if your eyes get dry use i-drop by pur, it has no preservatives and it's scleral friendly. I was advised to use the drug store eye lubricants at night and I drop pur in the day while wearing or before putting on my lenses. I don't follow it religiously, I just see how my eye feels. The reason being, your eye is closed and not lubricating while you sleep and it is dry after you wakeup, therefore you hydrate at night so it isn't as dry and in the morning to combat from you not blinking and lubricating your eye all night while you slept. Also, your eye is much more dry in the winter and spring (allergies). the drugstore eye lubricant drops have preservatives and will cause your lens to develop a buildup deposits on the scleral lenses in the long run. If that happens you'll need to send back your lens to your fitter to get it repolished sooner. (my lens fitter advised against the drug store eye drops because they have certain ingredients that cause the lenses to build up proteins/muscous deposits quicker and you will need to polish your lens quicker.) I also get my lenses polished by the cleaner because overtime protein and muscous builds up). My lens fitter has been doing his job for 50 years and he mass produces lenses to opthalmologists and optometrists. He is the manufacturer for most of the businesses in my city. I'm a very advanced case, my opthalmologist sent me to him when she couldn't fit me and he saved my right eye. They were going to give me a transplant for my right eye because my right eye couldn't tolerate rgps. He has a lab and everything, really cool to see. Unfortunately he's really old and I hope he lives forever. You will have to be very mindful of what you put on your face or what gases your near. Hairspray is made of silicones (plastic) and if you spray it while wearing your lenses the silicone binds to your lenses and the whole thing will be garbage and chemically binded. I know this because it happened to me when I was working in hair salons with my lenses. Your lenses are gas permeable and it can absorb stuff. Be wary of perfumes as well. Hot air near stoves. It could also be the fit. It took me around 3-5 months to be fitted correctly. Make sure to also check in with your fitter cause sometimes that could be it too. Hope this helps and hang in there.

I've got a tumour 2/3rds the size of my eyeball growing in my eyesocket. Got my diagnosis for that 2 months after my Keratoconus diagnosis.. it was a terrible few months. Due to the pandemic I've not been able to have it removed yet, but thankfully they're certain it's non-cancerous. But it's not ideal at all! ",0

11412,"If it's advanced, chances are (just like me) that it's too late for CXL as it only stop the progression. Your brother might want to seek a ophthalmologist that is up to date on KC and that will give him a prescription to get fitted with either RGP or Sclerals lenses. It won't stop the progression but it will allow him to get back most if not all his vision. In my experience, rgp was a disaster and I've never been able to wear them more than an hour after 17 pairs of lenses, but sclerals did wonder and I've ben wearing them since. There's also the surgical way, with either corneal implant or corneal transplant, his vision won't be the best, but it often allow patient to be able to wear only glasses""<U+00A6>. but keep in mind that transplant is the last option on the list and that it should really be done the latest you can as it's a circle where he need to get another transplant once the graft is too <U+00AB>old<U+00BB>.

11413,"Your doctor is really good. You are lucky that you got diagnosed so early. It's a blessing, not a fraud. I had sjogren's for at least 15 years, but got diagnosed only a year ago. For most of my life I suffered from dryness in my eyes, mouth, skin etc. But I never thought of it as something serious. I thought it was just the dry climate. And my doctors never thought of ordering any sorts of tests despite my growing complaints. It's their negligence that lead to the worsening of my symptoms. And only when I could no longer move without excruciating pain they got concerned. So you are really lucky you are able to catch the disease so early on. This will make it more manageable and assure that it doesn't progress. So don't worry about anything, find a good rheumatologist and work out a good plan to keep the disease from progressing. Good luck. ",0
11414,"I have lived with KC for over 50 years. I wore the predecessor of RGP lenses, NON-gas permeable corneal lenses, for about 2 years until, overnight, I couldn't wear them any longer. I suspect this was due to my KC progressing. Realize that back at this time there was no such thing as corneal topography. It was hard for eye doctors to know exactly what was going on with KC. Fortunately, my KC was mild in my right eye. A few optometrists had ""the touch"" and could get a pretty good vision correction with glasses. So I have lived most of my life relying primarily on my right eye and glasses. And this was all long before CXL was available. ",0

11420,"Cornea specialist here - PTK (or phototherapeutic keratectomy) is a laser procedure that is used to get rid of scars on the surface of the cornea. It is not considered ""refractive surgery"" where the goal is to achieve a specific refractive target or necessarily improve your uncorrected vision. Did you mean to ask about PRK (photorefractive keratectomy)? That is a procedure similar to LASIK without cutting a flap first. There are several experimental protocols combining CXL and PRK with various results. In my opinion, CXL followed by scleral lenses is your safest bet for optimizing your vision at this time. Perhaps in the next 10 years or so we will have a more reliable and approved refractive surgery or PRK protocol for keratoconus. ",0

If you were 10 I'd be a bit more concerned but you're not far from the typical age range so I wouldn't consider it a big concern. My understanding is that it generally does progress further. The root cause is unknown and I'm not familiar with what treatment options there may be. Do you experience any symptoms? I'd recommend regular visits with your optometrist to manage it the best you can! ,0

11427,"You should see an ophthalmologist, preferably a corneal specialist, if you haven't already. I agree that a mild case of KC when you are 32 is less worrisome than it would be if you were younger. But KC is nothing if not unpredictable. While it probably won't get too much worse, there is always the small chance that it will get quite a bit worse. And while it probably won't change too quickly if it does change, there is a small chance that it will change quickly (like in a few months). Your ophthalmologist should provide a plan for managing your KC. That probably should include corneal topography at 3 to 6 month intervals initially and then going to annually if your KC looks stable. If your KC is still progressing at a noticeable rate, corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) will probably be recommended. CXL is highly effective for stopping the progression of KC. If the double vision (monocular diplopia) is bothersome, wearing special contact lenses may reduce or eliminate the double vision and provide better vision than glasses. Find the best lens fitter you can with the experience, resources, and patience needed to fit KC patients. Best wishes for successfully managing your KC. ",0
11428,"Hi! I've worn ortho-k lenses for 10+ years and am looking to get lasik. My contacts don't give me the clearest vision which has led me to wear them only when I need to see clearly the next day (maybe 1-2 times a week?). My prescription is correct and I've had the same prescription for 5 years now, which -1.75/-1.75 x180 in both eyes. My prescription is stable and I am approaching my mid-20s which I think is a good time to get lasik. Soft contacts and glasses are uncomfortable for me, and I would really like to get lasik this year. Do you think lasik is worth it at that prescription? My optometrist has told me several times that my prescription is quite ""low"" and would not be worth it, but to me it's frustrating that even when I wear my ortho-k lenses consistently, my vision isn't as clear as I'd like and other non-permanent options don't work for me.

I did find an science publication that found what they called eating ""high"" amounts of greens while on warfarin keeps someone's INR (how they measure how the med is working) more stable... then at the end they finally tell you that they consider ""high"" to be 90mcg of K per day. Not much more than my 80 where I feel like I'm barely eating any. I do know there are plenty of people who can do well by simply eating the same amount of K containing foods each day or averaging it weekly, but for me that average really does have to be low. It's just a bummer. edit for future readers who come across this post and are on warfarin themselves: I am currently taking 10 mg 5 days per week, and 5mg two days per week (those on warfarin will understand that is kind of weird dosing is ""normal"") and they really don't want me taking much more. Typically they try to keep even strict vegan and vegetarians on 10mg/day or less since at higher doses one day of stomach upset that leads to less k that day and your INR can skyrocket. (when I was new to warfarin and just figuring this all out I did have INRs of 5 and that requires a quick dose of high k and some monitoring, not something I want to repeat!). ",0

11439,"I was in middle school when I started having a hard time reading, glasses didn't work, I was in 8th grade when I was diagnosed. I spent a lot of time trying different contact lens' and in senior year I had my first cross linking procedure. It didn't improve my vision much, but we were just trying to stop the progression. In college I made it through, but I could feel my eyes getting worse. After graduation I had another cross linking procedure, this time a little more aggressive Epi-off procedure. Only my left eye was a candidate at this time, my right eye wasn't a candidate anymore because the cornea was too thin. I started scleral lens' and this helped me so much! I was comfortable. Overall there were just so many times I would have cornea abrasions and have to take time off of school or work. Until scleral lens' I always felt uncomfortable. I love reading and felt so much frustration that I couldn't easily do it, it was a chore, only when I got scleral lens' I was able to fill on dive into that hobby. I started a book club, I also started studying to go back to school and become a nurse. I have always loved studying and having keratoconus has given my an extra challenge to push through, it's so frustrating that not many people could understand. It made me feel like I was complaining a lot, like I didn't have a right to complain, people wear contacts and it's normal... but with me there was pain, and a grave uncertainty of my future. As a nurse I work 12 hour shifts, and when the pandemic started I picked up extra shifts to help out at the hospital. Long hours strained my eyes, and I started getting corneal abrasions again. Eventually I went to see a cornea specialist because my abrasions persisted and I found out it was actually corneal hydrops in my right eye - I needed a cornea transplant. I remember finding out and getting panic attack in the office, having to numb myself with Xanax when I got home so I could fall asleep. This had always been my fear, what I was trying to always prevent. It made me feel so trapped to this disease. I am still recovering from the transplant. I've been out of work for a month now, I couldn't work with corneal hydrops and now I'm still waiting for clearance to return. I've been really depressed this summer, it's been a hard mental battle. I've had to alter my travel plans, life plans of moving to a new city, and sit in isolation healing because I'm terrified of getting covid during my recovery. This is a pain and a struggle that's hard for most people to understand. Mostly it does unnoticed by other people. I am angry, I am sad, sometimes I am hopeless. However, I know that all I can do is ride the wave. I pray that one day it stabilizes. I pray that this transplant is a positive experience, that it lasts for as long as possible. Day by day, that's how I have to think about it, or else I easily start crying and get overwhelmed. However, I will say keratoconus has never stopped me from pursuing my goals. I have traveled many places and done backpacking trips in South America and Europe. I have studied and pursed academics taking it one day at a time, I think having to sit close to the front of the class to see the board helped me graduate with high honors. I have continued reading even during recovery periods by switching to audiobooks. Driving a car can sometimes be hard when I have periods of complications so I try to live in a city or neighborhood where I can walk to most places, this helps me always keep independence. It's hard, there are definitely moments when I feel so depressed. I just try to remind myself of all the things I've been able to do in life, I try to not even think about the future too much because all I can do is make sure I am doing everything I am in the present moment. I am 26...I'm feeling a little exhausted by the work, but I'm not ready to give up. ",1
11440,"I don't know which studies exactly she has read, but CXL has been in practice here in Germany for I think almost 20 years. Of course, that's not long term enough to know if it will hold ""forever"", but still pretty close. As far as my doctors told me most (70%) have had no progression within 10 years, and in the rest a second procedure worked almost always. The only studies I know of are in German sadly. [This one](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00347-019-00982-w) has a summary in English, came out last year and was done at my home university on a 100 patients over 10 years.

Concerning the procedure itself: I was really nervous, but it wasn't actually that bad. Your eyes are numbed, so you don't really feel a thing, although seeing how the surgeon scrapes off your epithel and having to stare into a UV lamp feels a bit weird. Regarding the aftercare: I was in quite a bit of pain and very light-sensitive for about 3 days, so I took some regular painkillers (ibuprofen) and mostly just laid in my room with the blinds drawn. My parents helped me with putting the prescribed drops in my eyes. After that I was basically functional again, although still quite light-sensitive and with bad vision on my left eye. I wore an eyepatch for about a week, sunglasses afterwards. After a month my vision was almost completely recovered. A week of time-off, maybe two would make sense. ",0

11446,"Dear fellow Redditors, I have just been to two different optomologist who gave me two quite different measurements: \------- The first one: Right eye: -0.25,-1,50, 5 Left eye: -0,5, -3.0, 165 \------- The second one: Right eye: -0.25,-1,50, 5 Left eye: -0.25, -2.0, 165 \------- The second doctor was fully aware of the measurements by the first one. He still set the cylinder to -2.0 as this is my current prescription, and he said it's not worth the trouble to adjust to a different cylinder and that I would never notice the change in real life even if I got used to a higher cylinder. Now I know that my left eye has gotten worse from my current prescription. For example, if I cover my left eye while writing this post I can read it all normally, but if I cover my right eye it's all a blur and I might be able to read a few sentences with a lot of straining and some guesses. The solution here is obvious: I'll go to a third optomologist and just look at my left eye for cylinders in the range of -2.0 to -3.0 and then decide. My condition is that I can read Reddit post with my phone 15-20cm away haha. The other question I have is about lenses. After a bunch of research online, I've pretty much settled on Hoya. The safest option is Nulux identity V+, either 1.6 or 1.67 cut (I don't really see the need for the 1.67). Now my only worry is that I'm a computational physicist which means I spend around 9 hours a day behind a computer. So the Hoya Sync seems quite attractive. The only problem is that I don't know how the lens will react, as I use a PC most of the time, with the screen around 40cm from my face and completely leveled with my hight (I look at it directly through the center of the lens) unless I move my eyes to the corners of the screen, but then I have no idea how the lens will react. When I'm not using the PC I use my laptop holding it in my lap, so I'm definitely looking down (around the 30-40cm) from my eyes, or I use my phone again definitely looking down around 10-15cm from my eye. Now I really don't know what to do here. If I go with the V+ nothing can go wrong... But if I pick the sync lenses, my eyes can get massive relaxation, or my vision gets really screwed.

Sometimes I wake up in the mornings with a dry and bloodshot eye, as well as foggy and blurry vision. My left eyelid twitches frequently, especially during and after workouts, i.e. heavy lifting. It seems as though aging, bodybuilding, and wearing (colored) contact lens have all exacerbated this ailment. Next Friday, I have a consultation with my ophthalmologist who will likely refer me to an oculoplastic surgeon. Looking at my MRD, does my ptosis repair seem more like a candidate for the MÃ¼ller muscle-conjunctival resection (internal technique) or the external technique? I worry about scarring and hoping that I'm taking care of this early enough to remedy from the inside.

11448,This explains it so well haha. I have a friend that says my eye got used to the new lense and now I'm gonna be more reliant on them. He's kinda into end myopia but then again himself is only at -.50 and claims he is at plano after eye exercise. ,0
11449,"About age 20 for me, I believe. It stabilized at around -10.50. I can't recall how suddenly it stabilized, since I wasn't really paying attention to my Rx numbers at that age. That said, it's not unusual for it to continue creeping up into your mid-20s. Almost always it stabilizes by mid/late 20s. Our 30s are a pretty boring decade for eyes (unless you get degenerative myopia or something like that). ",0
11450,"He means lenses in general and suggested Lasik when my sight will be stable. My situation is not tragic at all, I mean I suffered from dry eye syndrome for two months and having them on was not comfy at all, so I automatically quit. Yesterday he noticed it (he said viral but couldn't be sure if it was adenovirus) and saw like 4 microscopic dots per eye (similar to dust on screen) that were already recovering. I get that I have to stop for one year, I will follow it, but for life it seems a lot, I'm 24. The rest of the eye health was perfect. ",1

11452,"Hi. I recently (26th January 2020) had an accident while playing Badminton. My partner blew racket which directly hit me on the eye ball. My eyelids were possibly closed since I have scratches on eye lid. I was taken to ER where they flushed my eye and did facial CT scan snd ruled out optic nerve injury or orbital fracture. They released me after IV painkillers and asked to follow up with an Optometrist. I followed up with with the Optometrist the next day. He performed slit lamp test and noted blood inside my eye. To check if the the retina is not detached he performed ultrasound and found retina was intact. Further the diagnosis included 1) hyphema (around grade 1) 2) vitreous Hemorrhage 3) suspectible Berlins Edema 4) Spinchter Tear ( Traumatic Mydriasis) I was put on Oral Steroid ( Wysolone 60 mg/day) and Prednisolone Eye Drops 6 times a day along with anitbiotic drops and Homatropine drops. Im also sleeping elevated as much as possible. It has been 10 days and my vision is still extremely blurry and hazy. (6/60 as per the test). The doctor says the blurriness is due to blood and trauma. Im 25, healthy, non-diabetic male without any other health issues. I'm extremely tensed for my vision. Ive been through many online research papers and trauma cases and it redirects that patience is the best healer. There are some questions which I couldnt ask my doctor. It be highly grateful if someone help me with these questions 1) is the blurry vision ( feels like looking through a frosted magnifying glass) due to the blood inside vitreous, anterior chamber? 2) are there any risk of retinal detachment in performing daliy activities ( a bit of walk, moving around )? 3) For how long should I expect my vision to return? Any input will help me fight this. TIA. ",1

11454,"I don't even know what the symptoms of sinusitis are, thought they were primarily connected to the nose? Anyway, I never had them, or rather, I only had this pain in the eye that I never personally linked to sinus problems. I am 31 and never been diagnosed with sinusitis. Being the pain located in the eye, I kept visiting ophtalmologists that kept saying that all was OK, only the last one asked to have an MRI done which showed nothing stricly eye-related, but this ethmoidal cyst. So he referred me to an ENT surgeon that offered removal, but he didn't seem entirely sure that this is actually causing my pain. He didn't mention sinusitis either. He said that those cyst in this location can indeed sometime cause orbital pain and headache but, given my history of strabismus surgery (which involves cutting of muscles and, possibly, small nerves in them) he cannot guarantee that there isn't something else going on in my case. So I am bouncing between ENT and opthalmologist without having a clear answer. The cyst is there so I think I will have it removed, he didn't offered any medical treatments prior to surgery. Do you think I should see if another ENT feels that something non-surgical can be done about this cyst, even if there was no talking of chronic sinusitis? Thanks a lot and happy Christmas! ",1

11458,"that's probably your astigmatism axis - there are some numbers you aren't remembering that are the strength of your prescription If it's been 10 years since you've seen an optometrist, your prescription is likely to have changed some anyways. You'll have to go to get a prescription. ",0
11459,"We don't really care too much what your vision is without glasses. We mostly care what you can see with glasses. A lot of people have a prescription, and your prescription usually stabilizes in about your mid twenties so that shouldn't be too much of a factor. If even with your best glasses you aren't 20/20 that's a different problem. ",0
11460,"I am 15M with myopia of -3D in both eyes. Astigmatism has increased to 1.25 in my right eye and 0.75 in my left. These were the results of my recent eye exam (1.5 weeks ago). I started noticing lines coming out of bright lights and a VIBGYOR hue around the flashlight on my phone. When I asked my father about this, he said that this was normal, as he has astigmatism with presbyopia. The ophthalmologist did not state anything nor did the optometrist. I was given a small brochure on how to use computers and Sodium Hyaluronate eye drops. I haven't noticed anything besides this. What should I do? Should I get examined at a different place? I haven't gotten new glasses yet but this is stuff without glasses. ",1
11461,"Hi, I went to the dr because i had an eye twitch for 2 weeks. I have INSANELY high health anxiety, which means I always think anything wrong with me is going to be worst case scenario. So, the dr said ""the pressure in your eyes was a little high but everything looks normal and it was probably because of holding your breath during the reading""<U+009D>. He didn't tell me how high it was or to follow up, etc. From what I'm reading, shouldn't I at least go back soon to make sure it was a mistake? (Any relevant info, I'm 39, obese(which I've read can effect IOP?) female, no history of glaucoma in my family). ",1
11462,"Most likely thing you have is dry eyes. Focused activity line computer work, tv, driving, reading... all contribute to dry eye because your brain forgets to blink. This allows the surface of the eye to dry out and become irregular. This is what causes the blurry vision. I'd recommend a few things. First, use artificial tears on a regular basis 4 times per day, even if you don't think you need it. This will help keep the surface regular. Second is to use the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break by looking 20 feet away. This helps break up your tasks and reminds you to blink. The recent quarantine with increased computer time (and decreased sleep) have likely made it worse. As far as amblyopia (sounds like this is what you're describing as your right eye not seeing as well as your left), there is likely little more that can be done to improve the blurry vision. Amblyopia is a poor communication between the eye and the brain. The eyes have to learn how to talk to the brain when you're a child. There are many things that can cause poor communication between the eye and the brain (i.e. different glasses prescription between the eyes, one eye having more astigmatism than the other, cataract in one eye, eyelid drooping in one eye...). If this isn't corrected, the brain and eye lose the ability to learn how to communicate and that blur becomes permanent. Kids who wear patches are being treated for amblyopia by covering their good eye and forcing their bad eye to learn that communication. After the age of about 12-16, that period that the eye and brain can learn to talk is mostly over. There are some studies showing there may be some benefit to amblyopia treatment in certain types of people up into their mid teens (usually people who've never had any amblyopia treatment, and the later the amblyopia treatment starts, the less improvement can be expected). LASIK doesn't affect amblyopia. You can think of LASIK as getting your glasses prescription lasered into your cornea. It can't sharpen the vision in the amblyopic eye because the communication from eye to brain simply isn't there. Another way to think about it is the eye being a camera that is connected to a computer via a cable. The cable is the optic nerve and the computer is the brain. Amblyopia causes a problem in the computer itself. So everything else in the system looks normal but it still produces a blurry picture. You could put glasses or contacts on the camera, you could even do lasik on the camera, but there's still a processing problem causing the blurry vision. It doesn't mean you can't have LASIK but it does mean your bear vision after the procedure is still limited. ",0
11463,"I'm not a doctor but a fellow sufferer of 15 years, and I've tried pretty much everything under the sun. 5 years ago I was introduced to daily warm compress and eyelid hygiene, a routine I've tweaked and perfected for myself over the years.

11467,"There's a lot to digest and I found the first year to be the hardest on me mentally... trying to process it all. On top of it, there's isn't a TON of info about Sjogren's out there versus other autoimmune diseases. I encourage you to continue to read more about it and be patient with the journey of learning a lot of new information. I do have some advice from a very personal perspective: It's great that you don't have dry eyes or mouth symptoms. However, I highly recommend protecting your teeth now in case you do develop dry mouth. For me, my dry mouth started young - around age 6 - and was so slow to develop over time. I never really thought I had dry mouth - it was just the way it was for me - I thought I was like everyone else. I got diagnosed at age 26 after years and years of dental issues that I might have been able to slow down. Today, I use an electric toothbrush, I brush at least twice a day, I floss, and I use a high fluoride toothpaste at night (it's prescription only - you don't rinse after it). You can also use a fluoride mouthwash at night - I mix it up depending on how I feel. I also always get the fluoride treatment at the dentist. My dentist is also sweet enough to send me home with an extra fluoride treatment for me to do in between visits. I have had so many cavities worked on and have needed to have two teeth pulled. Nowadays when I go in, I get complimented on how well I take care of my teeth and gums. I still need work every now and then but I have been able to slow down the progression of the spots they are watching. I know it sucks and there's a lot to unpack but you will start to make more sense of it all over the next year. ",0

While it's obviously your decision to discontinue that type of treatment (assuming you're over 18), your parents weren't just trying hocus pocus to make your eyes better. I understand your frustration though. Since I don't actually do Ortho-k myself, I've heard of other docs giving the patient progressively stronger daily contact lenses that they use during the process.

11474,"Shouldnt it be on your receipt? No matter. No, I went to a contact lens fitter, so he had all 10 or so brands fitting kits to choose from. We tried about 6 brands 'blanks', scanning each one, before we decided what would work. All blanks are a ""normal"" edge profile, so I could feel them all, but the one i could feel least was the sign we needed that a steep edge would hide the lens for me. I have extra sensitive lids. No, edge design has zero effect on your visual clarity. So many folks fit RoseK, i recon they're the worst feeling thing... odds are its what you have. Ive also heard of tons of 'specialists' having only 1 or 2 brands. Id almost guarantee its a brand-deal they have going on, or a lack of education (as each new brand, is fitted slightly differently). Im never impressed when I hear patients had to just take what they were given without being presented options. Its not like the benefits are hard to explain about each brand. And even easier to feel for the patient, because they're trying the damn things on! Haha. So many lazy 'specialists' out there I swear... USA seems to have it the worst.

My gut health seriously deteriorated and I had the worst flare up, lasted for months. I quit veganism and got some improvement right away. I now realize the vegan diet is extremely inflammatory due to its high lectin content and very poor sources of omega 3 which are absolutely necessary (and anti-inflammatory) coupled with lots of omega 6 (they're inflammatory). If you insist on staying vegan, do yourself a favor and t least take an omega 3 supplement. https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gqynxw/the-fatal-flaw-of-the-vegan-diet Late stage veganism is a thing, and there are a lot of people out there who felt great until the 3, 4, 7 year and then things went downhill fast.

She now rides a bike https://www.amazon.com/Wahls-Protocol-Autoimmune-Conditions-Principles/dp/1583335544 Their approaches are quite similar. Remove gluten, milk, grains, legumes, nuts and seeds (at first anyway, some people can reintroduce some nuts or legumes here and there), and eat mostly vegetables, fruit, meat, fish.

11479,It was worth it. I was 33 at the time but I wish I had done it sooner. I never really thought about it but I was non compliant with my contact lenses and needed to find an alternative which kind of happened to fall in my lap. Because of my high script my surgeon over corrected with 20% which is why I started off with a +1 or something. I also had to use the drops for 4 months instead of 1 month like most other people which was inconvenient but worth it. The one eye drop suppresses your eyes immune system which then meant that the eye healed slower but more effectively giving me better long term results. I couldn't see brad pitt infront of me without specs/lenses before. Immediately afterwards (as in the recovery room) I was able to see the wall clock and see that it was 8:30am. I had 20/20 vision the very next day. Due to the over correction which was on purpose I struggled with near work for a bit but that wasn't for long. I have always been light sensitive which made working on a PC a pain in the ass but nothing a pair of tinted +0.50 readers couldn't help with. I also struggled with some intermittent double vision. That was a convergence issue due to my brain needed to start accepting what i saw as well. I've had poor vision since I was 10. Once I was on holiday a few month later and away from my PC that disappeared. I've never really struggled with dry eyes so that was never an issue and I have a pair of specs with an arc on for driving at night but I otherwise I'm unaided unless I'm infront on the PC looking at excel spreadsheets for hours at end.

I was most nervous for the removal of the epithelium, but honestly that was the easiest part. Right after the procedure I was in pretty serious pain. Before I got the procedure done I swore I wasn't going to take any heavy pain killers, I was wrong. The next day pain wasn't as bad, light sensitivity was the worst part. I kind of felt like a vampire running away from all the lights. Icing my eyes has been the biggest savior. Today I am able to sit in dim lighting and be on my phone which is an upgrade. I have some slight burning in my eyes but nothing too bad. The worst part of it all is the boredom and the sleeping goggles they gave me.(which i have now replaced with sunglasses) My vision is pretty bad as even writing this I can barely see my phone screen.

It's not really that noticeable on objects that aren't glowing or bright. **The only thing that I want to know:** Is this something that would get worse if I don't get it looked at? In my 19 years of seeing like this it hasn't gotten worse. ",0
11484,"Since this post might be a little long I put a TLDR at the bottom. Some background: I have a really high prescription (10). I am in college away from home, so two weeks ago I went to an ophthalmologist to get a dilated exam to check on my retinas and get my yearly checkup. I wanted to get this appointment specifically with an ophthalmologist rather than an optometrist since I haven't noticed a significant change in vision (prescription wise) and since its been a few years since I was dilated. My last appointment before lockdown only did some imaging tests (I think an OCT), and I remember I wasn't dilated. I am well aware of the risks of my high prescription and know the general symptoms to look out for (new floaters, flashes, dark curtain) if I need to drop everything and see an eye doctor. I have had floaters since I was 12. Now here goes - I get flashes in the exact same spots, in both eyes, when I move them rapidly, particularly against bright white backgrounds. I was under the impression that flashes due to tears/detachments happen regardless of eye movement, and they are usually severe and apparent. I didn't know what I was seeing was ""flashes"" until I moved my eyes rapidly with the intent of seeing them, and compared this to a what I've been reading. Well, now I can't UN-see them. I notice them much more often now, but still ONLY with rapid eye movements in bright settings. This was a major reason for the appointment. I am fairly certain I have been ""seeing"" these flashes for a few years. Anyhow, here's how the appointment went. He did the visual tests for my prescription and only raised my prescription up a touch (after a ~~little~~ scare as I had never seen plus cylinder notation before), which was a little bit of a relief suggesting my prescription might be starting to stable out. I talked to him about the flashes, so he dilated my eyes, used a slit lamp, and in a separate test I remember him looking around in my eye, having me look all the way up, left, right, down, through a handheld bright light. He said my retina looked healthy, and that the flashes are likely due to the vitreous fluid tugging on my retina, which can be triggered by the rapid eye movement. He gave me my new prescription and sent me on my way. I lurk here and on similar subreddits, and have read some comments about the how direct ophthalmoscopy is limited in observing the periphery, versus say indirect ophthalmoscopy. I've also read some scare stories about tests like this missing tears in the far periphery which then progress into detachments. Which, of course, gets me concerned. I am planning on getting another appointment with my regular optometrist when I get back home in a month anyway. So, my questions are: Is direct ophthalmoscopy typically sufficient for identifying tears, holes, or the like? I know indirect ophthalmoscopy is generally better. Is it urgent that I find a new appointment immediately with another eye doctor in town and get a more thorough test, or should I keep the one I have in a month? When I have my new appointment, what kinds of tests, if any, should I ask for? Specific imaging? Sorry about the length, and I apologize if questions like this aren't appropriate on this subreddit, but thank you for your help. TLDR: High prescription. Seen flashes for a few years. Went to see an ophthalmologist very recently. Doctor said I'm fine and attributed them to vitreous. Is direct ophthalmoscopy sufficient in finding tears, and would it behoove me to get a second opinion urgently vs in a month? ",0
11485,I had to have one last July (was 22) its a transplant so there can always be complications but as long as you take care of it after you should be fine. (You do feel like shit for the first few days after) The only shitty part was not being able to use my rgp lense in my left eye for the past year while its healed so its annoying to predominantly use one eye to drive and stuff but as long as your positive and proactive in youre eye care then the chances of any complications should be minimal.

It is a 1+ or +1 I don't really remember which and I'm not even sure what that means. I am worried and concerned as to why I have this so early. Is it possible I was born with it? No other eye doctor has mentioned it to me. Maybe they didn't think it was worth mentioning? Could it have been caused by trauma? I've had some corneal abrasions and recently was punched in the eye by my baby's head. Went to the doc for that, said my eye was fine... could the cataract possibly not been formed yet and now it is? Could being punched in the eye by my baby's head cause a cataract? I even asked the doctor if it was blunt force trauma when my eye got punched by my baby's head, he said no. The doctor I saw today said it could be genetics. He also said he didn't think I needed the surgery right now and just acted like it wasn't much of anything. I need support and maybe even some answers. What can I ask my doctor on the next visit so I can know more about what's going on? Can he tell me what kind of cataract it is?

11489,"1.67 and 1.74 have nearly the same Abbe value (about 32-33), so unfortunately the amount of chromatic aberration will be the same. Your best bet are lenses with high Abbe values (the higher the value, the less chromatic aberration). CR-39 and Crown glass are your best bet.. but the lenses will be thicker. To reduce thickness with these lenses, it would be best for you to change frames. You need a frame as small and circular as possible, with your pupil at the center of the frame eyewire. This will reduce the amount of thickness at the sides of the lenses. ",0

I got lasik about 6 years ago because my RX had been stable for a few years and it worked great for a while but my eyes were super dry and uncomfortable for over a year. My eyes started going again a couple years ago and I don't think I want another lasik procedure because I don't want to go thru that dryness again but the blurryness is back. Anyway, the moral to my story here is that you should wait till your vision stabilizes to get lasik, and even then it's not a *guarantee* that it'll be a permanent fix. All that said, I'm not unhappy that I did it. It was great to go those years without needing corrective lenses. And I may go back for an enhancement at some point.

11499,"Hello, I am no eye professional so take what I say with a grain of salt . I was diagnosed with the same thing as you, which judging on your prescription of plus is hyperopia. The doctor told me as well to use glasses, despite the fact of me telling the doc I could see just fine without them. Nonetheless I went and got glasses. Same prescription as you +0.50 on both eyes with very little astigmatism on the left eye instead the right like yours. I tried to wear them whenever I was doing close up work and the glasses were very uncomfortable , they told me it was normal it was the adjusting period so I would wear them for that. However I noticed that my eyes just couldn't stand the glasses and rejected them heavily (this is somewhat common with hyperopes i have heard). However I still wore them and it never improved, so I stopped wearing them. I went for a second opinion and the other doctor didn't find anything. Now I'm going for a 3rd and final opinion. From my experience and from what I have heard ,a +0.50 is a very small prescription that rarely needs glasses full time due to the accommodation muscles in your eyes( like I said no professional so take it with a grain of salt). With time though from what I have seen of other hyperopes, it does get worse but its a slow progression that happens in years. When you hit your 40s you will probably lose your far sight as presbyopia kicks in, this is very normal though most people get this at that age. The downside of this is that there's barely any research for hyperopia as there is for myopia so the treatments aren't the best. The upside is that it is a slower progression than myopia, (some times). ",0

Dominant eye to see distance, other eye to see near. Or you can always opt for early cataract surgery. Cataracts are your lenses that have hardened/grown in density (which is the reason why people need readers at age 40). When you undergo cataract surgery, a synthetic lens is inserted in your eyes, and basically you can get bifocal lenses implanted (so you have permanent bifocals in your vision to put it simply. This would eliminate your need for glasses). Also, definitely have to add this disclaimer: everyone's eyes develop differently. You may not need reading glasses until you're 50, like my mom! ",0

After visiting the professional for the first time she took topography and asked me to check back in 6 months to determine if I need CXL. My left eye is 20/20 and my right eye is 20/30 (being that said for right eye, its not normal 20/30 as most of u with this condition would know). I was afraid what if my good eye go bad, and still took a leap of faith and went for further studies at age of 24. Fast forward to year 29, and I have had had almost yearly topographies, and it has been almost same since. And as I got used to living with one good and one little bad eyes, my life went back to normal. Now I use simple glasses everywhere (I tried RPGs when I was 25, it gave clear vision, but I couldn't stand the irritation, and went back to glasses as my left is still 20/20).

And now I am talking to this girl, whom I like and she also likes me.

The worries which I had in first 4 months of the diagnosis, which I had left in back of my mind and started to live normal life, came back with a rush. Reality of struggle with Keratoconus came back to light and now I am unsure because of fear of losing her to tell her this. I am not sure what I should do. I don't know how serious this disease could be. I don't know if I don't tell her now, and letter during regular check ups when she will come to know about it, how would she take it. I know few possible answers: - I should have declared it in the beginning (as my life went back to normal, I myself didn't feel that it was a big deal until this realization) - If she loves me, she will stick around (it's arranged marriage, and people do abandonment it very easily unlike when they are in love) Please advise what is the practical thing to do here. Very few people close to me know about this (as I don't want any sympathy, and its private) and they suggest its not a big deal like AIDS or cancer, and there is no need to go and tell her as if this is a big deal.

11522,"Hello, Up until around 22 years every visit at an optometrist ended up with good results, used to go there just for a yearly routine check up. After i got back from a study abroad program in London, where i had an accident, broke my nose during a basketball game, i got a little bit depressed from this accident and started smoking weed and also using visine almost every day to get rid of bloodshot eyes. I visited the local optometrist and i was told by her that my pressure was around 25/26 at the time (puff test). At the time i ignored it and thought something was wrong with the machine. Fast forward 5 years later to the present point i go to optometrist and was told that my pressure was 26/27 and 24/25 another time. I got sent to a glaucoma specialist where after several tests i was told the puff pressure test overestimates my pressure since i have a thick cornea and after they did a golden standard eye pressure test it ended up being 20/23. I was told everything in my eyes looks healthy after they performed other glaucoma suspect testing. I was there for a good 2 hours doing a bunch of glaucoma tests. The specialist did not prescribe any medications and told me i have nothing to worry about for now but i have to go there once a year to do a routine check up. That was a happy moment for me but i am stil a little paranoid and trying to find potential reasons as why this happened to me? prior to 22 years old, even with the puff test the pressure was normal i am assuming since nothing alarming was mentioned to me during my yearly routine check ups. Could it be because of i broke my nose and this trauma caused it? could it be my rhinoplasty surgery causing this elevated pressure? Could it be the visine usage? By the way from what i remember i only used visine for like 3-4 months once a day or twice a day sometimes and then when i found out about rebound hyperemia i stopped. Or could this elevated pressure just naturally happening to me? I do not have anyone in my family tree with this issue? Please some help here would be much appreciated.

I'm a teacher, and have always spent part of my day in front of a computer, but with Covid it became all day. My right eye always seemed to be worse (which is why all the pictures below are of my right eye) and that is pretty status quo. If I'm having ear problems, my right ear is always the worst. I have intermittent pain in my right shoulder that I used to assume was some arthritis/inflammation from playing drums, but it seems to come and go in conjunction with my right ear and/or right eye inflammation. There are linked pictures below. It probably started closer to February but March is the earliest picture I kept. So around the end of May, I had both eye inflammation and ear inflammation. My right ear felt like it was being stabbed periodically, and my eyes had developed light sensitivity. (The May 31st picture). I figured a sinus infection with maybe an eye infection as well. Also had a UTI. No sinus pressure, though. Went to Urgent Care. He said he didn't think the eyes were infected, but figured the inflammation was due to a sinus infection. Gave me steroids and antibiotics. I stopped wearing contacts (actually stopped a few days before that). The eyes seemed to do well with the steroids and glasses. Once the steroids were done after five days, I tried contacts again (brand new pair) and regretted it within a few hours. Went to an optometrist and she said they were infected. Gave me antibiotics and steroid eyedrops. No contact usage. After a week I went for a checkup and they recommended I taper off the eyedrops and could start wearing contacts again once I got to two drops a day. I waited until I completely finished tapering off the drops. That was about two or so weeks ago. I used to wear them about 14 - 16 hours a day. I'd take them off at night and switch to glasses when I watched TV/played video games and then wouldn't use them until I left for work the next day. Now, since the infection, I actually wear them as little as possible. Maybe 6-7 hours a day or less. Mainly when I go out, because I hate how I look with my glasses. They're like... coke bottle thick. I never slept overnight with them. I do periodically fall asleep in them for an hour or so. Never swim in them/shower in them. Wash my hands before handling them, use a new contact case every time I put in a new pair, which is monthly.

My other eye is -0.5. I'm just wondering if anyone has had any experience like this before, or if this is normal? When I did wear glasses, the lense on my lazy eye was always very thick and people would point it out to me a lot, so it feels weird for my prescription now to be essentially just a plain lense with no correction on that eye.

What truly is alarming is how bad this ghosting progressed in a manner of weeks. I know my right eye has been much weaker than my left eye for over 3 years so I feel like ive had it that long. The scary thing is, it has only taken 2 months for me to not be able to read close screens. **I believe it has to do with stronger prescription sunglasses given to me by the same Dr.** after I was diagnosed. What frustrates me the most is he even said I wouldnt even suggest stronger prescription glasses because it might mess with your brain. I respected that but I then needed an updated prescription to get sunglasses. Even if I needed lenses, I needed something to help me see till then. I explained in an email that although he suggested not increasing it I still needed a newly signed one even if it was my old prescription, but he gave me the stronger one. I kind of noticed that whenever I used my sunglasses it got worse but now i'm sure after a sunny week, my ghosting has been worse than ever. Sorry for the tangent but I think it needs to be explained better in this subreddit. If you arent experiencing ghosting yet, maybe try to beat it. **I didn't realize it can get to a point where you Always need your contacts to read , in a manner of weeks.** So if you can still read your cellphone without contact lenses, maybe try to be proactive and visit many doctors. Now I think I might never be able to read well without contacts IN and that might make a huge difference in quality of life. I have that follow up appointment on Tuesday and im not sure why im even going, I know I need CXL now. **If anyone has suggestions for a Laser surgeon in NYC, it would be much appreciated **. ",1

11538,"Ophthalmologist here. First, let me say that no licensed medical practitioner is going to give a pregnant woman medical advice over the internet--the potential medicolegal exposure is simply too great. So bearing in mind that I'm speaking in general terms, and am neither rendering a diagnosis nor making recommendations to you: Brief flashing lights in the periphery of one eye are a classic manifestation of *vitreoretinal traction*, a condition wherein the jelly inside the back of the eye (the *vitreous*) is tugging on the neurosensory retina, usually in a far-peripheral location. The physical stimulation imparted to the retina by the tugging stimulates the photoreceptors, which do what photoreceptors do--they send a signal back to the brain, which interprets that signal as light flashes. By far, the #1 risk factor for VR traction is age. Eyes 60 or so undergo changes that can lead to VR traction. In younger adults, severe diabetic retinopathy is probably the most common cause. High myopia (in the -10D range) is a risk factor in young adults as well, as is a history of significant ocular trauma. Is there a relationship between VR traction and pregnancy? Tangentially, yes. As mentioned, severe diabetic retinopathy can produce it. Because pregnancy can accelerate diabetes, it is not unheard of for diabetic mothers to experience a significant worsening of diabetic retinopathy that culminates in VR traction. (That said: If a pregnant woman is getting good prenatal care and has never tested positive for diabetes, in the latter stages of pregnancy she is **not** going to suddenly get diabetes so bad that she develops VR traction.)

Now I understand there are different types of eye implants and different types eye/vision impairments so experiences will vary, but I've noticed that articles I've read on the internet about 1-2 years ago with a colleague of mine (we were researching new markets) either no longer exist and some testimonials and interviews with people who had horrible experiences can no longer be found? I don't have a source nor do I remember all of the research word for word, but the jist of one was 4 of the 5 (this number could be wrong) test patients after 24 hours experienced great discomfort and intense nightmare/lucid dreaming. Some felt extremely off balance, experiencing vertigo like symptoms and dizziness. Headachesr and migraines were also common. Another interesting note was that the patients preferred to use their eyes only when stationary, close their eyes when moving and look again once stopped. Other patients outside of this test group also shared similar experiences. When researching this stuff back then I wasn't even doing a deep dive into google, maybe three pages in max, now I can't find anything anywhere. All testimonials and patient interviews now sound extremely positive and talk how it changed their life. Which is great, maybe the tech advanced ten fold over the last year.

The surgery was a success however there is no vision, just the gray cloud.

11543,"Good point. I do not remember if she said she did expression after the IPL or not. She is doing the IPL on the lids, not just the facial area. Actually, she just said we will look at the TearCare after the set of 4 IPL is complete in 4 months and discounted the value of meibomian gland probing talking about the downsides of that procedure. Yes, I looked at the images taken from the meibomian glands the day of our visit and she pointed out the strengths and weaknesses in them. Actually it looks better than the ones I did with the other doctor 5 years ago. She also plucked 4 eyelashes in several areas putting them under a microscope saying as she looked in front of me that the demodex did not look too bad. Might have been some improvement from the efforts so far with the glans and the demodex. I have read that Lipiflow does sometimes show improvement in getting some of the glands moving again that were not before. I will see about it next week on the expression aspect since the first session is next Tuesday. I have been operating on the assumption that I want to arrest the further deterioration in the glands and if possible reverse the damage thus I am erring in the direction of too much. Additionally, the other assumption I have is to prevent the next flare-up that might occur instead of waiting for the next flare up to happen then react. My doctor #2 does her eyes with Lipiflow every year and she is in her mid to late thirties I figure. My doctor #1 has been asking me if I thought Lipiflow works as she is considering doing it! This doctor #3 has a very thriving practice that includes dry eye as one of her specialties who seems to know her stuff.

When I finally found a shop that quoted me 4-5 working days, the guy doing my eye test advised me that it was extremely unlikely for the lab to do it that quickly and I was looking at 10 working days. I suspect her colleague was quoting me a shorter time frame to close the sale. To make matters worse, finding a frame was extremely difficult. I'm not sure why but all the stores kept telling me they had very few metal frames with spring hinges and the ones that did were expensive $200+ frames which was outside my price range. When I gave up and chose a frame without spring hinges, I was warned that it was too narrow for me and it would be uncomfortable at the temples. I currently wear a pair that is 52-18 and the pair I wanted to buy was 54-16, but was told that the pair I wore had spring hinges which made it more comfortable. I was still about to place an order but was quoted 10 working days to get the lenses made and was advised not to proceed with the order if that was a problem for me.

At this point, it was past 9pm and all the other optical stores had closed for the day.

I did an eye test a year ago that showed my left had a cylinder of -4.50 and the eye test I did today showed my left had a cylinder of -3.75.

(like god who knew people didn't get severe bladder spasms and bouts of UTI symptoms without a UTI, s/o 15 years of untreated interstitial cystitis). I feel like I don't even know what the look into at this point because I have no idea what is normal but now that I can get my life and health (somewhat) under control I want to. Could y'all share any other chronic conditions that you have in addition to Sjogren's? Like anything that has an autoimmune origin. I just want to check out what is seen with sjogren's in other people so that I can check it out and if I have been thinking its normal for years, go and get some more answers. I don't even know where to start. I go to medical school in a year and damn it I am going to stop being the chronically ill human. ",1

11577,"Hello! So I'm 21 year old male, and I really struggle from all of these things. Right now i wear started to wear contacts since I think yesterday, and the starburst and all of the stuff still didn't disappear. With glasses I still see everything, but it's less annoying and starbursts are smaller. Without glasses or contacts all of those are bigger, so I think its due to my prescription. My eye exam results are OD: -4.0; -2.25 x 4 and OS -4.5; -3.25 x 167 and my contact lense perscription OD -3.25; -1.75 x 0 and OS -3.5; -1.75 x 170.

At your age I'd wait 4 months and check for progression because you may not need CXL. You might need a second scan showing progression for insurance coverage too. If there is no progression at 4 months, then just continue with ""watchful waiting"" exams at the intervals recommended by your doctor. Best wishes for a lot of boring exams! ",0
11580,"Hello, As the title suggests, I am wondering whether it is wise for me to resume playing contact sports. For context, I'm in my mid-twenties and have no health issues. I have never suffered any physical injury to my eye, I'm just severely myopic. In 2014, I had a tear in my left retina which was temporarily confined with laser photocoagulation. In 2017, this developed into a retinal detachment with multiple breaks. I had another round of laser treatment that was unsuccessful, and then emergency surgery with a vitrectomy, endolaser treatment, scleral buckles, and a pneumatic retinopexy (according to my medical record). I lost some vision and a good bit of depth-perception from the detachment, but otherwise, I have healed completely. All further appointments with my opthalmologist in the years that have followed have been without issue. My most recent check-up was this past February. I understand that because of my myopia and background of previous issues I may be susceptible to further problems, but I am wondering if I should allow this to continue to limit my activities? My hand-eye coordination isn't as good as it used to be, but I still would like to get back to playing sports. I would ask my opthalmologist, but he's a no-nonsense type of guy and I think he and my mother would both prefer me to live in a large bubble. I appreciate any feedback!

11586,CXL shouldnt remove any cornea thickness after your epi heals but it has its downsides + every procedure done to your eye is somewhat risky. CXL is not needed if your eye doesnt progress at all which is something that should happen fairly rarely at the age of 40+. ,0

11595,Presbyopia is when the lens starts to loose its ellasticity usually people start to notice it at around 40. Varifocals take away the need to take off your glasses. Thats it. If you find it more convenient then varifocals would be a good choise. There are a lot of different types of lenses to choose from so the frame is most often not an issue. Perhaps go look for frames and then consult your optometrist about different options. ,0

11598,"Hi guys, My RX hasn't changed in the last 9 years. I had always worn contact lenses, but in the last year had to start wearing glasses more frequently due to my eyes drying out/disorientation and extreme tiredness with the contacts in. I had the same pair for those 9 years (again, rarely wore them). The style is dated and the lenses are scratched, so after my optometry appt, I ordered a new pair. My old frames were plastic, rectangular and the lenses fairly thick (-4.75 and -5.0), but not heavy or noticeable to others. These were very comfortable for me. I received my new pair and can't wear them due to disorientation and distortion. I will also see an entire lampshade (if the light is on )in the corner of my glasses, when the light isn't in my peripheral vision. The lenses are thinner and less curved as well. This optometrist changed my axis from 110 to 134, despite me being told my mild astigmatism would have the same numbers (this was a new optometrist). Not sure if that's an issue. These lenses also have nose pads and thus sit farther from my eyes, which I also dislike. The lenses are also much thinner (polycarbonate) and much less curved (my old glasses almost wrap around the outer corners of my eyes , which seems to help). They are also not as wide as my rectangular glasses, so perhaps this is part of the issue. I'm fine with these lenses as long as I don't turn my head or my eyes. Once I do that, it's a dizzying mess. I'm trying to get the same lenses I had before, because while they aren't thin, they're comfortable and the way they look on me doesn't cause me to look bug eyed etc. Any suggestions on what to look for? All I seem to be able to find available with my RX are polycarbonate/high index. I honestly don't know what my old lenses are made from (definitely not glass. I'm leaning towards regular plastic) and without seeing anything else as an option anywhere, I'm a little concerned. Thank you and pardon my ignorance. Nearly 10 yrs behind on lens updates, I guess I should've been updating my frames more often. ",0
11599,"I would go with high index 1.67 if you were my patient. The smaller the frame, the thinner the lenses. High Index lenses are thinnest at the center, so the thickest part will be at the lens edges. If you went with an aviator, or something close to being that large, you would have super thick lenses on the outside. Also, a plastic frame will hide the lens edges much better than a metal frame. Also, avoid poly if you want the least amount of distortion. ",0
11600,"The retina stretches slowly over time as axial myopia progresses. This usually stops progressing in the late teens or early 20's. Once it begins occurring there is no known way to completely stop it until it stops on it's own due to age. It can be slowed with eye drops or special contact lenses. Wearing glasses that are too strong as a child can theoretically worsen myopic progression. But wearing glasses that are too weak or just right does not significantly affect myopic progression (although some data suggests wearing glasses that are just right is better than wearing glasses that are too weak, but the difference is pretty neglible).

So I'm hoping that all means it's just Sjogren's, but when I was looking it up, I was seeing some studies saying that primary Sjogren's doesn't really seem to present as only SSB positive.

11627,"Oh man hope I'm not too late to advise... believe it or not Optometrists usually give rubbish advice when it comes to lens choices. The Tailor made lenses were the priciest varifocals until the recent release of Superdigital AND Superdrive. I will explain this as simply as possible, with all varifocals you have distance vision zone at the top then working down the lens you have computer vision zone (usually arms length) and then near vision zone at the bottom. The more you pay for the varifocal, the less distortion there is on the edges meaning wider field of vision. Superdigital is a new lens that introduces a 4th vision zone between the computer and near zone called ""Digital"" which is designed for when we usually hold phones and tablets etc at around 20-40 cm. From what you have said so far, I actually wouldn't recommend varifocals for your prolonged computer use and would recommend either VDU or occupational lenses. If you have any questions, I'm here to help or if you go instore, as for a Dispensing Optician. ",0
11628,"Even if you have no history of allergies, anyone can develop an allergy to anything at any time in their life, especially during childhood or young adulthood. I know someone who developed a strawberry allergy in her 30s. AFAIK the science behind this isn't fully understood. So you may very well have dust allergies. Your doctor should be able to test for them. Systane Complete and the ones I recommended ultimately are intended to do the same thing, the difference being that Systane Complete contains preservatives, which if abused can cause further dry eye symptoms. Don't use those more than every 4-6 hours. You can absolutely go to town on the ones I linked. I sure did. I was probably putting them in every 30 minutes at one point. Very temporary relief is better than no relief. One final thing I remembered that helped make computer use less painful - install [flux](https://justgetflux.com) and set a fairly aggressive blue-light blocking curve (it's ugly at first but you get used to it, I can't go without it anymore after a few months).

I don't have many issues seeing during the day, but it does feel like my vision is getting a little worse. I know I don't have any vitamin/mineral deficiencies as I've had blood drawn recently. I can't remember the last time I got an eye exam. Most of my family is nearsighted, and my brother is farsighted. I've asked my parents if it's worth getting an eye exam but they just tell me that I had 20/20 vision as a kid and most eye issues are diagnosed in childhood, and the issue is likely because I work in front of a computer. My health insurance plan includes one free eye exam per year. I've been thinking about getting one done since it's been getting harder to see at night, but I don't want to waste a doctor's time if my vision is fine. I'm honestly not sure if I'm having vision issues or if it could be due to anxiety/overthinking things. Should I get an eye exam if there's a chance that's nothing is wrong? ",1
11630,"Hi all, I (35) was recently diagnosed with keratoconus (more extreme in my right eye) after years of blurry vision and uncomfortable contacts and being told it was just astigmatism and getting older. I've worn contacts since 18, so I tried gp lenses in both eyes first, but had trouble getting a good fit in the right eye, and have settled on a soft lens in my left and hybrid in my right. I'd say overall my comfort has increased almost twofold, but my vision doesn't feel quite as sharp as I was hoping it would be. Is this sort of the way of the disease? Is it the case that only surgery will full correct my vision? What makes someone a good (or not good) candidate for surgery? I currently see an optometrist, should I find an opthalmologist? Thanks in advance! ",1
11631,We did it for 20 years in the US. The most important rule is still the same. Don't wear contacts when there's something wrong with the comfort or vision. Many of the problems we had then were solved by throwing the lens away and getting fresh lenses. Many US lenses are made in Europe. Where are you that you can't get stuff mailed to you? ,0

And now its come back. I was kinda skeptical whether it was just a problem with bulbs but i am feeling it everywhere now. So its something up with my eyes. Also i've had a twitching feel in the extreme corner of my left eye since morning. No muscle twitching. Just vision twitching or something when i focus on something without blinking for a few seconds. Its at the corner only.

11636,"I as a new contacts wearer I was given both Acuvue Moist and Clariti brands to try out. After 2 weeks I gave my doc the OK to order me full boxes of Acuvue because overall I liked them better. The Clariti brand actually seemed to be more comfortable on my eyes more quickly after inserting them, but they gave me this weird dizzy feeling like the left and right were a little disoriented to each other (I have a toric lens in my left eye). The Acuvue on the other hand gives me fantastic vision all day, but the first few minutes after putting them in are rough. First of all, the solution that the dailies are in seem to make my eyes burn a bit. Then the lenses themselves seem to scratch and irritate my eyes to the point where I sometimes have to sit in the dark with my eyes closed for 2 minutes because I can't keep them open. After a few minutes things seem fine and then I have zero problems all day with crystal clear vision and I forget they're even there. I'm just trying to figure out why this initial irritation is happening and if I'm doing anything wrong. I mentioned it to the assistant but she just said I can rinse the Acuvue in my bottled solution first if I want, which seems to help a little. My doc examined my eyes after 2 weeks of wearing them and there were no issues, so I'm hopeful my eyes will get used to putting them in sooner or later, but I'm wondering if some initial irritation is normal or something I should be concerned about. I already ordered 90 days worth of Acuvue so I'm stuck with them regardless. ",0

11646,"The question has already been answered but just to add a little detail: There is no number at which you become blind once you hit it. Optometry is part physics part health care. Glasses correction is the physics part of it. As long as there is a focal point on your retina, and as long as the path to it is clear, and as long as the signal can reach your brain from your eyes, it is possible to correct it with glasses. If you are hypermetropic, plus powered, there is a limit to how high a power you will need because the eyeball is only so long. I'm not saying there's a limit to how high we can correct, rather I'm saying there's a limit to how high we'll ever need to correct. So you don't really see people with plus power that goes that high. If you are myopic, negative power, the number needed can get much higher to correct your vision. I've seen as high as -29, and I'm sure others have seen higher. It definitely is a little more difficult to correct vision that high, partially because the higher your correction needs to get the less likely to doctor will have the lenses on hand to neutralize it in an exam. But also because the higher your prescription gets, the more likely other factors such as minification and vertex distance will have a significant impact on your correction. But it is still possible to correct vision that high. As I said as long as there is a focal point and there's a clear path to it and their is signal to the brain then you can correct it with glasses. Some diseases, like cataracts, vitreous hemorrhage, corneal scarring, and others cause the clear tissues that let light into the eye to become cloudy or opaque. Because light can't pass through, no matter how strong or weak your glasses are, that would be considered blindness. Other diseases, like macular degeneration or retina detachment, causes the focal point to be ""crumpled up"" for lack of a better word. That can also cause blindness. And yet other diseases, such as stroke, glaucoma, brain tumors, can affect the optic nerve which connects your eyes to your brain. In this case there's nothing wrong with the eyes but you're still blind because the brain gets no signal. High prescriptions are associated with higher risk of eye diseases. So it's definitely true that if you have a really high prescription you are more likely to go blind, but there's no amount of prescription that guarantees you to go blind. And overall the average risk to any single person of going blind is pretty low And can usually be avoided with routine eye exams. ",0

11648,"From one spouse to another! My wife was diagnosed with SjÃ¸gren and SLE right after we started dating some 20 years ago (we are now 37). She has experienced many of the issues related to these diseases (debilitating fatigue, arthritis, pericarditis, pleuritis, scleritis, severe sicca symtoms with multiple corneal abrasions, deep vein thrombosis and many more). She works full time as a teacher. We live in Norway. I've just rambled down some of the things that are at the top of my head ... **Offload energy thieves** By this I mean do stuff for her that might seem like small things but which can steal energy. Even though your wife doesn't suffer from debilitating fatigue removing some energy thieves probably won't hurt :) \- One of the things I do for my wife is act as a secretary when it comes to doctor's appointments and medications. She asked me early on if this was something I could do for her and it has worked out well. I keep in touch with PCP, rheumatologist, opthalmologist and whoever else needs to be kept in touch with. This is of course something **she** initiated with the different doctors so I can act on her behalf. \- I also make sure she always has enough of her medicines and fill her multi dose blister pack without her needing to worry about it. \- I get up with the kid every morning (he likes to get up around 5-5:30) so she can sleep until 6:30 on weekdays or as long as she wants in the weekends. \- Since I'm up before her every day I make sure her Blephasteam goggles ([https://www.thea-pharmaceuticals.co.uk/products/blephasteam](https://www.thea-pharmaceuticals.co.uk/products/blephasteam)) are ready when she gets up and I try to have breakfast ready. and so on. You get the drift. Do whatever you can to make life easier for her I guess is my point. Happy wife, happy life :) **Research** Learn as much as you can about the disease and keep up-to-date on the newest ***scientifically proven*** treatment options. I bet your wife will be told by friends and colleagues to try alternative treatments X, Y and Z because it worked for someone's aunt's remote relative who had an itch once (at least this happens to my wife on a regular basis and she hates it). Stick to science. My wife told me once that she felt she had more than enough just coping with the diseases and that she had no extra time/energy to research and keep up-to-date. That's my job now. **And finally ... lube, lube and more lube.** Yeah, we always have a huge bottle of lube available. So what? My wife is **really** dry and sex is impossible without lots of lube, however when you find the right type of lube (go water based!) and use plenty of it then you can certainly have a great sex life. And a tip from one man to another: if, in retrospect, you notice that you might not have used enough lube and your penis is sore then I recommend applying a chunk of vaseline for a day or two. That will ease the discomfort and he will be back to business in no time. That was alot of random rambling ... Hopefully some of it is useful :). ",1

Depends wildly on location (rural better), practice type (group or OMD often better), client base (rich better), etc. Sometimes will increase; sometimes will stagnate. If you work for someone, they're unlikely to give you a lot more money each year for no reason. 3. Cities: often have to work part-time in multiple locations. More rural: easier to find single practice. Start making connections and try to find a practice you are interested in before you graduate (although some classmates' plans fell through, which sucks). 4. I never specialized, so dunno. 5. Probably. Unless I could have invested a ton into Bitcoin. 6. Specialize. Glaucoma and diabetes, maybe some macular degeneration. Dry eye. Specialty contact lenses. Pediatrics / vision therapy. Low vision. 7. Not particularly. Will probably approximately grow with the rest of the economy. Although online sales might hurt optical and computerized testing might hurt medical. 8. Depends on what your comparison is. If you see mainly Medicaid patients, a vision plan patient is gold (well, depending on how well Medicaid reimburses; some states it's quite good). If you see mainly rich private-pay patients at $500 an exam, a vision plan patient is crap. 9. Matching what you enjoy about the job to what will get you paid. 10.

For the last several years, there have been times when I was wearing my prescription eye glasses (like if I was cleaning my contact lenses overnight or taking a ""day off"" from wearing them), when I would get a surge of searing pressure-like pain just where my glasses touch my skull above and behind my ears. If I didn't snatch the glasses off my face right away, the pain would intensify and sort of wrap around my skull! And the second I did snatch the glasses off, the pain would quickly fade away and vanish. This continued even after I changed my prescription and got new glasses. Neither pair of glasses is too tight; one pair is actually way too big and barely touches at all, but even the slightest touch can cause the pain. But here's the kicker: it can happen even if my eyes are closed as I put the glasses on and take them off! So I don't think it's a vision thing at all... I think it's some sort of physical pressure point thing, like fibromyalgia, but just in this one very specific spot. It has never happened with sunglasses, but my sunglasses are all much lighter than my eyeglasses. Anyone heard of something like this? ",1
11667,"Hello, Ihave been suffering from really bad eye strain for 4 years now, I am 24 y.o currently I have around 1.75+ D hyperopia and 2.5+D hyperopia with dilated test. I have seen many doctors and tried different prescription glasses but they just wont make me comfortable. I wanted to discuss with someone who also has huperopia and how to deal with it Also any advice other than ""just take a break every 20 min"" is welcom. ",1
11668,"Hi there. I am a 29 year old male. And I have -10 in one eye and -9.5 in another eye with -1.5 astigmatism in one eye and -0.75 astigmatism in another. I am forbidden by the opthalmologist to wear any contact lenses because of some problems with the eye. So I have to wear these thick glasses. The problem is, I cannot do anything while wearing these glasses. I cannot practice martial arts, swim, play cricket or do anything. I am looking for a googles or some other similar implement that I can wear over my glasses so that the goggles can be used in any situation like swimming, martial arts etc. But it should not make me look dorky. The goggles also needs to have sun protection so, either it needs a photosun system (where it darkens with sunlight) or it comes with a clip on sunglasses. I know that powered goggles can be purchased or made, but I live in Bangladesh and I looked around, no such goggles exist. So I have to order them online and therefore they need to be a one-size for all. The goggles cannot therefore be custom made like eyeglasses are. I don't know where else to ask this. So can someone suggest what type of goggles I need to look for? What is the term for such goggles? ",1
11669,"I'm going to try to keep this as brief and relevant as possible, but so far there is a lot to cover. I will try to keep it chronological as well. **January 2010 (17 years of age)** \- optic nerve ""swelling"" noticed on routine exam. MRI done to rule out IIH. MRI was normal, more images taken. Optic disc drusen diagnosed in right eye only. At the time, they were ""buried"" drusen and were not considered significant. Told at the time to monitor yearly by doing a visual field test at each eye exam and self-monitor for changes in color vision. **2010 - 2019** \- I do mostly yearly visits, give or take some months, and receive normal results on my tests. Periodic imaging it taken and drusen is still, as far as anyone told me, normal and not significant. My most recent imaging and test were 2019, which as far as I am aware were normal. Color vision is normal. **2020** \- testing is skipped this year for obvious reasons **Early/mid July 2021 (29 years of age)** \- I start to notice in early July that the vision in my right eye seems off, but not in terms of distance. I cannot quite put my finger on what is off about it, just noted I cannot see as well. In mid-July, I realize that I am not able to see as well in my peripheral vision in the upper nasal portion. I self-test for difference in color vision between two eyes and notice that I am seeing everything in a significantly more warm/orange tone in my right eye than with my left. I call and make an appointment with a new ophthalmologist. **Late July 2021** \- At the new doctor, lots of imaging is done as well as a Humphrey visual field test. The images showing the optic nerve head showed ""very significant"" drusen in the right eye and only a small amount on the left. He estimated that due to how much there is, it is contributing to the loss of peripheral vision to a degree. One of the images (I don't know the name but [this is the type](https://ibb.co/NVLZVdN) of image) showed a lumpy/bumpy appearance, which I understand to be normal with my level of drusen. It shows what looks like some fluid on the right one, which he notes but doesn't think is important. The visual field test showed a significant amount of visual field loss on the nasal side. My last visual field test from 2019 was faxed over from my previous doctor and was completely normal. Due to the progression and the sudden nature of my vision loss, he referred me to a neuroophthalmologist. **Late August 2021** \- I have the appointment with the neuro. More imaging is done as well as another Humphrey visual field test. The imaging returns the same results, but the visual field test showed slight improvement, though my vision was still affected to a degree. My IOP was 23, but my corneas are quite thick, so when adjusting for that it would have been around an 18. She did not believe that there was anything neurological going on and that it is likely loss from the drusen. She think it could potentially be from migraines and suggests an MRI if I'm worried, but she doesn't think one is necessary. I decline an MRI at that time because if she isn't worried, I'm not worried. We make a follow-up appointment for late November to check my visual field again and note any changes or worsening symptoms. **Late August - early October 2021** \- My vision stays about the same for a week or two, but then gets significantly worse. I have tunnel vision in the right eye all day, accompanied by sharp, stabbing pain in the eye. My vision is also now blurred. I notice occasional pain/pressure in the eye as well. The next day, my vision is back to my normal. There is no clear pattern happening, but I have days where my vision is ""normal"" and other days where it's not. I almost immediately start keeping track of symptoms and activities to find any correlation. I make an appointment with me regular eye doctor just to update my prescription, as I believed it had changed and with everything else, that got put to the side at the time. In late August, I cut out caffeine and stopped taking my prescribed Adderall to see if there would by any improvement in symptoms. **Today** \- I go in for my normal eye exam. My prescription is exactly the same, though I mention my symptoms to him, and mentioned today was a ""good vision"" day. He decides to do more imaging, though doesn't really mention why, and takes my IOP which was 22. The imaging shows a choroidal nevus in the right eye, as well as a CHRPE. He mentions that with the symptoms and the fluctuations I've reported, he believes that I should go ahead and have the MRI. He also says that it's possible that the nevus is leaking fluid, which can cause vision loss as well. He does not think that it is being caused by migraines as the other doc suggested. He encourages me to reach out to my neuro doc to see if she can see me any earlier than November 30th and asks that I update him if possible. I reach out via the messaging system and hear back fairly quickly. She does not think an MRI is necessary, but she is willing to order one if I want. She says that it's incredibly unlikely for my nevus to be causing any issues or leaking fluid. She now believes that my vision problems are caused by a combination of ocular migraines and the drusen. She recommends I cut back on caffeine and switch to a different ADHD medication. I have already completely stopped both of those things as of late August. She recommends I start keeping a log of my symptoms and recording my stress levels, caffeine intake, sleep amount and quality, and any high-sodium/high-MSG, dairy, and sugar intake. I write back to let her know that I had cut out caffeine/stimulants all together, and that I had been keeping track of sleeping patterns and quality and found no correlation. I also let her know I have never had any known issues with ocular migraines in the past and asked if it was normal for them to start quite suddenly. She wrote back and mentioned that she still believes it's highly likely to be ocular migraines, and asks me to keep track of the other items as well. She said it's not unheard of for these to begin suddenly. She mentions she will still see me as scheduled on November 30th, but doesn't believe it is neurological in nature and I will likely need to follow up with my regular doc or my PCP. I reach out to my regular doc to let him know that she believes it to be due to migraines and not something neurological, and give him the updates. He says he disagree entirely, and wants me to either reach out to the other doctor in the department or get a second opinion from a different referral. (I should mention, this is not costing me anything to get the MRI or see another doctor, as I've already met my deductible for the year, so both are very doable). At this point, I am really quite unclear about what's causing this or where to go from here. One doc recommends an MRI, one is saying it's not needed but she'll order one if I really want her to. One is telling me it really doesn't seem like migraines, the other is telling me that's probably what it is. I'm inclined to go with whatever the neuro says, as with that being her specialty, it seems she would be more likely to know what to do. However, I am hesitant to think that this is just migraines being caused by something like MSG or sugar or some other life factor that I've been exposed to my entre life when I have never had any issues like this before. I am really at a loss for what to do from here. ",1

11672,"Mid 20s female Hello, lately, over the past few months, I have noticed that about 15 minutes after I wake up I will have these short episodes where it is hard to focus my eyes. It is like I will try to look at an object but my eyes do not want to do it, and the they will not settle on it. I am not sure if what I am describing is double vision, it is more like the feeling of my eyes flailing in all sorts of directions as I try to look at something than double vision, but maybe that is what double vision is? It only ever happens in the morning and only for about 10 minutes when it does. If I rub my eyes it helps a little but not immediately. I have an aunt with fuchs dystrophy so I am slightly concerned with that, but I am a little young I would think and my mom, my aunts sister, has no evidence of fuchs so I dont know. I have also had eyes that feel stingy occasionally lately, like there is something agitating them in the air, so I wonder if they might be dry. But I have never had a problem with dry eyes before so I am not sure. Should I be concerned about this? I am also moderately nearsighted (-3.5 ish in both eyes) if that matters. ",0
11673,"21 Y/O male Just came from the eye doctor who noted that I have ""Bear Tracks"" on both of my eyes.

However, I told another eye doctor about my situation, and he told me that these marks are nothing to worry about. Also important to note, nobody in my family has ever had colon cancer. If I have these ""bear tracks"" on my eyes, am I screwed? Or it is it just a slight possibility that I have FAP.

It usually takes about 2 weeks to adapt if you wear it full time. Having 3 different prescriptions is completely normal. Nearly everyone older than ~40 yo needs progressives because our eyes can no longer focus like they use to so we need to have a different prescription for distance, intermediate, and reading use. The neat thing about progressive lenses is that it's a 3 in 1 so it includes your prescription for distance, intermediate, and reading, and because of this they are more costly. ",0

11682,Does a millimeter or two more of optical zone increase the overall size of the IOL by very much? This is a good question. I'm not qualified to do more than guess at it though. The high power lenses (like SN60WF 29 D) already require a larger incision because of their thickness. I imagine the overall thickness centrally will continue to increase as the diameter increases. Then we run into folding issues if the optic is larger. Also how do you compensate for the haptics? Make them smaller? They might become weaker. Now you might mess with centration. This would require a whole lot of R and D and $$$ on top of the FDA approval process. And it's a big risk - what if after everything there's no significant reduction in side effects? Again just not worth the risk given the low incidence of complaints in the first place. ,0
11683,"Hi, I have a mystery I could use your help with. About 2 months ago when I was wearing monthly contacts, I noticed I had these two redspots in my right and left eye that didn't look quite right. There was no pain or anything. Maybe the ocassional itch. This was after 4 months of wearing the contacts with no issues. Of note, the week before this happened I did overwear my contacts - some days for 12/13 hours. I also work in IT so I'm at a computer most of the day. Eventually, the redness seemed to be isolated to just my right eye when I put in contacts. Left eye was totally fine with contacts. [Eye with redness from Contacts \(right eye\)](https://preview.redd.it/l34xv5v1f3o61. jpg? width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13fa4eccc612fa20a5652f6d7d6bed52290b5cee) After I noticed the redness, I took out my contacts and went to go see a doctor. He told me that I had blepharitis and prescribed me thobradex. I did 4 eye drops for two weeks. I went back for a follow up and he said my inflammation had decreased and the crust in my eyelashes was gone. I then tried a NEW pair of monthly lenses the next day, and immediately I had a reaction where my eye got pretty red. So perhaps I had blepharitis, but I think this showed it wasn't the underlying cause of the redness. I went to another doc for a second opinion. He told me that this was caused by lack of oxygen to the eye and it was related to eye dryness - no underlying pathology. I asked him if there was a diagnosis and he said CLARE. When I take out my contacts, the redness gets a lot better, but what is really bugging me is that there still seems to be ""residue"" from the redness. I don't remember my eye being like that before this all happened and I am really frustrated that it doesn't seem to be going away. It makes me feel like I permanently harmed my eye in some way. Is that redness ever going to go away?? The only other possible thing is that the redness was always there and now I'm just noticing it more -- but I honestly don't believe that's the case. I am also wondering if I'm going to be able to wear contacts...(the doc recommended dailies - I am hoping they don't cause a reaction like a monthlies).

Left eye with -3.00 cylinder and right eye with -1.5. I distinctly recall that for several years the optometrist (not the same optometrist each time) would comment something to the effect of, ""I'm only going to give you about an 85% correction because you actually see better with that than with the full one.""

11695,"Hello. I am not an expert but i am suffering maybe from the same thing. There are few things that gave me a bit of relief. First off, you may not have a dry eye at all. It is called computer vision syndrome and it is giving you digital eye strain. So you may skip the eyedrops and check the results for few days. For me, simple eyedrops made matter much worse. Secondly, what i did was to find out exactly which movement is causing me the pain. For me, it was looking directly down at keyboard/ a piece of paper and immediately looking up. It may be different for you and you may try working in such a manner that this movement is done very less. I personally switched to a laptop and started using it at an arm's length. If i have to copy a from a paper, i would place it right beside the laptop keyboard so that eye movement is minimum. Thirdly, eye massage helped me a great deal. For me the pain starts in between the eye and the nose , so i started massaging it well before the symptoms start. Rubbing your arms together and applying the heat on the eyelids also helped. You may try taking steam besides warm compress. Fourthly, cut off digital work as much as possible. If you have no option, make the screens warm. I have installed f.lux in all screens except the iphone that i have, where i keep it on night mode. Finally, i believe the doctors have no prescriptions for this. Its trial and error. 20-20-20 helps but one must be consciously battling it. I am still recovering, and already posted about this. But i believe there is no oral medicine as such. ",0

11700,"For the past month or so, I was noticing a flash of light out of the corner of my peripheral every now and then. Like a small starburst would pop up on a dim or darkened wall, sometimes while I was in the shower. This isn't new as it had occurred on occasion a few years ago and I was given a dilated exam and told my retinas were fine and not to worry, things should clear up on their own. I never really had any more issues since then, maybe noticing a little flash here and there afterwards, but not very often to the point of forgetting about it. As stated before, the flashes were coming back again and I was seeing them almost every day for about a month. Same starburst pattern out of the corner of my eye. I started getting worried reading about what it could mean, but before I could get around to making an eye appt they stopped for a few days. My worry continued however about what was happening and I decided I'd call if they came back. Then I began seeing different types of flashes. Smaller, like little specks resembling glitter that would pop in and out of my vision every few minutes, even if I was just still, staring straight ahead. So I started panicking and made an appointment which I had today. I explained everything that had been going on with the flashes and requested a dilated exam to check my retinas but everything came back fine. My eyes look structurally healthy, yet the frequent glitter effect and occasional brighter flash continue, seemingly from both eyes. My optometrist explained the glitter sounds like an oxygen deprivation sort of issue and that it could be more related to the brain more than the eye itself as I'm a bit young for a PVD (30 yo). I'm not sure how I could be hypoxic yet have no other symptoms other than the eye flashing. I don't really have any floater issues, my eyes have just been a bit good and sore over the last week with some pulsing and sometimes almost stabbing pain, but it's been getting better. I guessed I'd strained them a bit with all the looking around following all the flashing blips. The optician reassured me that it's nothing serious and should clear up in time. What else could possibly be causing dozens of little flashes a day yet show no sign of retina tear or detachment? I spend way too much time on different screens each day, with the lockdown and all, but I've done so for a number of years and have never had vision issues like this. ",1

Here in the US I believe the standard is 60 hertz meaning that this positive to negative and back to positive occurs 60 times every second. The human eye can only detect at about 20 or so hertz, so anything with a higher frequency will just appear smoothly to the naked eye. This is also why tv and movies work.

Symptoms still remain, but more manageable. Now, going back just a couple months ago I decided to seek an alternative treatment for my neck, shoulder and back pain which was still driving me crazy. I went to an acupuncturist. Nothing she was doing was helping. After speaking over a course of three or four appointments she is convinced it is autoimmune related and not musculoskeletal. She herself had MS and was nearly paralyzed. Changed her diet and she is now happy and healthy. She is pushing me to take Keto a step further and try out Carnivore which I just might. Anyway, this was the first time someone had even mentioned autoimmune to me! Now after some research it's starting to make sense and I can feel myself relating to you all! Funny because I was already familiar with Soeren's syndrome because it would pop up occasionally when I would google that days symptoms. Yesterday I got my blood drawn and now I'm waiting on my results. Would not necessarily be excited to be diagnosed with Soeren's Syndrome, but at least I would have an answer to my mysterious symptoms. Thank you for letting me vent. Feels good to write it out.

11708,"Tl;Dr: looking for recommendations for a good optometrist in the greater Phoenix area, would be nice if they take AHCCCS but not necessary. I was diagnosed with KC about 6 years ago now (was 24 when diagnosed but it had been progressing since I was 17 or so) when I still lived in New Mexico and had insurance. I was getting fitted for hybrid lenses at the time but we didn't get a good fit before I had to move to Arizona. Things got busy and I ended up loosing insurance and haven't been back to an Optometrist since then because it really wasn't impacting my day to day life. I decided to go back to school about 3 years ago now to pursue an engineering degree and the KC has been really annoying in lectures trying to see the board etc. Less of an issue now with everything online thanks to the 'rona but I've been putting off getting my eyes checked out for way too long now. So I'm looking for some recommendations for good Optometrists that are experienced with KC treatments, I'm on AHCCCS at the moment so if they take that great, if not I do have significant financial support that is willing to help pay for things.

I usually wear contacts during the day but decided to wear my new glasses to give my eyes a bit of a break for a few days. I noticed they were a bit disorienting when I put them on, but I got used to them after a few hours. Today I decided to put my contacts on in the afternoon since the glasses were starting to hurt the bone behind my ears and again I feel disoriented and cross-eyed. I've never really had this issue before so I'm just wondering if it's enough of a problem to take the glasses back to the optometrist and see if there's a solution. My prescription is -5.00, DIA 14, BC 8.4. Thanks in advance! Edit: Prescription from 2016 was OD -5.25 Cyl -0.5 Axis 017, OS -5.00 Cyl -0.75 Axis 130 and I don't have this same disorientation when switching between my old glasses and contacts.

In retrospect I often had mild pain in this area when sick or with allergies of which I get hay fever. I make a lot of saliva under tongue but not really sure if parotids do much. I have always had dry eyes, but not hugely impactful on normal life. My eyes are red often but can make big dripping tears if I cry etc. I was negative for Ana and sjogren antibodies, blood test showed very mild levels of inflammation. I have suffered a lot with muscle pain and twitching the last year as well as significant sensory disturbances all over body but these are abating and possibly prompted by a reaction to 5thp. I have now a palpable accessory parotid gland in my cheek which is why my doctor has referred me to ENT. It was screened for cancer/tumour and found to be normal tissue. I feel overall quite well apart from parotid pain mainly on one side but both are tender, one is enlarged and has been I think for 20 years. Sound like anything to anyone?

11738,"I was diagnosed in my late 30's. My vision was relatively stable for a long time. I started wearing hard contacts when I was in high school. I was told that hard contacts would be better for me because of my astigmatism was so high. Perhaps that was the KC and the eye doctors didn't know about it enough to diagnose? Who knows. Anyway, by the time I was diagnosed, I was never given the option of cross linking. I assume now that it was because my vision never really had gotten much worse over the years and the Dr. was really happy with how well the contacts corrected my vision. The older we get the harder the cornea gets and KC usually doesn't progress much. Anyway, years after wearing hard contacts and being progressively miserable, I got scleral lenses. My advise would be to skip trying the traditional hard lenses and go directly to scleral lenses. The scleral lenses really changed my life. The hard lenses always bothered me. Going outside on a windy day was awful as any dust speck gets in the eye and the pain is intense. Running on a dirt road was challenging if a vehicle passed and kicked up a bunch of dust.

I think I read the other post, but only read part of it, and thus didn't realize it was basically the same thing I was asking (my bad)! But hopefully the doctor will be able to help me with it, or just tell me it's not Horner's (honestly either is fine, I'd just rather know if I have it, and if so, work out the root cause of it if possible). But on the development side, so if I was dropped directly on the top of my head from a somewhat tall height as a 10 or 11 year old (I was hanging by my knees on a weird rope thing my friends family had in their front yard when he untied one end of it to prank his sister, who was hanging by her hands, her feet closer to the ground, but he didn't see me, which clearly ended up with it just being a poorly executed prank. It's definitely not as high up as I thought then, but I most likely had a concussion [as I don't remember right before or afterwards other than what others told me], and should have gone to see a doctor, but his mom was a nurse, and I insisted I was fine because I hate being fussed over and so she decided to chase him until he hid in a closet [one of the parts I don't remember, but heard later, and am pretty sure my brain created a memory to fit that scenario]). Could it have started to develop post that due to the injury if it damaged that pathway or muscle in someway, but not been visibly present in my eyes (or at least noticeably enough for anyone to see) until 18 or 19? I'm a 26 year old female, and no one said anything until I was 19. I had noticed before, at around 15 or 16, but had assumed it wasn't anything abnormal (it was very subtle when I first noticed so I was like ""weird""<U+009D> and continued with whatever I was doing). But now with one being able to incredibly tiny, and the other being saucer sized, at the same time, I decided it was okay to worry some (well a while ago I decided this, but haven't been able to get it looked at due to other family things). If I have headaches and migraines, back problems, as well as a change in my mental health state and issues, could those also be connected? I have rational reasons for them not to be (my maternal grandmother had migraines, my mom has them, as well as two of my first cousins on my mom's side also have them, and both sides have minor mental health issues, mine just seem to be A LOT more problematic. I also wore converse forever, including when running, like an idiot, and did horseback riding and ballet, which can logically help dismiss the back pain, since those both often cause those issues. But all of these all seem to be getting worse. But this all also happened around puberty, anyways, so who knows), but was curious if they could also be related? Thank you again! ",1
11749,"Hi, I actually suffer from these symptoms (flashes on white background/sky). It helps to dim the background. I actually also suffer from migraines, and have them frequently with distorted vision beforehand. I have been to a retina specialist (just went to one today), and my eyes are currently still dilated lol. Basically I was told that they didn't find anything wrong with my retina, and that I was completely fine (besides some retinal scarring they found), but they said it was normal and so small that I shouldn't worry about it ever. They recommended me to a neurologist, and said my problems are 99% linked to my migraines more than likely, and that it's a neurological problem. I was told the neurologist would prescribe me a medication that could help my eye problems, as well as my migraines. If you wanna talk about it feel free to chat me! I know it gives a lot of anxiety, so it can be a hard life. I should mention i'm also 21. ",1

It's usually just past about 45-50 degrees to the left or right at anything above eye level and if I really focus or open my eyes wider, I can usually eliminate the double vision, although it's easier to correct on my right side. There's no double vision that I notice at any other angle aside from my small levels of shadowing that I have from my astigmatism. Otherwise, this would never bother me as I usually wouldn't force my eyes to that strained angle anyway. However, I haven't been able to find anything online about whether extreme vision diplopia is normal or not and I'm a little nervous. Just had a full optometry workup this past month. ",0
11753,"So there are two things that can cause dry eyes with computer use. When we use digital devices our blink rate decreases, sometimes drastically depending on the task at hand. And if you have the brightness too low compared to the ambient light or the font too small, you will be straining your eyes to see constantly. The best settings are the ones that enable you to see the screen and it's content easily and comfortably.

11755,"Is ""Wilson"" the ""Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins""? If so, disappointing that they misdiagnosed Kimberly. Is the ""KC institution"" the ""Keratoconus Institute of Maryland"" that is part of OMNI Eye Specialists? If so, I assume Kimberly's doctor is Dr. Ivan Garcia? Based on his website, it sounds like he would be about as good an ophthalmologist as Kimberly could hope for. Are you sure they said they wanted to wait until Kimberly is 16 to do corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) for her right eye? It does sound like her left eye is too badly damaged to benefit from CXL. Did they perhaps say they wanted to defer a corneal transplant on her left eye until she was 16? If Kimberly is being seen at the Keratoconus Institute of Maryland, then I am surprised that they haven't suggested trying contact lenses for her. The practice includes a number of optometrists and they fit all types of contact lenses used for KC. While I have expressed surprise at some of the aspects of Kimberly's eye care, if she is being seen at the Keratoconus Institute of Maryland, then I would assume that she is getting the most appropriate care given all the circumstances. How is Kimberly doing with all this? To us adults it would seem like more than a child could endure. But kids can be remarkably resilient. When I was in Junior High School, two of my friends were a brother and sister with albinism. Their vision was very bad and they had to use devices that highly magnified their reading materials. Nonetheless, they were cheerful, well adjusted kids who took their visual impairment in stride. I hope Kimberly is doing as well with her visual challenges as my Junior High friends did. ",0

I find ways to make ends meet and life goes on. But man the loneliness is killer and like **if I had energy** to do volunteer work or something I would do it and maybe have a chance of meeting someone. Online dating is a nightmare. I did have a brief thing with a young woman (she was 41). She had pretty bad RA and occasional fatigue and I thought, ""Ok, of all people she will understand."" Insert Morgan Freeman voiceover: *She did not understand.* Lately I've been telling myself I just need to get my head around the idea of being alone the rest of my life. Live for the sake of my kids.

11760,"Your present situation sounds like a flair. I've been going through something similar lately. I've learned that eye pain and fatigue are essential to address, since this issue can make functioning unbearable. After your eye doc evaluates you and your eye condition is stabilized you might consider getting punctal plugs to moisten your eyes. Also, restasis really worked well for me. The plugs can take some time to get used to, especially with how tears work with them, allergy debris, etc. I wear Acuvue Oasis contact lenses with Hydraclear Plus moisturizing technology as well. Even though this extra moisture helps with wearing contacts sometimes there are days when my eyes are just burning dry and the lenses are glued to my eyeballs by nightfall! Eye drops without preservatives are a big help here and so are contact lenses rewetting drops. The biggest help for me is a nutrional boost via fish oil. It really helps but you have to take enough to see the changes. And it works pretty fast. I agree with others that dry weather and forest fire smoke is making things almost unbearable in the West. I live where the smoke is hitting up against the mountains and our air pollution right now is worse than winter inversion. As for your other body pain, that's where you have to work with a doc as well. My symptoms started in my thirties too and no-one put them together for years. What saved me is low dose naltrexone. I swear by it, and a diet free of simple carbs. ",0
11761,"Preamble: yes I'll be discussing this with my ophthalmologist as soon as possible. I've had a weird ""issue"" for maybe 4 years now. Maybe 1-2 times a year, I suddenly get double vision without any apparent cause. Closing one eye ""fixes"" the issue. And after a minute or two it sorts itself out and things go back to normal. It's a bit similar to being really drunk, only without the drinking. I've been evaluated many times by ophthalmologists over the last couple of years because of a (tiny) persistent scotoma in one eye, and everything so far has checked out. But for some reason I usually forget to mention the double vision. The one time I did mention it, they ignored it. I suspect they already think I'm wasting their time with the scotoma. Mid 30s, male. Generally healthy, except for frequent migraine auras and being slightly overweight. Any feedback would be most welcome, thanks! ",0

11763,"Hey, all - I'm freaking out and hoping someone has some reassuring experiences or expertise to share. I made an appointment with an ophthalmologist because I had a weird week with blurred vision in my right eye. It's since gotten much better and I suspect it was perhaps related to dry eye, as my allergies were terrible at the time and some eye drops did help. For other reference, I'm F, in my late thirties, no health problems and not overweight. Because of Covid appointments were backed up and I had to wait a month to get in. I went anyway, even though my vision was better. I ended up there for three hours. They ran test after test because: 1. The doctor found one large CHRPE in the back of my right eye. I knew it was there, but nobody had treated it as alarming before. 2. I apparently have large nerves in both eyes. Because of both of these things I had an OCT scan and imaging done. Apparently the discs showed no thinning, and all else, including IOP was within normal limits IOP in left eye was 11, right eye was 12). Macula looks fine, etc. All is good and well except for my large optic nerves, which she says I may have just been born with. She also found a tiny hole in my right retina near the nerve. So now I've got that to be freaked out about, too. But I have to see a retina specialist for that. Anyway, she referred me to an optic neurologist and this really worries me. Like, why refer me when all else looks fine? I find I do better with more information and when I asked her she said it was because of my optic nerves but would say no further. I obtained her notes and the images from the visit (my hospital system allows for this), and her notes say nothing beyond what I've noted above. So... is she just being super careful? Or should I be worried she saw something awful that I somehow can't discern in the notes and is being paternalistically kept from me? Anyone have any similar experiences to share or insider knowledge? To me, a neuro-opthalmologist is a big gun!

11768,"Thank you so much, I really appreciate you taking the time to reply. I was half asleep earlier, so I didn't really answer your full question. I guess it's just kind of terrifying being only 20 and having something like this happening and not knowing how to fix it. It started about a month ago, with just some slight photophobia. Now it's severe eye pain, and extreme photophobia every time I step outside. They told me it's from wearing my contacts for an extended period of time, because I've been wearing them all my life. So I stopped wearing them and switched to glasses. Nothing has been better, in fact I've only had more symptoms. I went back to the doctor a week after my first time going, and he said it could be conjunctivitis (I think the allergic kind.) They also used the eye drops with the UV light to look at my eyes. So far they've given me tobramyacin* combination eye drops in case it was an infection of some kind, I've used OTC Zaditor and Patadeye*. The next medication they're going to give me to try to help is Alrex, but it's around 300$ and insurance won't cover it. I'm a little bit nervous to go pick it up, because if it's that expensive and it does nothing for me, I wasted that money for nothing AND I'm no closer to a solution. I've been looking everywhere online, because I feel like the answers ""your eyes are just irritated""<U+009D> and ""it's just allergies""<U+009D> aren't right and it's getting to the point that I wake up in the morning and I would rather just go back to sleep than deal with the panic attacks of going outside.

11769,"1. The short answer is no, it is not a near-sighted prescription 2. You are right in the assessment that a normal progressive lens is not the best type of lens for constant intermediate work. There are options out there however that will make a progressive lens with a larger intermediate zone at the expense of a smaller distance zone in the lens, but of course that comes with more $$$. Separate glasses for distance and reading may/may not be the most helpful, as the 'just near' or 'just distance' won't technically correct for intermediate. 3. When you say your friend has only gotten reading glasses, do you mean they just have glasses with an Add of +1.50? If so, that would make sense why it works for them on the computer given that just wearing a +1.50 would provide more intermediate vision as opposed to a full near prescription ( Distance numbers and 'add' combined) Bottom Line: It's really about what your friend is most comfortable with. I will say at some point as your friend gets more birthdays they are going to be reliant on the glasses more and more and starting to use a progressive now will make it easier to adjust to them down the road as the 'add' gets higher with age.

Our area is ""okay"" in terms of medical professionals and getting appointments, but it's not the best. We initially planned to see more than one doctor to get more opinions. Downtown core has a lot more promising clinics and doctors, and we initially planned to go there after. My first eye doc appointment went pretty badly. We confirmed I have a cataract on my right eye (completely cloudy and honestly blind). I mentioned to the doctor that I had eczema (I am pretty much free of it, but I wanted to mention it because it is a medical condition I had as a child), and he immediately said he could not operate due to that.

11808,"Hello. I've posted this in r/AskDocs but thought it might be a good idea to post here as well since the issue is eye-related. I'm writing this on behalf of my partner (25m). He's about 5'7""<U+009D>, 200lb and Caucasian. Smokes marijuana a few times a day (in the evening), no cigarettes. Usually drinks a few beers a night, but over the past month, has had barely any alcohol. Currently, he takes 60mg of Prozac for depression. Has never worn glasses, has pretty good vision, no LASIK eye surgery or any other surgery in his life. Today, while we were driving back from a grocery pickup (he was driving), he suddenly said ""everything just went double!""<U+009D> and immediately pulled off the road into a parking lot. He put the car into park and was holding his hand to his eyes. He said it came on very quickly. He was blinking a lot in an attempt to get his eyes to focus. I looked at his pupils and they were both the same size. I asked him to follow my finger left and right, and he had trouble keeping his eyes open to follow. When I started moving my finger up and down, his eyes became very ""confused""<U+009D> and couldn't follow, like he was trying to focus but it was hurting (he said later that he had a minor frontal headache in his forehead and a bit of pain around the eye muscles). I noticed nystagmus in both eyes. I also had him cover each eye, and he noted that both of his eyes were working fine and seeing well on their own, but they weren't working together (""like they were both crossed inwards""<U+009D> he said). We got out of the car to get him some fresh air and I pointed at a plane in the sky and asked him how it looked. He said it was double as well, so it was both near and far double vision. Face wasn't drooping, arm wasn't hurting, no neck pain, no weakness, no difficulty speaking, but minor headache and minor pain around eye. After about five minutes of double vision, he could see fine again, no double vision. It left as quickly as it came on. I asked him if this had happened before and he said it had only happened a few times before, although I didn't ask about when they had happened last. He drove home and seems fine now. An aneurysm was my first worry. Next that came to mind was a stroke, tumour, or some kind of brain swelling. Or something else very serious. I didn't even mention going to the ER because I know he'd shut down the idea immediately. He said he'd mention it to his doctor when he sees him next, which could be weeks or months from now. Should I be pushing further for intervention? Or is this something that can wait a few weeks or even months? I don't want to see something bad suddenly happen. Thank you for any answers in advance.

11810,"On further reading, yes it might be scleral lenses.

Mine is round and even, just like a bigger version of the RGP. Thanks for the tips. This is quite the transition from soft lenses.

Aslo, everyday, before work, to take 30 mins or so trying to put it in, the thought is very unsettling. How long did it take for you to put it in at first, and how long does it take now?

11811,"So, I am an optician at a well established optometrist in my area. We work with a non-profit organization called the Lions Club and once a month they come and pick up all our frames and lenses for donation (at least the ones patients gave up for donations). However, I have often wondered how exactly this even makes sense. Frame donations, sure, its not ideal but a donated frame makes sense to me for those in a third world country. But the lens donations? We take progressives, bifocals, single vision, transitions, anything people donate and they collect and want them. I fail to see how this makes logistical or technical sense though. How would they utilize already cut progressive lenses? They would only work for the matching frame & prescription (or at least one very similiar) and thats also assuming that the pupillary distance and seg ht match up with the donor. Same thing with the bifocal lenses, but I suppose maybe a little more leeway? The only way this really makes sense to me is if the lenses are single vision and in a matching or very similiar frame. Even then, I feel like the people who would most benefit are patients with high prescriptions or high asigmatism, both of which mandate greater accuracy of PDs and OC heights. And even if we were to assume that the technical aspect of this was sound, and that it could be done... Uncoated, CR39 single vision lenses can be had for 50 cents and stock bifocals are not much more. Even lab surfaced multifocal lenses are incredibly cheap without any coatings. I mean, sure the donated lenses may be better lens designs and have AR, but they are also old scratched and yellowed lenses. Perhaps they could strip the coatings to clean em up, though. Anyway, this has just always baffled me and I am honestly just very curious, am I missing something? If so, please enlighten me. Does this actually make sense? ",0

My optometrist's inspection of the eyes did not reveal any damage, but I wonder if these eye changes can be attributed to this blunder.

11816,"Thanks for the feedback. I've been using medical cannabis for the last two years and I feel it has 100% helped me. I roll my eyes at the eye rubbing comment from doctors as I never was an eye rubber! Argh! I tell them it's from the chronic state of inflammation my body is always in but they never listen. I do notice my eyes are slightly more blood shot but pressure wise my eyes have ALWAYS tested normal since using cannabis (if anything, cannabis has lowered the pressure from the coning out effects I deal with). It also depends on the mindset of the doctor. The one surgeon I talked to said I could not be on medical cannabis as it increases the pressure drastically in the eyes. I told them I have heard cannabis does the opposite as far back as the 90's when I had a friends dad who was prescribed cannabis for his glaucoma! Plus there is numerous data showing cannabis lowers intraocular pressure, but try sharing this data with most allopathic doctors and your wasting your breath. They would rather see me doped up on prednisone, meloxicam and pain pills and suffer all the side effects than needing to use ONE medicine, cannabis. I had two epi on procedures and one of them worked for about 8 years, the first one I got when I was about 27-ish. The second epi on was bunk as the light wasn't uv (I went to the same place in California.) 3rd C3R treatment was epi-off and it barely did anything as I felt the b-vitamin formula and UV light wasn't the same as what I had in California back in 2007-ish. If I do corneal transplant surgeries I feel that medical cannabis could be a benefit but I need to find a doctor who is in agreement with this. I have read literature on medical cannabis as to why it Cannot be used for solid organ recipients (lungs, heart & especially kidneys) due to medical cannabis being stated that it lowers immunity to fungal infections and kidney transplants are highly susceptible to fungal infections that lead to failure of the transplant.

Note that this could also be a retinal migraine which takes place in one eye only and is due to blood flow irregularities. Back to detachment/tear you may also see a huge increase in the number of floaters in that eye. If you usually see the normal amount but then see 50 floaters or big floaters.

11832,"Hello, Just a heads up, I typed a whole book below, so sorry for the length. My experience isn't one of already having had a baby, but going through the pregnancy currently. I'm hoping it will be helpful to you and that you will feel less alone... If I had to give a quick **TLDR** of the below of what is helping me the most it has definitely enrolling in the research study (described in the bulleted list) and getting real about the core of my feelings and accepting the vulnerability of what means to be pregnant. **The Book:** I too am pregnant with high Anti-Ro, (but also not diagnosed with Sjogren's or any autoimmune disorder officially). I just got lucky that the autoantibodies were caught due to inflammation of my eye that they couldn't figure out, so they ran a bunch of tests and it showed up. I am now 20w5d pregnant (first time) and am in the thick of the high-risk period for someone in our situation (Week 16-28 approx). While I'm doing much better now, over the summer while trying to conceive, and most of early pregnancy, I was terrified, isolated, lonely, and depressed about it. I even experienced the same feelings of self-hate that you describe. Like I was an awful person for having this and it was going to harm my baby. It got to the point where my mom and husband were feeling really down because I didn't want to celebrate the pregnancy or plan or do any of the fun stuff people do when they're pregnant. I was just so focused on potential loss as if it were a guarantee... The way I was handling it before was to just constantly read everything I could - all the research articles I could get my hands on/every reddit story etc... and then just trying to suppress it/numb out during the rest of the time. But like any type of ""checking"" behavior it never really works to permanently reduce anxiety and sometimes just makes it worse. Eventually I started going in a quiet room and night and meditating and then allowing the emotions to come out rather than trying to ""research my way out of the fear."" What I realized when I started quieting my mind and allowing the emotions was that I was trying to avoid getting attached to the baby because I was so terrified of the vulnerability and the pain it would cause. But the truth was, I was already attached to the baby. If something happened I was going to hurt/be devastated no matter what. I couldn't prepare my way out of the pain. Something also clicked within me that the reality is, no pregnancy is fully without risk. There is always some chance something could go wrong and that doesn't stop others from enjoying and celebrating their pregnancies (Not to discount the stress of knowing ahead of time that you are at a specific percentage risk for a specific issue). I also realized I was being incredibly hard on myself and blaming myself and the almost punishing myself (and everyone else around me) for the situation. I had to let go and I started to be kinder to myself about the whole thing. I also thought about how I would help my future child through fears and feelings of her own. How can I face scary things and possibly incredibly painful things? How could I live the way I would want her to be able to? I don't want to make it sound like it has all been an airy fairy /crystals and incense type experience either though, because there are some grounded practical steps I've taken to handle the stress and fears as well. 1. My rheumatologist put me on plaqunil while I was trying due to the literature showing that it quite possibly cuts the risk of heart block in half. It is my understanding this can be effective if started by 10 weeks. Forewarning if you seek to be put on the medicine, you may get some push back because the studies have only been done on mothers that have already had a child with heart block, not first time mothers. My maternal fetal specialist said while they didn't think it was necessary, they considered the medicine safe and would go along with the rheumatologist. Being on HCQ has given me some added peace of mind. 2. I continued to see a counselor and have been able to talk with her about my fears and the pregnancy process as well as some of the darker feelings of blaming myself etc... This has been very helpful. 3. I enrolled in a research study for Anti-Ro positive mothers. The primary investigator of the study is one of the top researchers in this area (Jill Buyon out of NYU Langone). The student is called StopBloq [https://stopbloq.org](https://stopbloq.org) 1. Basically they sent me an at home fetal doppler monitor and provided training videos and sample audio files of normal/abnormal heart rates. I then take a reading 3 times and day and send it over to them. If at any time something sounds out of the norm, I can text an on-call pediatric cardiologist who will review the audio file and let me know if I need to have an emergency echocardiogram. They linked me up with a research site in my state where I can go if necessary. Having this added support has been an amazing blessing. 2. In summary, I hear her heartbeat 3 times a day in conjunction with the normal standard of care weekly echocardiograms at my local maternal fetal medicine specialist. Hearing it before I go in makes it so much less scary... like ""oh my gosh what are they going to find this week"" type thing. 3. If you are in the USA and less than 18 weeks pregnant you may be able to enroll in the study if you are interested. There are some states without a participating site, but many states have one. 4. I got a better understanding of the reality of heart block. It is common amongst those of us with this autoantibody to know the 2%/16-20% numbers. 2% if you're a first time mom, 16-20% if your a mom who has already had a baby with heart block. But what I wasn't familiar with was... if it happens, then what. Well, the fact is more babies with this type of heart block live than die. That is not to discount complications they can have nor the scary reality of the 20-30% who pass away. But it did help me to realize that the worst case scenario for a first time mom was a small percent of the already small percent if that makes sense. I really hope something in the long wall of text has been helpful for you. I know how awful and dark the feelings can be and I hope you can get some relief from them. ",0

I see this rarely done now and doubt this is what she was referring to. I'm not sure why she needs the PCP but my best guess is that she wants to do a visual field and OCT but she lacks the equipment so she needs to refer you. Maybe the referral to a specialist with the equipment is needed by your PCP for insurance purposes? I'm not sure, but you should clarify. 20 isn't a crazy high pressure but with someone who has a family history of glaucoma it should be something to watch on your regular exams. ",0

11839,"Hello I have been experiencing dizziness for more than 4 years. But what I mean by dizziness is something different from what dizziness really is. It is not like you are spinning or so. Imagine that you are holding your phone horizontal and have opened the camera. Just shake it gently and then just stop doing so and hold it normally. That is the kind of experience I am suffering. Years ago I had an MRI test and nothing came up and as well I had a balance test to check my inner ear and nothing came up either. So I thought that it would be psychological but I have had a time when I needed to use antidepressants and I really benefited from them but that dizziness problem didn't go away. So I think too it has nothing to do with my psychology and it was just a short time I am totally fine. I have an high astigmatism and myopia like 7. I have been using glasses more than 10 years. Every optician I visited said that dizziness has nothing to do with eyes and my eye tests came up pretty good like retina, corneal tests, etc. It has really no pattern like it happens when I am sitting or walking or whatever. But what I noticed is that it tends to be worse when I use computer more than usual. It is like the veins in my eyes have a kind of pressure on them. In extreme cases of that dizziness, the vision or the environment spins so fast that I feel like holding an object and it lasts 5-10 seconds and during that time it is like my brain gets lighter and you know like something is being extracted from my brain but when it stops this feeling goes. It is the extreme and continual version of that telephone camera example and it happens rarely. I feel uncomfortable in my daily life because I have continuous fear that that may happen while driving or crossing roads etc. I also suspect that it may be due to some problems in my neck area or so but I have no posture problems or neck pain or so. That dizziness sometimes even happen in bed like just lying. Do you know the feeling you are falling down in your dream and wake up jumping? Yeah that is exactly what is happening sometimes though it is extremely rare but very unpleasant. Have anyone experienced. something like that please let me know and share your experiences/guesses etc. Thank you â™¥ï¸ Edit1: I have seen an optician for routine check and my eye numbers are same for 1 year or so. However I have noticed long time ago that with my right eye (which has a higher number like 7+ astigmat than my left eye which is like 5+ astigmat) I see worse. Is it normal because I can't read the same things that I can read with my left eye. Aren't glasses supposed to correct vision? Or the high number difference between my eyes causes so ? Is it somehow related to dizziness? I was about to ask this to my optician but I was so desperate that I forgot :( ( I have to say that I see well with my glasses but it is just one eye closed observation of mine hope I expressed myself well) Edit 2: I was a kind of person who used to spend more than 5 hours in front of a screen however for 2-3 years I am using it when necessary and for a short period of time. Can it be related to that fact like my eyes can't handle it anymore ? Has it become oversensitive and maybe somehow causes my eye veins to overwork and put pressure on them and this in turn makes me dizzy. ",0
11840,"I'll start off by saying that I realize am in a very fortunate position compared to many here. This isn't a post to brag but rather hopefully give some insight to those that may be where I was a few years ago. Keratoconus runs in my family (my mom has had a transplant in each eye) so it was always something that I had been terrified of getting. I was always very diligent in bringing it up to my eye doctor any time I had an appt. About 6 years ago, I got the update that I'd need to go see an opthalmologist who specializes in Keratoconus. Sure enough shortly after, I was diagnosed. The good news was that it was still early. I was still able to see 20/20 with glasses, but I knew it was a race against the clock for me. At the time, the US wasn't fully approved for CXL so I made sure to be even more diligent in getting routine exams until it was. After it became approved in the US, about 3 years ago, I got CXL in my ""bad"" eye and a few months after that got it in my ""good"" eye. Now every time I go see the eye doctor, I'm paranoid that my eyes are still progressing and that CXL wasn't effective for me. However, last week during my yearly exam, my eye doctor told me that my prescription and eyes have stabilized and there was very little change from the year before. I was over the moon! Not only that, she was now able to fit me with (non-custom) soft contacts for astigmatism!!! (Like what people without Keratoconus wear!) I almost cried right there in the office. Again, I realize that I'm in a very rare position and that seeing 20/20 with glasses let alone wearing soft contacts is out of the question for many. But I just wanted to share this because early detection and treatment was key for me. With Keratoconus, it's not a matter of if, but when and how fast your eyes get worse. Yes, even possibly in an eye that may be ""good"" right now. If you're on the fence about CXL, and your doctor is advising you to get it, imo it's absolutely worth the pain and frustration for a few months after. (I'm not a doctor so please only follow your Doctor's advice.) Or if you're nervous you have Keratoconus, see a doctor asap. The sooner you do, the better. ",0

",1
11850,"Sometimes the lighting also play a role, when its darker or indoors, you need to squint your eyes to focus more which eventually leads to fatigue eyes. It can also be that at 5.30 pm, your eyes become tired since you have focus all morning to see clearly. Spectacles helps in reducing the eyes effort to focus preventing fatigue eyes . Since your vision isn't that bad, maybe you have a mild accommodation problem( ability of eyes to focus) but it is common for the eyes to be slightly blurry when you use it a lot. Nowadays, prolong near task or online class can also cause prolong strained eyes making it easily fatigue. When your vision gets blur, just try to relax (check out 20-20-20 rule).

Yes I know some people don't like people buying glasses online but my prescription changes often and I have other eye issues that lead me to needing to get new glasses more often than I can through insurance. I've never had any issue with seeing out of glasses or adjusting to new glasses even when I get them online. After having a horrible time with eye strain I went to a new eye doctor as mine retired. My vision had changed enough it's causing issues. She gives me a new script and says see you next year as my insurance WILL cover yearly exams just not new glasses. This is my script: OD -9.75 Cyl -1.00 Axis 075 OS -10.25 Cyl -1.00 Axis 110 New eye doc says my PD is 33/33 Get my glasses and wear them for 2 days and I'm violently ill. Dizzy, eye strain, horrible headache, misjudging distances. Honestly it was so bad I put my old ones from my old Optometrist back on.

Lens experiences are going to vary for everyone, but for me the fit in my right eye is as good as it's going to get. That means the lens can pop out the moment I open the eye too wide, if it gets too dry, or seemingly at random when I make the mistake of turning my head too quickly, or dare to refocus on a fast-moving object. My Optometrist has tried to improve the fit in recent years, but that brought enough of a deterioration in vision that I'd rather take the unstable option. *Sometimes I'll go for periods of a few weeks making it through days without any incidents, but in the past fortnight I've had a few days where it's decided to go three or four times. To try to counter that I take it out later in the day to wet it with solution and reinsert. Never going to be ideal, but it helps me through it.

11857,"So glad that you are getting Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) even without a definite diagnosis. At least your treatment isn't suffering due to a lack of dx. Make sure that they did the early Sjogren's test on you; those were the *only* tests I got that were positive. They are new, not everyone knows about them. I also agree on Sjogren's Foundation - they rock. Don't worry about not having a DX, it sounds like you are in good hands without it. I'd keep an eye on my tests to make sure that you are being tested regularly. It's always smart for an autoimmune patient with brain fog to keep an eye out for their thyroid tests. Brain fog and muscle pain are huge in hypothyroidism and there's quite a lot of variation in how GPs and endos test and treat for it. Two women with the same symptoms and same test results will often have different treatment options because one doc will not treat and one will. It can make a huge difference in quality of life that you have a doc who understands the more current strategies. Most patient groups are up on this and will explain it to you if you want to know more. Consider yourself one of us, and welcome. Most of us were in limbo where you are for a really long time. I'm 60, have been sick since I was a kid and just got my DX about 3 years ago. ",1
11858,"This is a very interesting topic for me. I developed hearing loss in my 30s, maybe earlier.

I was in college (late bloomer) and sat up front; however, I didn't attribute that to hearing loss. I was helping out a friend who was in school to become an audiologist. She ran hearing tests on me to practice her skills. After two tries, she had her professor testing me. It was then I learned the extent of my hearing loss. I was told it was likely sensorineural because nothing else was found. Yes, I was experiencing autoimmune symptoms but was not diagnosed until many years. Interesting enough, my two older sisters started having hearing loss but not until their late 50s. I wear bilateral hearing aids, for many years now. Digital vs analog? Digital all the way!

11860,"Hi guys, thanks for any answer! I don't know where to seek help in quarantine **First,** i don't know what i have. It all started five years ago (i'm 30 now) as maybe a common problem of eye strain, everytime i read more than 20 pages of a book my eyes felt tired, if i kept reading i usually felt a weird kind of headache that tylenol couldn't fix, even if it was a lesser pain. After that i was so tired that couldn't keep reading, or playing videogames, or using my phone. At the next day, most of the time i still felt fatigued, but i could read or play and start my problem all over again. **Second**, two or three years ago a new kind of problem started. Sometimes, maybe once per month, little drops of blood in the white of my eyes appeared *(derrame ocular* is the name in spanish, i don't know the translation in english), along with visible veins in the white of my eyes too. They come for no reason at all, even if had a normal day without reading or focusing my vision on something. When i see my eyes like that i know i'm going to have an awful day. Usually i can't do nothing when it happens, i feel worse than when i have normal eye strain, i feel an abnormal blood pressure (maybe high, i eat lemon when it happens to fix it), after a few hours my eyebags turn really dark, even the parts of my nose surrounding my eyes turn dark, and even at the next day when i feel better they keep looking like that for a while. One day i just didn't care about that blood in my eyes and kept reading, the result was so extreme that i puked, i felt like drunk, and i had to go to the hospital at 2 am!! Which by the way, they didn't know what to do. **Third**, i have gone to the ophtalmologist (that's the name in english? Or optometrist? haha) three times for this problem. They all have given me similar prescriptions for my glasses. They were quite fast to treat me and they didn't care that much of what i said, one of them told me it was my constant use of my phone (then i forced myself to completely not use my phone for one week but i still felt pain after playing or reading), the other said it was a ""brain"" problem for the imbalance between my eyes. I don't know if that's right because i didn't felt this when i was younger, specially at university when i read all day and night. And my prescriptions haven't changed that much since i was like 22 and changed my glasses. **Fourth**, i have used ocular lubricants and they make me feel better, but they just delay my problem. I have used three brands, one local brand had hypromellose and dextran, and the other two are Systane Ultra and Systane Balance. The three just give me the same result, i still feel tired, but at least i can keep living. The three can't do nothing about the problem i have when blood appears in my eyes. This is the last prescription given to me, i think i have astigmatism and hypermetropia in the left eye (which is my ""bad"" eye) ||Sphere|Cyl|Axis| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |O.D|\+0.25|\-1.25|11<U+00B0>| |O.I|\+3.00|\-4.00|176<U+00B0>| DP: 63 I really hope anybody can help me.

11861,"your doctor seems to be of the opinion that correcting the full amount may cause you to become overcorrected and have an eye drift postoperatively. Since you're 23 years old that double vision that you would get from being over corrected wouldn't be something that you would get used to or go away on its own, unless your eyes eventually started to cross back and words again. if you wear glasses then prism can be added to your glasses to help correct the double vision if you were to have it after surgery otherwise you would have to cover one eye with an eye patch. the reason you don't have double vision right now is due to a phenomenon called suppression. Your right eye is the one that turns in and it was probably like that since you were a little child going by the history that you gave. when you were little and your eye started turning in you would have initially had double vision and your brain would have basically turned your right eye off to avoid the double vision. Turning that eye off is called suppression and it happens in the brain. Children's brains have the ability to create suppression but adults brains do not. We lose the ability to do this somewhere around the end of the first decade of life. Once kids start developing suppression they can also develop what's called amblyopia, which is a reduced visiob due to inactivity of the eye caused by suppression. Suppression only affects part of the eye, called a scotoma. The part of the eye that's being turned off depends on if the eye is crossing in words are drifting out words. Because your eye is crossing in there is a very specific part of the eye that's being turned off. If we were to realign your eyes and over-correct you so that your eye is now drifting outward it would be a different part of your eye that would be receiving stimulus. That part of the eye was never trained to turn off and the result would be that you would have double vision. ",0

I have posterior uveitis and chorioretinitis that is under control with immunosuppressants (although im tapering off them now) as well as hashimoto's. My eye doctor said that my dry eye is almost definitely caused by my autoimmune issues. Is lipiflow safe with these conditions? I have been flare free for 1 year on immunosuppressants.

11866,So about a month ago I woke up to my vision being cloudyish. We had gotten a dog a few days prior to it and I have a dog allergy. It gets better with eye drops but comes back same with allergy medicine. The only relief I get is being away from home. I also find it worse when I'm straining my eyes. From wake up to bed I'm on an electronic screen or reading. I couldn't get in to the eye doc until this week and I'm honestly terrified. I'm 21 M. I'm supposed to wear glasses I have an astigmatism in both eyes and far sighted? I'm the one that can see close but has trouble far away. I was kinda meh about it and didn't wear them and they got broke and I just never thought to go to the eye doc until now that I have an issues. Also can someone dumb down for me cloudy vs blurry? I may be describing my symptoms wrong. Any advice or reassurance would be helpful. ,1
11867,"It doesn't matter. I'm in my 30's and I still get patients who say, ""you seem too young to be a doctor"". I don't ask a woman her age, but the doctor I work with wears bifocals and patients still think she's too young to practice. I swear some people think you need to be 70+ to be a doctor. You graduate, get married, and have kids whenever *you* want. ",0
11868,I'm 26 too and I feel you. Don't be discouraged. Talk to your doctor about how it's affecting you and keep exploring different treatment plans. ,1
11869,"Keeping in mind frequency is all relative. While it may look very frequent to you, it may still be infrequent enough that the doctor is comfortable watching it, and feels that binocular development is not significantly impacted. As for glasses, the issue isn't keeping glasses on a child, so much as that the doctor likely determined that glasses won't be helpful. Prisms aren't always practical. Some children don't respond well to programs (as in, their eye turn isn't affected by the prisms), and sometimes the size of the turn is large enough that it would require more prism than is feasible in glasses. As for angle measurements, your doctor likely took some, or at least estimated the size. Infants and toddlers can be finicky, which makes getting a truly accurate angle measurement difficult. Ultimately though, an angle of (for example) 25 vs 35 prism dioptres should not affect management at this stage. You asked about patching - the literature that exists on patching for intermittent exotropia is not on strict consensus. Most data shows either no benefit, or modest benefit. I am not aware of any data showing negative effects in this situation. If you're not comfortable with your doctor's recommendations, there is no harm in seeking a second opinion. ",0
11870,"Well friends, it was great while it lasted. Just got home from the doctor. Transplant in my right eye is getting VERY old. Transplants are only supposed to last 20-25 years. Mine at a whopping 40 years is finally wearing out. Doctor wants me to have another transplant in 6 months. The left eye is fine at the time and I am seeing 20/40. That graft is another whopping 38 years. It is not rejecting, just getting OLD and the vision is not as good. ",0
11871,"Just keep fighting. I feel SO much better now than I did ten years ago. My symptoms are mostly under control and after changing my diet, starting to exercise and dropping 80 lbs I feel pretty great again, you got this, you're stronger than Sjogren's! ",0
11872,"Yes. Since you're only becoming nearsighted now, it most likely depends on how you use your eyes. I stopped getting worse at 20 years old, when I asked my optician to give me weaker glasses for computer distance. A friend of mine, who was just starting to experience worse vision and headaches after late evenings, was prescribed positive lenses to prevent strain and he's kept his 20/20 vision so far. I don't know what strategy would be best for you, maybe it's fine just not using glasses, or maybe some weak reading glasses could be helpful. You could ask your optician (or follow the DIY path if you know what you're doing). I can add that adding even a subtle element of motion when working close, thus not standing still like a statue, works wonder in helping your eyes bring things into focus. ",0
11873,"The drug that may cause blindness is called plaquenil. The blindness is caused by retinal toxicity, but that is very rare. You get yearly eye exams while on plaquenil so that they can test for the retinal toxicity. When they catch it early, the vision loss can be reversed. Plaquenil is a drug that is used to prevent systemic complications from Sjogren's and organ involvement. It is literally the most mild drug they can give you in terms of side effects. I would consider doing some more research before shutting it down. You are young, you don't want to develop any organ damage from this disease. BTW, I am 20 years old and have been on plaquenil for almost 16 years. I have not had any retinal toxicity. ",1
11874,"THIS! I was in excruciating pain for years, but too ashamed to go to the dentist. When I finally got up the nerve for a consultation, the tech came in to do a teeth cleaning. I told her I was there for a consultation as my teeth couldn't be saved. I started crying, ashamed. I didn't have my Sjogrens diagnosis, but I'm celiac and that can cause teeth damage, too. The dentist came in and was very sweet and understanding. That made all of the difference. She was upset I had waited so long as I had to have been in extreme pain, which I was. We made a plan to pull my remaining top teeth and the molars on my bottom left that were causing great pain. It took me a long time to heal due to autoimmune disorders. Finally had to go on steroids. That helped. We didn't have dental insurance, but this office financed in house. They added 10% and we had to put 30% down. We pulled some money out of our 401k to cover half of it. Otherwise, I would never have been able to afford it. I didn't get the bottom done while I was there because I was working full time and going to work without teeth was not an option. I couldn't stay home for weeks and weeks. Please consider offering in house credit, if you don't already. I've needed to get the bottom done, but am facing the same issue, but with insurance. We moved to a different state and I need to find a new dentist. It's scary. We also took a huge loss in income by moving. I worked for my husband and the owner, husband was VP, understood my health issues and allowed flexibility. My health has gotten worse, as well, and I'm currently appealing a denial for disability. Thus, we lost $40k a year. It's a lot harder to come up with the money. We are building our own home, we are living in it, but it's not complete, without financing. My husband is literally doing all the work himself. (The owner sold his company and we were promised part of the sale. We got $11k. His severance should've been 60k and vacation another 60k. We kept that business open for 10 years and got the shaft. Still pisses me off. We had to cash out his 401k to pay for the property and get the building up.) So here I wait. I have one intact bottom molar. The other, which had a root canal, broke apart and the filling is gone. I have 9 bottom teeth and they are all rotten. I'm scared, again. Having so many problems with the previous experience and with my plate. I really need to get posts in top and bottom to anchor them in so I can enjoy eating again. What I recommend? In house credit. Advertise that y'all have experience with dental problems due to autoimmune disorders. Somehow let people know that y'all understand and they shouldn't be ashamed. And... compassion, compassion, compassion. Thank you for going out of your way to help a little known community. Y'all are on the right track. ",0

It's a fairly immediate outcome, I found my vision was clear with the stitches in and fairly stable. The healing is fast and not too uncomfortable, it did change my prescription quite dramatically but that's apparently unusual and the surgeon has recommended specialist laser surgery to improve it (currently been delayed due to COVID). Can't comment on price of care or anything if you were looking for info there as UK-based so NHS covered everything. All in all 10/10, would recommend, hah. ",1
11876,"Something else I factor in is how much of your life are you willing to spend in school. You can be in and out of optometry school by 26 years old if you take no gap years and are on the conventional track. You're going to give up a lot more years in MD school, albeit earn more money. The pay is less in optometry, but I've never been happier. I come from a family with parents who don't make a lot of money. $140k a year is life changing for me. I can pay loans, have my own place and help my parents a little financially too. ",0

Years later I was diagnosed at 23, after going to an optician and they couldn't help me and then the doctor in the hospital just wrote keratoconus on a piece of paper and told me to google it. I have a pair of contactlenses i got years ago, but i never wore them much because it was like having sand in my eyes, but lately i feel like trying out scleral lenses since sometimes it does bother me that I can't see very well.

He told me that the previous optimist had over prescribed me and that it would expedite eye issues as I age (I'm mid 30's). The problem is that I was having trouble reading signs and it was generally annoying wearing the new prescription. I went back in several weeks later and he compromised a bit and raised the power up a bit to -5.75 and -5.25, but it's still not enough. He is willing to write me a script for my old prescription but warned me of the potential problems. He told me that my eyes have gotten weak because they are use to a higher powered lens and to wait some days or weeks and my eyes will adjust. Is this true? It honestly sounds like BS to me so seeking a second opinion here. ",0
11880,"So, I'm 19 y/o and have always had pretty good eyesight my entire life (no glasses, contacts, etc.). I received my first dose of the Phizer Covid-19 vaccine on March 15th. I didn't really have any immediate side effects (other than sore arm). About 3 days later, my family and I did a small road-trip to another city and I did the driving. It was about a 4-hour drive (stopped 1-2 times), but that was when I first noticed that my eyes were getting a little strained. When we got to the hotel, I noticed my eyes were a little red but they didn't feel so fatigued yet. I'm also slightly allergic to cats, and I think that the room we stayed in may have had a cat previously as it was a ""pet-friendly hotel."" We stayed there for about 3-4 days and I noticed that my eyes would tend to burn up when inside the room (what usually happens when I'm near cats / cat fur) but they were relatively fine when outside / outdoors. Anyways, so I thought the eye burning/itching would have stopped by the time we got home, but it didn't really. I tried stye eye drops and pink eye drops but they didn't really do much. I also tried some antihistamine allergy medicine some days, and it sometimes helped a little. I also tried cold compress with a cold, wet towel, but it only provided some temporary relief. This went on for about two weeks and now, they no longer burn/itch. However, as of the past week-ish, I've gotten some substantial eye fatigue. I also tried some artificial tears recently, thinking I had dry eyes, but that didn't really help at all. I haven't really had any changes to my normal sleep schedule, stress-level, or total computer/screen usage either. I've also tried wearing those blue-light filtering glasses when using my laptop. I even got 10 hours of sleep the other day and still woke up to tired eyes. I got my second dose this past Monday and towards the end of the day, I could barely keep my eyes open (this is coming off of 10 hours of sleep too). I've also been getting some migraines/headaches because of the eye fatigue. Lying down does help the discomfort a little tho. I'm at a loss of what to do now. My whole productivity has kinda been ruined. I thought it would have resolved itself by now after 3 weeks, but apparently not. Even during allergy season, I've never really had problems with my eyes at all really. I can't really pinpoint what else was the cause other than the vaccine which is unfortunate. Does anyone have any suggestions / recommendations what to do? ",1
11881,"Hope I'm not too late to this - I had a reply typed out within half an hour of posting and it just... Didn't post? My wifi is terrible, so not surprising. Here's what I wrote: Another 24 year old year with a large part of her self-identity stemming from her intellectual prowess chiming in here. I've probably had Sjogren's since I was 8, and Hashimoto's before that. While brain fog hasn't been my *primary* symptom or even my tertiary symptom, it has been the one I have struggled emotionally with more than any other. I'm also working on my PhD in physics, and so the brain fog has impacted my work quite substantially. Looking back on the tail end of my four-year undergraduate experience, what I now know as the Sjogren's brain fog started to kick in. It would manifest in the form of being unable to focus on anything for more than about 5 minutes when previously I could focus on something uninterrupted for 50+min stretches. On brain fog days, I wouldn't be able to retain new information, and any work I did would either be completed agonizingly slowly (like you said, hours for a single page of information), or that work would be riddled with errors. It was incredibly frustrating for those last two years of uni, and especially my last semester when it was most frequent and I had 3 senior projects to complete. It got worse when I started my PhD two years ago. Everything I learned my last two years of undergrad, including the base physics I need to do any higher-level work, has evacuated my brain because of the brain fog I had during undergrad. Even worse, the brain fog days became more frequent, and the brain fog itself became more intense. I ended up having to go on medical leave in November 2019 because the previous 6 months had gotten so bad. I'd been hospitalized for other symptoms off and on in October, and the brain fog rendered me quite literally unable to do any work on my research. The best I can describe it is that my vocabulary almost entirely vanished. I could barely form coherent sentences. I couldn't read, partly because I had double vision constantly, and partly because my brain would get part way through a sentence and then fizzle out so completely that my vision would go entirely white, all my thoughts would completely scatter, and sometimes, in addition to forgetting what the sentence had contained up to that point, I'd forget where I was and my own name. The same ""words go white"" phenomenon, as I was able to succinctly and ineffectually describe it to my doctors, was also prevalent when I was writing, coding, or speaking. This meant I couldn't learn new ideas. I couldn't hold concepts in my head long enough to form connections or generate ideas. I couldn't do anything that would move my PhD forward. Hell, I couldn't even form thoughts like ""I'm hungry"" or ""My joints are very crunchy and it hurts a lot"" or ""I need to move this spoon to my mouth so I can get enough calories to not die."" It was really bad. While the only way to address my issues this last year was through medication, something that I understand isn't in the cards for you, the meds haven't completely helped the brain fog go away. I'm *still* on medical leave (thanks, covid), but I am trying to do some light work at home, and I've found some ways to get by. Like with you, trying a series of strict regimens of diets and supplements did absolutely nothing for me, and exercise only serves as a stress reducer. Valuable at times, but not a complete solution. Instead, in order to compensate for the Sjogren's brain fog, I use skills I learned from the brain fog I've experienced with Hashimoto's for the last decade. When I feel the ever-present brain fog increasing in severity, I take a series of steps: 1) I make myself a cup of tea, no matter what I was doing before. I find that the tea and the process of making it helps me calm down emotionally, and as others have stated, your own stress can be your biggest obstacle with the brain fog. While making/drinking it, I prepare for the rest of my day as will be discussed in steps 2 and 3. 2) I think about how I can change my schedule for the rest of the day to be as non-physical as possible. Doing lots of physical activity when the brain fog peaks makes me less able to do anything mental, so I try to adjust what my day holds to the best of my control to prioritize the mental tasks. Where can I take a bus instead of walking or driving? Do I have the budget and supplies to eat pre-prepared meals instead of cooking? Can I skip my band or kung fu practice this evening? 3) I think about all the tasks I have for the rest of the day and the rest of the week. Is there anything immediately due tomorrow that I have to power through? If so, I move that immediately to the top of my to-do list so I can complete it before the brain fog gets too overwhelming. Then, I move anything that requires learning important information or writing papers to the bottom of my list so I can tackle them when the brain fog is less bad. More minor tasks I find I have success in during brain fog are menial and repetitive tasks, like number crunching, replying to daily emails, organizing my workspace and research items, and developing soft skills. 4) Once I have a handle on how I can adjust my day, I make another cup of tea and move myself into a workspace that has at least one spot of a completely bare, white wall or ceiling easily visible from where I sit. When the brain fog starts becoming overwhelming and stressful while I work, I stare at that blank spot for a while and do my best to think of nothing because the lack of stimulation it provides clears my head. This makes me less stressed and makes the brain fog temporarily less invasive. Some days, staring at that spot 3 minutes out of every hour is enough to stay productive. Some days, I have to space out to it for half an hour at a time to accomplish anything. On bad days, sometimes I just lay down on the floor for a bit while I veg to the blank spot on the wall. 5) I keep tea and water readily available throughout the day, as well as small snacks. When the brain fog gets bad, I've found that taking a literal minute to disengage from my work and focus on the act of eating/drinking re-energizes my brain. I've found particular success switching back and forth between green tea, lemon and ginger tea, and hard ginger candies. 6) The SECOND emotions start to come in, the second I start feeling frustrated at my brain instead of the work, I stop. Walk away. Go to the bathroom. Stare at a blank wall in another room. Go outside and listen to birds. Whatever. Just physically remove myself from the frustration until I am calm again. The only way to live and have any form of productivity with constant and persistent brain fog is to not let it rule my life. To live with it as a symbiote because it never really goes away, yes, but to not bow to it. Some days are better, some days are worse, and I find doing these things allow me to let my brain rest throughout the day while still feeling as though I'm productive amd proactive. I think it works because these tasks focus on clearing my head to prevent me from wallowing in the stress and depression. With Sjogren's, stress is one of the biggest factors in worsening a flare. It can be tough to acknowledge the internal stress brain fog causes, and so incredibly easy to write everything off as ""if only I work harder, I'll be better."" My ability to function increases a thousandfold when I listen to my brain instead of my stress and insecurity. If my brain doesn't want to work, I don't work. I stare at a blank wall or listen to music or go for a walk or make tea, whatever feels right in the moment, and I trust my brain will tell me when it is ready to work again. It never takes my brain as long to rest and recover as the voice of fear in my head screams at me that it will. Also, when the resource you depend on more than anything else for your identity and your career fails you continuously, it is hard not to experience depression. Like someone said earlier, it's not a depression as we generally think of it per se because you know what's causing it, but the constant undercurrent of fear, not knowing if your brain will fail you so completely that you have to change who you are at your core and so that you'll never be able to do any of your favorite activities again, is harrowing. It's trauma. Listen to your body. It knows best. In a way, I'm lucky my brain fog started at 15, because I was able to learn how to listen to my body in order to combat brain fog while in the safety net of easy classes and no bills. It's harder when you're older and there are real-life consequences. Also, since you asked if people had success at dealing with brain fog and if there was any hope, let me tell you about my last semester of undergrad. My brain fog and other health issues were so bad I barely left my room, and at one point I had to get Dean approval to take two weeks off. The entirety of that two week break, I laid in bed, dozing and staring at a blank wall and thinking of nothing, while Star Trek talked at me in the background 24/7 and my wonderful, amazing housemates brought me food and water. Because I let myself rest, I succeeded in keeping top grades, earning highest honors on my cognitive science undergrad thesis and physics senior research project, getting a paper published on a project unrelated to either major, organizing and running the first ever science conference for undergrads at the United Nations after 2 years of work, winning a competition to shadow the UK-NYC Consul General and UK ambassador to the UN for a few days, and graduating.

11894,"Hey guys! I have recently noticed something weird about my eyes. A little background, I had corrective surgery for esotropia when I was around four years old, I am twenty eight now. The surgery was largely successful and I know I have been very lucky to have not had any major issues since. However, I started taking a new medication a few years back and the medication is known to be a muscle relaxant. I have always had a fear of my esotropia returning for some reason so decided to keep an eye on it (pun not intended but I'll take it.) I did notice that when I purposely put my eyes out of focus my corrected eye goes out to the right by quite a bit. I recently changed medication but it still does it so I guess it has always been a thing and I haven't noticed. I asked my friends and family in fear that my eye does this at other times and people are scared to tell me. The response was a resounding no, nobody has noticed any issues at all except my mother who says sometimes when I'm tired it can drift a little but nothing major. An ex from 10 years ago also confirmed this, said he noticed it but ""it wasn't the end of the world."" I noticed in normal vision my right eye is VERY slightly out but it's very subtle, this has never been mentioned to me at all in my life so it's obviously not an issue. My concerns are: \- Is this something that is likely to get worse as I get older? Or due to the amount of time that has passed is this most likely how it will stay? \- Is this normal for someone in my circumstances? \- IS there anything I need to do about this? Should I get surgery now in case it gets worse or do the risks of surgery outweigh it when it's only subtle for the most part?

11909,"I wouldn't say severe but it has impacted my life drastically. I am currently 21 years old, i was first diagnosed for keratoconus when i was 18, where i was advised that i would need surgery but i'm still in early stages. So i took it lightly not knowing the seriousness of this disease and started my College. I am a Cadet Pilot and we get tested for vision every year and the requirement is a strict 6/6 on either eyes and 20/20 vision on both. Sometime during the course of my training, whenever i closed my right eye, i could see perfectly well, but when i closed my left eye, i couldn't read very well, like shadowed writing and a halo of light. This had me worried and so in 2020 when i used to fly, i was due for my next medical assessment, i was asked to close my right eye and read the alphabets, i was able to read perfectly, but when i was asked to close my left eye and read with the right, i couldn't read the last 2 lines. i was struggling, squinching my eyes, opening them wide open, raising my head, lowering my head, nothing seemed to work, i almost reached the breaking point and had tears in my eyes as my whole career flashed before my eyes, everything that i've dreamt of and worked so hard for is being compromised by this tiny, yet compromising factor. They ran a couple of tests and sat me down, and told me that i needed to search another career. I broke down, it affected me mentally and drove me into depression. I had worked all my life, spent all my money and time and effort, and it just got flushed down the toilet just like that. I frantically asked if there was any situation, to which he replied that it was late and none of the methods would make much difference. As soon as my flying was over, i flew out to see one of the best eyes doctors and got consulted for cross linking on both eyes. It's been 3 months since then and i've been regularly having check ups and there seems to be no drop in eye power, and i consulted for a eye lens fitting and i could somewhat achieve 6/6 vision on both eyes, things are looking up and i'm much better knowing maybe i haven't got it as worse.

11910,"Autoimmune or not? Hi all, I have been suffering for about 5 years (25/m) with still no diagnosis. I am not here looking for a diagnosis but for suggestions as to what I should have doctors look into next as they don't know themselves what to check so I'm trying to figure it out for myself so I can point them in the right direction. The first issue was digestive issues that started around 6 years ago, I have had an endoscopy where they took a biopsy and they said everything looks fine. My stools used to be very loose but the last couple years haven't been too bad, though I still have to use the toilet 5+ times per day (to poop). Then around 5 years ago I had a case of Labrynthitis (inner ear viral infection) and all my other symptoms seemed to start exactly at this time so I'm sure the virus has triggered this (which is why I suspect autoimmune). The symptoms are as follows: Dry mouth Fatigue Neurological decline (memory, problem solving skills have gone to shit) Excessive sweating Derealisation Sensitivity to loud noise Sensitivity to bright light (particularly sunlight) Balance/coordination problems Joint problems (stupid amount of injuries from working out even though I use good form and don't lift heavy) Alcohol intolerance (get drunk much easier and hangovers are 10 times worse than previously, rarely drink more than a pint or 2 now) Wounds take a long time to heal I was also diagnosed with psoriasis and Raynauds at a young age, had what doctors told me was a psoriasis guttate flair recently and it has cleared on my body but my head is still sore/itchy and it's causing bald patches on my scalp. I have had many blood tests in this time, and have been negative for everything except for slightly elevated liver enzymes but I have had both an ultrasound scan and a fibroscan on my liver and everything is fine. Have been tested for T1, T2 and insipdous diabetes, kidney functions, ANA and all were negative. Sjogrens syndrome seems to match my symptoms most closely but my rheumatologist doesn't believe in seronegative Sjogrens so has ruled that out, my blood tests were negative as was a lip biopsy. If anyone can hell I would be forever grateful! ",1

11912,"34m for context quick backstory: my ophthalmologist retired so I got a referral to a new one. The wait time is 3 hours and they have tons of patients. I'm not sure how it is everywhere but my first ophthalmologist appointments were quick and we only saw her. At the new office the doctor will only talk to you for a couple of minutes as he has many patients. So I went in for these headaches I got that first started at my head but then they slowly went to my eyes. They ran tests I came back fine. I've been getting visuals: seeing lines darting across my vision at night, flashes of colored light in the corners of my eyes . I went back the receptionist was slightly unwilling to fit me in for a visit because she said I was just there, I get that but I eventually got the visit. Asked doc a ton of questions he said it's a migraine. Now I'm not using reading glasses but I feel like I can't see properly when I look at my screen? Could this be astigmatism that isn't corrected? I'm tired of going to the office but should I go again? I've seen another ophthalmologist another time in a different office with the same wait time thing who saw me briefly and said it's not a problem. If it is a migraine doesn't that man there's blood flow problems? Sorry for the long post here. ",1
11913,"26M, 5'9"", 140lbs, Canada Ontario. No smoking, drugs, alcohol. Only prior medical history was a penile yeast infection in ~May 2017 for which I took Fluconazole. So this all started almost 3 years ago (April 2018) when I was 24, suddenly one day in the office I get what looks like a [red stye on my left upper eyelid](https://i.imgur.com/2yq7In1. webp). Three days later it disappears and it [begins to turn red](https://i.imgur.com/EMoAgdh. I suspected an infection and got some antibiotics which cleared it up right away until it ran out. Begin to [document everything](https://i.imgur.com/y7mUu60. webp) and suspect it's inflammation, worse so in the left eye but still apparent in both. Several months later finally get an opthalmologist appointment, does a quick dry eye test (using strips under each eyelid) and diagnoses me with dry eye syndrome, prescribes Xiidra which proceedes to work for 2 years (of only taking it once every other day instead of twice daily). Now comes the weird part, I noticed 2 concrete things: 1) Omega 3-6-9 WILL override the Xiidra (even using twice daily) and cause terrible inflammation, taking Omega 3 alone is completely fine, and; 2) just recently donated blood and shortly after noticed eyes weren't as inflammated, I've now gone 3 weeks without Xiidra whereas before the donation it was still inflammated when briefly pausing the drops for 2-3 days. Eyes are still red like in the 2nd pic but no where near as bad and only need lubricants once or twice a day (mostly in the morning). If anyone's got any incite into possible causes of this I'd greatly appreciate it! Possibly unrelated but I suspect it could be contributing to more general health issues, mainly I seemed to have given myself whiplash symptoms (from strained suboccipital/SCM) from exercising (bench presses and curls) and my neck/shoulders had a burning sensation (possibly inflammation) and had restless leg syndrome before it happened.

11917,"I appreciate your help with anything you can give me. Even if it's just a referral to another person. I'll chase it down! I am in a quandary. I have never worn glasses because I needed to, just because they helped me read at a distance while driving. I see just fine in the day and the majority of things at night without them. They help with nighttime reading at a distance for small details. In my opinion, I see fine. No ghosting, no seeing double, no issues focusing, no halos, no streaking, no bent (straight) lines. At a distance at night, finer details are much better with glasses on, but that is really it. I am trying to join the service as a pilot and I passed the initial exam for correction 20/20, no colorblindness, no depth issues, and a prescription within tolerance. I, being my proactive minded self, went to get my eyes evaluated for LASIK because I knew I had astigmatism. This is when I had my first corneal topography done. The nurse said I had irregular astigmatism (she believed I have Keratoconus (KC)) and I needed to see the ophthalmologist. \*Caveat here, KC isn't just disqualifying for a pilot slot, but for joining the military altogether. The only position in all of the military that requires a corneal topography is pilot\* Fast forward a few weeks to the doctor's visit. The doc is very well respected and the only corneal specialist in my area. I believe his words to me were something like ""I am giving you a very liberal diagnosis with your topography scans as an 'irregular astigmatism' and the fact that you are easily correctable to 20/20. If I were to diagnose you with KC, it will follow you forever, which is not what I want for you if you can still get in the service with a different position if they don't do the scans. I fear a military Ophthalmologist may not see you the same way I do and write you off with KC and you can never get in, not just as a pilot. You might go about a happy career with 0 issues, or they have you get corneal cross-linking done later on if it were to become an issue and that's it. Many pilots have it and never know until they are 40 and they finally find it.""<U+009D> I just don't want to give up on my dream or a chance to get there is a possibility. I feel like he was doing me a favor by not giving me the KC label to get in. I have already been selected for a pilot do to my scores, so I need to make a decision to accept or decline for a different position ASAP. I have attached my most recent scans, recent measurements.

Lubricating eye drops (not the redness relief ones) help significantly reduce the floaters and grey area when I remember to use them regularly. Otherwise continue to see an ophthalmologist at least yearly and make sure you're getting a dilated eye exam when you do, and I'm sure everything will be okay. ",1

About 40% of it goes away when wearing glasses. When I blink, the pattern of the aberrations change and it goes away under a pinhole. The aberrations decrease under bright light but it doesn't fully go away. I'm going to a new doctor soon to look for contacts as my glasses don't correct it as much as I want them too. I came across rigid gas permeable lenses and wonder if these would be an option for me. As stated previously, I'm fairly new to this and have never worn contacts before. I want to start wearing rgp's as they are cheaper than scleral and hybrid lenses. My astigmatism isn't that bad although I see multiple. Will the lenses correct all of these aberrations?

11922,"Hi all. I am in my mid 30ies, I believe my keratoconus was diagnosed in my teenage years, when CXL wasn't a thing yet. My mother has KCN, too, but apparently it never progressed as fast as mine: 12 years ago, I had a (DALK) cornea transplant in my right eye. Left eye remained stable for the next ten years, and now changed a little because I decided to get epi-on CXL (that's another long story). Back in the day, as soon as they saw the KCN was getting really bad, they just gave me the usual ""get RGP lenses"" spiel. That's what I did, and I hated them. Even got an infection on my right eye because of the RGP scracting the cornea. Not long after, the transplant happened, and I stopped wearing them alltogether. Some time after, an optician suggested I should try soft toric lenses. Actually, they worked pretty well. On my transplanted eye, I got 8/10, on my KCN eye 10/10. Wow! In general, my eyes are pretty sensitive, and I have to say, even with soft contacts I couldn't wear them all day. I had my tricks, like: morning with glasses, as soon as the eyes get too tired (because of the strain of working in front of a monitor), switch to contacts. Sometimes if I went out in the afternoon and came back at night, I would them on before going out, and late at night my eyes would get so dry, no matter how many eye drops I would put. But aside from these issues, the soft toric lenses served me well. Now my (vertical) coma got really bad on my left eye after CXL, and wanted to try sclerals. I have a few questions for you guys: \- does anybody wear sclerals on the graft? How long can you wear it? I read online how the hypoxia from the scleral (even with very very high DK, and with a thin reservoir) can cause problems to the graft. I have a beautiful DALK that served me well for the latest 12 years, and even if vision is not ""optimal"", I think it's still better than risking graft rejection. What is your experience? \- what about KCN? Did anybody try PROSE and EyePrint Pro? These seem like the ""best"" brands doing custom sclerals. How do they fare? How would you compare them to hybrid lenses? Thanks in advance for sharing your experience! ",0
11923,"Yeah I can understand that, and a good optometrist should be able to take the time to talk to you about your fears.

11924,"I'm an optician that currently wears Hoya's Sync and have had Essilor's Eyezen previously in their lowest available powers. My Rx is -6.00ish total power with -0.75 cyl in OS, in my early 30s. I suspect I have a +0.75 ish add since my older pairs with that difference in prescription are more comfortable for me to read with, though I haven't actually had my reading specifically tested yet. To me, they're both more like boosters instead of an actual bifocal/multifocal. I don't notice any unusual distortion and it feels like a regular single vision except reading is a little more comfortable through the lower portion of the lens in comparison to the center or compared to glasses without the boost. 0.37-0.5 is so minimal though, it'd likely be more noticeable with the higher boosts available but I just haven't personally tried them yet. The boost is barely noticeable in the smallest frame I have, which is about a 27 height and my eyes are vertically centred in. It's fine for me but you'd probably want something with a little more space if it's a higher boost so they can actually use it. I have found that patients in the mid-higher range power boost transitioned to using office lenses/ full progressives easier. ",0
11925,"Sounds exactly like my situation 7 years ago. I've continued to find a way in. Because everything I'm interested in for a careers stems from the military. However. At 25 I got 5 more years to figure it out. Rn I work as a police officer. So I can speak as to reasons why I 100% understand they don't want KC in the military. With RGP or Sclerals. You are simply a risk. A huge risk. Say infantry as a somewhat extreme example. If you have you sclerals on in the gas chamber. You're eyes are not gonna be happy, if you lose the lense. You're screwed and useless to them. If it cracks in your eye (has happened to me) you're not only screwed but now your medic is acting as on optometrist trying to remove that lense from your eye. Now that exaggerated example is over. I do think they should relax KC restrictions as plenty of non contact lense options are very very close to being ""cures (not including transplant) but MEPS code simply states. KC of any degree is disqualifying. I fell where you're coming from I do. I was just looking at BSing my way through again hoeing they wouldn't catch it. But that would be selfish of me and for what I want to do in the military sub par vision just doesn't cut it. Running a night op (and KC under night vision is an absolute disaster I've tried) with me using flex lenses. I could fail to identify a threat and my buddy gets shot. That not ideal. But I won't be a dude that holds my team back because I wanna do something. Even in my current PD I won't go SWAT because of that exact reason. My vision isn't there for it. I can shoot in the 99th percentile in Georgia. But that's more of a training through it type of thing. Doesn't meat I can reliably and safely operate around dudes with 20/20 vision with no risk of contact issues. KC dudes are just more at risk. I've had issues my PD. I've chased dudes and my contact blurs out. I've run code to a med call and they blur out. I feel you. I do. But sometimes we have to accept our limitations for the sake of our lives or others. However I do think they should make exceptions if you can see 20/20 in glasses. Regardless of how you got there ðŸ˜Ž (talking prolly $25000 in procedures). ",1
11926,"My ophthalmologist, who is a world renowned KC researcher, said that KC usually stops in your 40s. I think mine progressed in my mid-30s but that was also the time that corneal topography was just becoming available so it may have also been that the ability to measure my progression became available in my mid-30s. So I wouldn't let your guard down just because you are in your 30s. My belief is that anyone with KC should have at least annual eye exams. I do agree that if you are in your 30s you probably should have CXL only if active progression of your KC is observed at your eye exams. Depending on your history, a few exams at 3 to 6 month intervals might be prudent. ",0

The doctor said it would be really hard to get used to the glasses but I'm surprisingly doing well, no headaches or anything.

It's all oval or trapzoid shaped. With glasses, things appear wider than normal and without glasses much longer and narrower. The doctor said I have keratoconus, but it's in the beggining stages.

Preface: I have mild irregular astigmatism so I always have at least a tiny bit blurring and double vision even at my best lens fitting.

The new Rx is pretty close, and it's the closest I get to equal clarity on the duochrome test, but it's still pretty blurry and ghosting/doubled. My best vision seems to be slightly stronger than the home test Rx. This is what I got when I refracted myself: OD: -1.5 SPH, -2.25 cyl at 96 OS: -2 SPH, -1.5 cyl at 77 The duochrome test with this in my trial lenses is very slightly green, flipping to an almost unnoticeable red preference when I add +.25.

It was dumb. I was incredibly lucky and was told I was literally millimetres away from blinding myself. It healed fine, and I just had to use eye drops for a couple of weeks. Now, flash forward to five weeks ago. I'm now 33yo and wear glasses. I have considerably worse vision in my left eye (I don't have my actual prescription to hand). Five weeks ago I woke up to find that I had floaters in my left eye. A dark line at the lower left hand periphery and a horseshoe shaped floater slightly off-centre at the top of my vision. The floaters didn't disappear for three weeks, and despite google and my boyfriend telling me that floaters were a normal part of ageing, something didn't feel right. Anyway (and stick with me here. I know it's getting convoluted). I went to the optician. He diagnosed me with a retinal tear and immediately sent me to A&E. the A&E doc wasn't sure whether he was seeing a retinal tear or my old injury, so he referred me to a consultant in the eye hospital. This consultant immediately diagnosed me with a retinal tear within 10 mins of looking on my eye. He even had a student doctor come in and take a look, and there was lots of talk about my ""retinal flap and how it looked like there was cigarette ash in my eye (rude). So I had laser retinopexy to fix the tear. And my vision has definitely improved. My horseshoe floater has definitely faded slightly and my dark peripheral vision seems to have come back a bit (not totally). Although I'm now getting a blur across the vision in my left eye multiple times a day (not constant blurred vision). Things seem to have improved though. Except, when I went for my checkup yesterday, a different consultant told me he can't see any tear within my eye, but he could see a lot of inflammation in the area that I'm seeing the dark line in my peripheral vision. He had two other consultants come in to look (the word granuloma was thrown around a lot), and then he told me he thinks I have ocular toxoplasmosis. I had an OCT scan, an eye ultrasound and bloods taken, and I'll apparently be seen within three days of my appointment (which was yesterday) to get the results and potentially begin treatment. But, guys, I am Freaking Out. The consultant was just woeful at giving me any real info on the condition, and everything I've found online is super filled with medical jargon. I just really need someone who has ocular toxoplasmosis to tell me what tf is going on. Halp. TLDR: i had laser eye surgery when I didn't need laser eye surgery, because I apparently don't have a retinal tear but I do have ocular toxoplasmosis. Wtf. ",1
11935,"Sorry I don't mean to sound like a dick but this is a common misconception. These are not 'your' measurements. I find people often get confused about this, saying things like 'I'm a 52' etc. The only way to find out if a frame fits is to try it on. Even understanding what the numbers mean isn't much help. For example, a frame with an 18 bridge may fit fine as a metal but as a thick acetate it may be far too small on your nose. A 140 side may be fine as a skull grip frame but not a hockey tip frame. Etc etc A frame might fit but might be too low/too high with reference to your eyebrows. Or it might touch your cheeks when you smile. Lots of little details that the measurements won't tell you.

But more so after removing all plant matter. I do suspect dairy to trigger me around ovulation time til my period hits. My eyes start feeling a little sandy and my mouth gets dry. I just avoid cheese during this time. Easy enough. I add in more fats during this time too. I can take day time naps up to 3 hours without my eye gel. It is so liberating! I use it at night out of an intense fear of having my corneas ripped upon waking. Yuck! It might be worth thinking about the AIP diet, or at least an elimination diet.

11950,Let me preface This and say I promise I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I wanted lasik my whole life and always heard such good things about it. I monitored friends and people in my own family for years to see the effects and everyone seemed alright. December 11 I made the worst decision of my life and had the procedure done. I went to the best doctor in Houston and for the newest wavefront Contoura technology done. Every day since I regret that decision. Please under stand there is a conspiracy from the Lasik industry and FDA to hide the true costs of Lasik. First there is no way for the doctor to truly know if you are a good candidate or not. They left form the procedure the same for everyone. Yes may be adjusted for near sighted/ farsightedness and astigmatism. But the doctors glaze over what they are really doing. Understand this when they make the incision on your flap whether blameless or with blade they are severing nerves on your eyes. Your eyes have the most nerves and most intense feeling of any place on your body. The doctors who cut nerves are not neurologist. They understand the surface or they eye and that's it. They expect the nerves will grow back perfectly but have NO way to know if and when and if something goes wrong they cannot see the nerves because they are microscopic. Please reeearch something called corneal neuralgia on YouTube and reddit as well as on google. It happens when the nerves on your eyes do not grow back correctly and you are left with chronic debilitating pain. There have been multiple people who commit suicide because the pain is so intense there are stories on google please search. Also when they cut your nerves they disrupt the cycle your eye has to keep the eye moist and safe. I understand you may think of dry eye as oh I will just put drops in. No! You could be left with sever dry eye that never goes away. Right now I am dealing with that. Doctors said I was perfect candidate and my eye would not have issues. The dry eye feels as if someone poured gasoline on my eyes and set it on fire. It feels this way constantly. I cannot even sleep because of the pain and there is no way to know if it's temporary. Please understand you have one set of eyes and if something goes wrong (it is not extremely rare there are hundreds of thousands of people who develop issues fro lasik some right after some 30 years later) there is no surgery to fix your eyes. They are ruined and destroyed and you will have to live with that forever. Knowing you chose that. Also FACT ppl who have lasik are at risk of developing cataracts up to 15 years earlier than normal. Not only that but your cataract surgery is more at risk of complication because of your mutilated cornea from lasik. Not only that you cannot even have the newest lens they use for cataract because of your mutiliated cornea. Is it really worth it? Would you be able to forgive yourself if something went wrong? It can happen at any time after lasik I have talked to people who get Weber dryness or pain or vision loss at 20 years after lasik? Please when you see scientist and top doctors are they not all wearing glasses?? Do not fall prey to the trap. Every day I convince myself to commit Suicide because my life has been stolen from me by lasik doctors. I had so many dreams but now I only exist so my family does not mourn me. I beg you to not make that mistake. I can prove everything I've told you if you want to know. Please go to lasikcomplications.com. Please listen to people who have had issues. Yes there are many ppl with no immediate problems but many develop them later and again there is no solution. Save yourself please. ,0

So one, am I the only one, who despite telling them my symptoms of joint pain and inflammation are pretty severe was told that joint pain is one of the lesser common symptoms? The PA basically told me that Sjogrens is mostly just dry mouth and eyes. She also said I had to see the eye doctor before she would put me on medication. There is no other Rheumatologist close, so this is my only option at the moment, but I'm not impressed. Two, for the dry mouth she told me it's good to chew sugar free gum or suck on sugar free candy. I do chew gum sometimes, but it kind of makes my jaw hurt.

11960,"Thanks for reading this and helping my mind be put at ease. Back in September of 2020 I went to my annual check up my glasses prescription change from L:-2.25 Cyl:2.00 Axis:159 R:-2.75 Cyl:1.50 Axis:006 to L:2.50 Cyl:2.25 Axis:159 R:-3.25 Cyl:1.50 Axis:006. I try that prescription for about three weeks but I felt dizzy, got big headaches and didn't feel quite right. I went back to my optometrist and after much deliberation she agree to let me stay with my old prescription since I was seeing a little blurry from it, but I was still in the 20/20 range. Fast forward to February of this year I started to get big headaches on the right side of my head with eye pain and my vision was blurry while looking at far away. I couldn't read street signs anymore until I was closed to them. Naturally I went to see my optometrist again, she did all the test and was determine I had dry eyes, but everything else was find, she referred me to a dry eye clinic and that was the end of it. I wasn't able to get in to the dry eye clinic until the beginning of April. In the meantime the headaches, eye pain and blurry vision was still there. I went to two other optometrist and after performing all the test, the same diagnosis was giving that I had dry eyes and to wait for my appointment with the dry eye clinic. When I was finally able to be seeing at the clinic I was told I had MGD, but also I had bilateral anterior uveitis. I was treated with Lotemax at first for the uveitis, but the treatment didn't work and after two weeks the inflammation remain the same, so I was change to prednisolone every two hours with Timolol gel because I was a steroid responder. IOP before steroids was 10 in both eyes and IOP after steroids was L:17 R:21. Suffix to say after a month of treatment my optometrist try to temper me off the pred, but since she did it too fast my inflammation came back with a vengeance and my IOP shot up to L:25 R:36 and that was the highest it has ever got to. I was refer to an Uveitis specialist and I started seeing her at the end of May in the meantime I was told to continue using the pred every two hours and I was switch to Combigan to lower my IOP. The combigan kind of work because it did lower my IOP, but it was still high hanging at L:17 R:23 to 26 every time I was check. After seeing the specialist it was confirm I had anterior uveitis, but also intermediate uveitis. The inflammation has always been between a 0.5 to a 1 even when it was first discover so the Specialist was not to concern about it. She say I have a very mild case and all of my symptoms are due to my high IOP. She told me I could start tempering down from the pred and we start off with a very slow temper right now I'm currently using the pred 3 x a day with along with the Combigan drops and Dorzamilane to help lower my IOP. This past Monday during a follow up visit my Doc gave me the ok to get a new glasses prescription since everything look stable. She did mention I was a low risk glaucoma suspect giving my IOP was high for three months, but she told me she is not worry about it since an OCT test show everything was fine except for a C/D of 0.5 of both eyes which she thinks I was born with it like that. After the visit I have a habit of reading her notes in my chart and I found out I also have vitreomacular adhesion on both eyes, but she didn't mention, so I'm also looking for clarification on what exactly is that. I'm a 31 year old male who had never had any health problems before my uveitis. Every year I would get an eye exam and everything look good. I had been tested for everything under the sun, I had three MRI's and a ct scan that shows I'm perfectly healthy except for the fact I had Idiopathic Uveitis, I'm a glaucoma suspect and I had vitreomacular adhesion on both eyes. Yesterday, I finally went to get my eye exam and to my optometrist surprise I went from L:-2.25 Cyl:2.00 Axis:159 R:-2.75 Cyl:1.50 Axis:006 to L:-3.25 Cyl:1.25 Axis:165 R:-4.00 Cyl:1.50 Axis:006. I was surprised and worry at the same time so I asked her if it was normal to go up in prescription that quickly in under a year and her explanation was it could but that's it. Reddit I need your help because frankly I have a few questions about all of these that is happening to me. I have a extreme fear of going blind that gets worse with me having OCD. Is it normal to have big of a prescription change in less than a year? Could it be cause by all the drops I'm currently taking? What exactly is vitreomacular adhesion and is it dangerous? and Finally what can I do if anything to stop my prescription from changing or from developing Glaucoma from the steroid drops that I'm using at the moment? FYI: The inflammation is still there and it is stable at 0.5 the doc says it would remain there and hopefully in the near future it will go away on it's own since the steroids doesn't seem to be able to completely quiet my eyes down. The inflammation is too mild to try other medications because according to my doc the risk outweigh the rewards especially when my inflammation is this mild. Thank You. ",1

11963,"About 4 months ago I had a pretty bad headache and noticed my pupils were uneven. I had gotten 2 hrs of sleep the night before, had an 8 hr shift and then a 3 hr night class so I kinda just ignored it and blamed it on exhaustion/staring at screens. Both of my pupils were reactive to light, but the smaller pupil seemed to ""lag""<U+009D> in dim lighting and wouldn't get as dilated as the other one but would still dilate a decent amount. I then began to notice it any time I was extremely exhausted and had a headache so decided I needed to fix my sleep and I stopped noticing it for awhile. But now it's come back and it's much more consistent. It usually isn't accompanied by a headache now, but I've noticed the eyelid of the constricted eye is droopy. I just started grad school so I'm definitely more overworked, underfed, and dehydrated but I still get 5-7 hours of sleep a night.

11964,"# Introduction Hi all, I'm a Chinese student studied in Germany currently. I have been disturbed by dry eyes syndrom from a very long time, 8 years approximately since I bought my first laptop. I work in the software industry. Needless to say, my daily screen time easily exceeds 8 hours. So, it's a simple truth that if you have dry eyes then quit facing screens for such a long time. Every doctor says that, and everyone knows that, but that's something out of our control. Computer is a productivity tool for people like me, I can't quit my job and go live in a mountain, right? I thought Asians are more prone to suffer from dry eyes, I once read a statistic report about that. Anyway, I'll just cut my crap and share what me (and people I know with similar problems) have already found out. # Diagnose ##. Self Diagnose First of all, you should know the current condition of your eyes. Here is a very simple way to diagnose yourself. According to severity of eyes' condition, the symptoms can be categorized into 3 levels: 1. Light: You can read real paper book (or newspaper, magazine, anything like that) for as long time as you want. You doesn't feel a thing while reading. But you eyes are feeling difficult while using a mobile phone or work in front of a screen monitor. 2. Medium: Hours of book reading make your eyes tired. Not to mention screen monitors. 3. Severe: Even openning your eyes is difficult. You want to secrete more tears but no, there is just no tears in eyes, not if you yawn or cry. You especially hate windy weather outside, because it leads to your sore and painful eyes. Guys, I'm not here to terrify you, there symptoms are what actually happened between us. And don't be desperate, I'm here to spread my experience. ## Hospital Diagnose You can also go to hospital, there are a bunch of machines made for this. I guess it won't costs much. In China, it costs roughly 50 dollars (Chinese yuan converted to USD). With the help of machines, you'll get a report and some data about your eye condition: 1. How long can your tear film lasts each time you close and reopen your eyes? 2. What is the amount of tear you have in your eyes? 3. Did you eye glands that secrete tears shrink or becoming distorted? These information is helpful, at least you need to know what happened to your eyes. Sorry for the amateur description, I'm not familiar with medical terms, especially in English. # Do's and don'ts ##. What to do? You can of course go to see the doctor, and often times you will have to try many doctors. In China, it seems that there is no mature way to cure dry eyes. What the eye doctor will do is let you try several kinds of eyedrops, and they often don't work well. Remember, if you are using any kind of eyedrops, just make sure they are absolutely preservative free. Also there are some mini-scale surgeries like SmartPlug and Lipiflow, they are quite more expensive than eyedrops. As far as I know these surgeries are not that helpful, but you can talk with your doctors and know more. I can roughly explain most of methods eye doctors would use, how does it work and why it's not so useful etc. But let's just move on to next paragraph, because I don't really have a positive attitude toward these methods. I don't know if there are different approaches used by doctors in western countries, so don't entirely take my words before ask the doctor for help. The most valuable thing you can do is to limit your screen time. I know there are factors other than screen that cause dry eyes, yes I know, but as long as you already have dry eyes symdrom then quit using screen should improve your condition instantly. The second valuable thing is doing exercises, outdoor exercises are better. The third is sleeping enough. Other things like quit masterbating or get some xanthophyll and eat fresh foods might help or might not, I don't know. Three things above are proved to work well. ## Don't do! 1. Don't use any screen or mobile phone in a dark room! 2. Don't get stick to the screen while your eyes are already shouting out loud: HELP! 3. Don't use any eyedrops contain preservative! 4. Don't try any eye surgeries before fully informed by doctors! # Silver bullet Is there a silver bullet, like it can cure it all? The answer is yes and no. ## Yes, there is a silver bullet Here comes the most important part of this post. A simple truth, what harms your eyes is the light source. It's not about the screen per se, it's the light source that lit the screen. So, if you are using kindle to read books, it should be quite comfortable for you eyes. Reading E-ink paper WITHOUT turning on its back light is just as reading real paper. What's the problem with iPhones, laptops, screen monitors? It's the LED inside the screen that harms our eyes. As far as I know there is only one another type of screen that doesn't have led: RLCD screens. RLCD screens are often used in outdoor advertisement. The problems with E-ink are the low refresh rate and limited color display. E-ink screen is just not acceptable if you are using it to work or do any kind of serious learning. What we have found out is to remove the LED inside the screen monitor and use natural light as the light resource to lit the screen. It's not easy to do, but you'll get familiar after you have one or two experience dismantling it. Not all screen monitors are good for this, make sure it uses a TN panel, not IPS, not VA, not OLED, it should be TN. TN panel has better transparency. Don't be scared, indoor lighting using LED won't harm, as long as the light doesn't directly shot into your eyes (like while you're using screens) then it should be fine. ## No, there is no silver bullet After you remove all harmful light source from screens, your eyes should make big improvement. But are they cured? Sorry, the answer is a no. For people have level 3 symptoms, you still need to rest your eyes as much as possible. I don't have a strict rule for everyone, just don't overuse it. Things like sleeping and doing exercises are big pluses to your eyes, things like overusing your eyes, especially using normal LED lit screens are big minuses to your eyes. Increase more pluses and decrease more minuses, then you should get through this fucking tricky disease, even WITHOUT using any drugs or surgeries. If your eyes just feel really dried up, you can use HYLO tear drop or use a hot towel to very lightly touch you eyes. --- Here we should put a period to this post, I think it's just already so long. I know there are many details I didn't expand into, so if you have any questions please leave comments below, I'll check regularly and see if I can help. ",0
11965,"Hello. My left eye sees worse than the right one and I barely see anything on computer screens without glasses. I'm using computers extensively. The thing with the left eye seeing worse is there because when I was little, I found a photo camera and played with the flash too much - it damaged my vision. If I don't use special computer glasses (expensive ones, with this violet-like glass), then my eyes get tired very quickly. It used to be so bad I couldn't look at a laptop without eye pain for more than 30 minutes. Nowadays it's not so bad when I use those glasses but I have to turn down the brightness nearly to a minimum. Do you think laser correction could help me with this issue with brightness? Or does it just improve how far I can see? I've already done some small surgery which helped me a little bit. I can try to find my diagnosis but basically the surgery was to fix these small ""snow drops"" that I see. Not sure how to explain. They had me looking at a dot and corrected my retina. ",0
11966,"I have struggled with insomnia for the last ten years, although it would be somewhat sporadic and especially get bad around my cycle. Through sleep hygiene and supplements I have had it mostly under control and slept well during 2020 when I was unemployed. However, now I am working full time (on the computer) and have been dealing with severe dry eye symptoms for the last 6 months, my sleep is absolutely wrecked. Especially in the last month. I only get 3 maybe 4 hours of sleep. Then I have middle of the night freakouts and I can't calm down. Because I know my body needs sleep in order for my eyes to heal. It's a viscous cycle. My normal sleep stack of mag glycinate, deep sleep herbal formula and melatonin just don't work anymore. Yesterday eve, I felt really calm. Had a nice yoga session after work, took a shower, made a cup of tea, listened to audio books. I felt calm and sleepy but when I try to sleep I get these surges of adrenaline my skin feels hot and rubbery. I've also been doing sleep restriction technique which had worked well for me in the past but not anymore.

11967,"Yes, he also said the same - that he hasn't seen any patients or heard of the vaccine possibly causing this. He did say that he has heard of cases where people developed this condition after contracting COVID-19. However, there are properties of COVID-19 in the vaccine hence your body building up immune properties to fight the virus so he couldn't rule out that there is a possibility it was indeed due to an adverse reaction. If it's not then it's just an extreme coincidence and I fall under the idiopathic category I guess. I'm really scared because I am young (33yr old), healthy and haven't had any vision issues in the past. I ride mountain bikes a lot and it's really affecting me because my depth perception is totally skewed. I hope that the retina specialist has good news or something hopeful to say next week.

11968,Most astigmatism is horizontal or vertical from what i was told. Oblique is the worst and from what i understand cannot be corrected to 20/20 or at least with KC. Thanks for your reply. ,0

11970,"I have dealt with redness in the eyes ever since I was 18. I am now 36. I used to see it in both eyes, but the last few years I have only had it in my right eye. It's only on the exposed cornea on the inside corner of my eye, but sometimes it'll be red on the outside. It does seem like that eye is dryer than the other, but I only have very mild discomfort and it doesn't itch. I normally wouldn't post on here, but I have literally seen countless eye doctors over the years. Every visit turns out the same. They do a thorough exam and find no signs of infection or any issues whatsoever. So each one gives up and prescribes something like Zylet or Alrex. I usually use it for a few days only and symptoms disappear for months then eventually come back. Most doctors assume it's some allergy. I've tried changing soaps, detergents, everything. Being outside seems to make it better some. Lubricant drops help for a few minutes but no more. I've tried fish oil, multiple diet changes, and anything I could think of. It definitely seems worse the less sleep I get. If I can get a ridiculous amount of sleep, like 10 hours, it almost completely goes away, but that's near impossible to get that much sleep. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time. ",1

11976,"I was like that until my last 2 fittings. My left eye had a new prescription filled in January, and the fittings for it have been a little tighter than usual, but on the whole I only feel it when I hard blink. They both feel dry and fuzzy by 9 or 10 PM no matter how often I take them off and refill them, so I think at that point my eyes are sensitive and need rest. ",0
11977,Most likely your prescription had already changed and you didn't notice until you were without your glasses for twelve hours resting your eye. ,0
11978,"I don't want to overwrite your doctor, especially because I'm a 3rd year student and absolutely lack the expertise he/she has. Here is my opinion nonetheless... And it would be easier to give you an answer if you specified which eye was feeling these effects... the right one, or both? I'm guessing it's just the right eye thats giving you trouble, yes? If not, disregard the rest... For an eye with +6.50 - 0.50 x 120 ...I probably wouldn't even touch that cyl and just give you the sphere (like your doctor did). But if you *do* in fact need it, then my next guess would be that the lens is rotating on your eye. Every time you blink, the contact lens' ballast/orientation mechanism is rotating it to the correct axis, and then it drifts off again a second or so later. This is probably super difficult, but if you have a magnifying glass (and a flashlight) and you have really keen sight, try to find that inferior marking on your contact lens while wearing it in front of a mirror. See if it isn't in the same spot right after blinking, and a few seconds later. A total longshot, but can't hurt to try. If you're committed to having contact lenses and can't get any soft ones to work, then you can always try RGPs. ",0
11979,"Just wanted to provide an update in case anyone cares. I'm 25 and I got CXL in one of my eyes so far. 1. Vision has gone back to baseline, or very close at least. I would say 95% if its not 100% yet. 2. One side-effect that I still have is haze. Nothing extreme but noticeable in certain conditions with high contrast. It's only been 3 months but im hoping the haze goes away in due time. 3. Also I noticed starbursts coming from light sources, I'm hoping this goes away as well. 4. Dryness has gotten better and I've been using less drops as the months go by. So overall, vision is not bad at all, but some slight haze that I'm praying goes away in time, if anyone else has experience with CXL and can comment on the haze please let me know if I should be worried.

11981,"To start out I am 32 and have never had glasses before. I had 20/15 vision prior to being dilated. I recently found out I am hyperopic and need a prescription of +6 in my left eye and +3 in my right eye. My optometrist opted to start out with glasses approximately half strength. I ended up getting fitted for +2.5 and +1. I know it takes a while to adjust to glasses but I am always dizzy if I'm moving and get nauseous pretty easy, especially if I'm looking around at things (ie grocery shopping). My distance vision is definitely worse than it used to be. I have a fish lense view and I struggle to change my focus from near to far and vice versa. I'm wondering how long is normal to wait for things to level out? Could it possibly be that my eyes want to fully relax and I should up my prescription or is it because it was a big jump from nothing? Also, when I take my glasses off to shower I loose my balance because one eye can accommodate again and one is blurry, haha does this level out? Thanks for the help! I also want to get prescription sunglasses so I'm trying to guess how long I would stay at this prescription? I'm outside in the sun a lot and definitely need something. ",1
11982,thanks for you useful reply. Can an a optometrist detect early on if a high myope is likely to experience issues or not? I'm now 30 and my optometrist always tells me that my retina is healthy. She also advised that macular degeneration is very unlikely for myself as my macular is also in good condition. Is this true? Does complications related to high myopia always lead to legal blindness or are many complications treatable? ,1
11983,"\+1.50 in one eye, +0.75 the other, reading add of +1.50 (progressive glasses). Age mid 40s. Most recent eye exam was about four months ago. No change in Rx for the past 2.5 years. I notice however that I'm usually under-corrected for distance. As these are progressive glasses, this is apparent by looking at distance through a lower area in my glasses. Just curious if there's anything I can say to an optometrist at next appointment to avoid this scenario from happening again in the future, as this is the 2nd occurrence. i.e. is it possible or even advisable to just add another +0.25 to distance, both eyes??

11984,"Hey all. I'm just here looking for some tips and advice. I've always had good vision. Not AMAZING but good. I didn't have glasses until my early 20s and it was just for a slight astigmatism. However, since I started my current job, Im looking at 2 monitors for 10 hours a day 5 days a week.. plus my phone for emails etc ...and now with COVID and living in Canada, I wasn't able to go outside much so I played a lot of video games, watched a lot of movies etc. Luckily the weather is getting nicer and I can be outside and off screen more but my vision feels like it's gotten SO bad. I can't believe how bad it is. I now wear my glasses all the time and it's STILL blurry. I have a blue light filter on my lenses. I have this thing that adjusts the light on my screens, but wow. I cannot believe how bad it is. Eye docs are booked up till June but I have an appointment. I'm just wondering what I can do in the mean time to help combat this? ",0

11991,"Around 3 years ago, I saw a ""flash"" in my left eye. This was on the right side of my left-eye's field of vision, about half-a-centimetre to the right from the centre of the Amsler Grid and, and maybe 1/4 of a centimetre down. When this calmed down a bit, it became a bit like a camera flash after-image which didn't go away, so I went to Specsavers and was referred to the eye unit at a nearby hospital. They performed the full range of scans; a visual field test, something which involved laser-scanning my retina, simply looking at the problem with my eyes dilated... As I was in my mid-30s, the doctor was really trying to convince me this problem was a floater, but I was pretty sure it wasn't as the problem was ""fixed"" (it moved in perfect tandem with the movement of my eye, no drift). Still, the nature of the tests they did meant they strongly believed I hadn't suffered a retinal tear or detatchment. After much examination, the doctor said they believed I was suffering from a mild form of PVD, and that I should keep aware of it and only come back if the problem got worse. They said I should avoid anything which would ""jar"" my head for a few months, so stuff like intense exercise or rollercoasters and the like, but that I should expect this as I got older, and it *should* get better over time (though could take months). It's now maybe 3 years later, and I can still see the mark in my eye. It's definitely less noticeable than it once was (like I have to drift my eye across the correct light conditions to see it, like if I drift it over the scrollbar at the edge of a computer screen) and it has become smaller, but it's still there - and it hasn't really changed since maybe a year after it first appeared. I had a scare recently where I saw another mark in the same eye, but I'm having sinus pains after a recent bout of flu and fortunately this didn't stay. Still, it's made me super-conscious of this. However, when I look up PVD symptoms online, such as here... [https://www.rnib.org.uk/eye-health/eye-conditions/posterior-vitreous-detachment](https://www.rnib.org.uk/eye-health/eye-conditions/posterior-vitreous-detachment) ... they generally say that PVD symptoms should pretty much disappear within a few months, and this has remained. I can live with it, but it's really annoying. Sometimes I'm reading text and my eye is drawn to it, like it looks like a letter further along the page is smudged. I write as a major part of my profession so you can see why this might be irritating. It's also worrying living with the constant fear of it getting worse. I get nightmares of waking up one morning and my whole vision is covered in them. Anyway, if anyone can offer advice, I'd much appreciate it. Should I go back to the eye hospital and suggest they examine me again? ",0
11992,"Hi all, I found out in March that I have Keratoconus (one of my parents does as well) after my vision in my right eye drastically reduced over the past year and I went to the eye doctor to get a new glasses prescription (I'm in my late 20s). The eye doc was unable to get me back to 20/20 vision even with lenses, but I feel pretty lucky that I can see/read fairly well still, at least during the day. However, I've noticed my vision get worse even just since March. I wonder if the increased amount of screen time from working from home, etc. during quarantine could have played a role? Regardless, it's made me realize I need to prioritize seeing a specialist and potentially pursue CXL. So my question - how did you all go about choosing your specialist? I'm in Philadelphia so I should have a number of options (I could also pursue treatment in Houston where my family is based), but I'm a bit overwhelmed after an initial round of searching. Are there any specific questions you asked, such as whether they had done many CXL procedures in the past? Is there some sort of eye-specific directory I could start with? And did anyone's insurance pay for any of this at all, or should I plan to handle this all out of pocket? Thanks for any insight or advice you might have! As I'm sure you've all experienced, this is overwhelming to wrap your head around at first. Appreciate this community for sure. ",0
11993,"I would say get treatment ASAP. If some piece is still in there that's irritating you, it needs to be checked. I had a contact lense reaction that ended up in an ulcer. I'm not saying that's what you have, just that it can get bad quickly. Your eyes are really not worth risking. Depending on where you live call your gp or national health line for advice on where to go. In the UK it would be NHS 24, but I don't know where you live so check what's available. ",0

My kerataconus is at a severely advanced stage and I have been dealing with it for over 13 years since I have been diagnosed. I won't get into details, but I had an unbearable loss of a very close family member 2 years ago, and to this day I am struggling with depression and PTSD from it. My kerataconus is only debilitating on top of it all, to the point where I am having extreme bouts of pain regularly to irritation from my scleral lenses I must wear to able to see at all, or have any normality in life. And 2020 has only exaggerated my situation more. I'm not saying this to scare you or make you feel worse about the future but I feel like that is the only way I am going to sound regardless. All I am trying to say is that I get what you are going through and I wish nothing but the best for you. Speaking from personal experience, just take every day one at a time. Listen to your doctor and also don't be afraid to do your own research to find out what is going to make this more comfortable for you. There are many options out there and everyone with this disease is different in what helps them through it. I am still getting by somehow despite what I am going through, and I feel like you're in a similar situation. But you can get through this. There is hope despite what we may be going through. Just don't be afraid to lean on others for support, take all accommodations offered to you to make life easier, and also do your own research to find out what will work best for you. Best of luck.
