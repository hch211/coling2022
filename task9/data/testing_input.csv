9001,"So first off, I *have* made an appointment with an ophthalmologist. But it's a month out still and I've been a little stressed so wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts. About four years ago, I noticed that I was having some binocular diplopia. This was most noticeable when driving, where I was struggling to bring the two images together. For what it's worth, it also seemed to be a little worse in bright light or in the morning. I went to the optometrist, and they gave me prism lenses and sent me on my way. However, I just recently went to a new optometrist and they said, ""Oh wait! That's unusual in adults and could be very serious! Please go see an ophthalmologist. Which I'm now doing. I know the list of possible explanations isn't pretty. It could be multiple sclerosis or myasthenia gravis or a brain tumor. It could be thyroid eye disease (I do have Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis). I'm stressed out about these things, but the prospect I'm most stressed about is that it's an unruptured aneurysm, and I'm at risk of just dropping dead at any moment. I wish my appointment wasn't so far away still! I don't seem to have any other symptoms associated with *any* of these things. No headaches, no weird muscle stuff, etc. I will say that I had used some stimulants in advance of the initial onset""<U+00A6>. nothing crazy like a big coke bender. And nothing that I continued doing. Is it likely that four years of double vision and no other symptoms can be explained by a brain aneurysm? Thanks for any thoughts. EDIT: 38 year old male. 5'8, 155 lbs. "
9002,"Per the clinic ophthalmologist I have monocular diplopia, bilaterally. First thing in the morning, no diplopia. It progressively gets worse through the day, especially if I read or work at the computer. By the end of the day, it's severe enough that I have trouble reading or watching TV. Dry eye syndrome was the pronouncement. I'm 69 btw. I've been using warm compresses at least once a day. Using single use drops, about 2-4 times a day. Trying to take breaks with distance focusing & blinking. No improvement noted. The only improvement is when I wear my contacts but by the end of the day, I still have significant ghosting especially in my left eye even with the contact in place. I'm using multi-focal contacts. Vision is very good with them, until the ghosting develops. The contacts I'm using are B&L Ultra. The left contact is minimal correction so the lens itself is very thin. I'm surmising that's why ghosting develops more in my left eye as the day goes on. Enough background, here's my question. I'd like to see an ophthalmologist, not in a clinic (because it's not guaranteed that I see the same Dr each time), who specializes in dry eye syndrome, but not sure how to find one. The couple of offices I've contacted locally respond, ""sure, we can treat dry eye syndrome"", but I get the impression this is a canned answer. So, what specific questions can I pose to them to confirm that they actually specialize, or at least will do more than just generically recommend drops/compresses/etc? "

9004,"Hi, everyone :-)I have had Keratoconus in 15 years now. I use Scleral lenses. I have always bought sunglasses around 5-15$. Last month i went to my optican. When i first was there i asked her about some recomendation for sunglasses. She really recomended me to buy something with more quality, and better lenses. She pointed out av brand named Maui Jim. I have the last week done some research on the sunglasses, and they seems to be a very good brand. My reason for posting her is I really need to know if putting 250-300$ are worth it (with Keratoconus).As mentioned. I have always bought sunglasses around 5-15$, but I feel they are a little hard(?) to look thorugh sometimes... Im no longer a student, and can for the first time in my life invest in sunglasses. Is Maui Jim worth it? Would love to hear others with keratoconus and your experience with sunglasses :-). "
9005,IVMED-80. Not a lot of literature on it and it is very new. Worth following but not enough known for now. 
9006,"Hey guys! I have an open box of progent, 6 treatments (I used one, then realized it should not be used on my brand of lenses, oops!). The expiration date is 01-31-2022. You can have the remaining vials for free if you pay shipping. "
9007,Hey so yesterday and the day before I saw horizontal dark lines kinda like a shadow across my vision. It happened in the evening both times around kinda the same time. They lasted for like 20 seconds both times. Should I be concerned? 
9008,"29F My eyes get fatigued and veiny fast. I suffer from light sensitivity. Whenever I use my phone, laptop or watch tv for more than an hour, my eyes get extremely tired and my head heavy. My jaws and hands become slightly stiff. My neck gets stiff and slightly painful too. I try to stay away from lights, even indoors as much as possible. I seem to always want to close my eyes when possible, I feel better when I do. Yesterday, I didn't use any gadgets for the whole day. I went on with my usual routine, I did chores, ate and worked out. I felt normal. My whole body felt normal. Today, I used my phone as I normally did, hours of surfing the internet and reading stuffs and now my eyes feel tired and my body feels stiff, especially my jaws and fingers. I've already tried moisturizing eye drops but they don't help. Before, I could spend more than 10hours on my phone uninterrupted. I first experienced numbness and tingling on my body a month ago. I thought stroke or some neurological problems. I've figured out, it's all because of my eyes. I feel normal when I don't use gadgets or watch tvs. Why is this? My vision is same as it used to be. No floaters, double vision or partial blindness. "
9009,"Well said. I had a vitrectomy to take a dislodged IOL out and put another one in the capsule. This was in 1999, 17 years after my graft in that eye. Today, I am seeing 20/40 in that eye with glasses. "
9010,What is half this stuff and should I be using it?! I've been in sclerals for 10 years and all I use is Boston Simplus with the occasional protein remover. Sometimes I switch to the hydrogen peroxide but that's it. Should I be doing more? 
9011,"Its normal big changes while you are teen. At 20s it should stop growing cause you stop growing. Two of the bigger factors for miopia or hipermetropia is the relation between the curve of the cornea and the length of the eye. Its important also to have good visul habits and try to stay outside at solar light can limit the ""grow"" of your miopia. I hope it helps and sorry for my shity english. "
9012,h damn ..... njoy it while you can. 've likely had it since around that same age. y right eye got worse suddenly. ut I didn't get diagnosed with until last year. ust now getting my contacts at 37. 
9013,"Hey there, I've asked my optometrist, and his best guess was it's more to do with my brain chemistry and how it affects my perception. Basically at times my vision will kick into a UHD 120 FPS kind of style. Everything becomes extra crisp, movements are faster, colors are brighter. It's not like my normal vision is comparable to 30 FPS, I still think my normal vision is pretty good. This has also happened my whole life, glasses or not. Any guesses would be welcomed, it doesn't bother me, and I haven't noticed anything that really kicks it in. Thanks! "

9015,"I'm seeing flashes in my vision under very specific circumstances. I am 17/M and pretty near sighted. I've been staring at screens for 10+ hours a day recently due to school for maybe the past week or 2. I don't get these flashes during the day, only in the dark after I've been laying down for a bit. After Maybe 10-15 minutes after laying in bed, I see maybe 4-5 rapid flashes of white light on the edges of my vision once I open my eyes. Again, this doesn't happen during the day, only at night when my glasses are off. I only see them with my night light on, and don't see them in complete darkness. I've took some time off and mostly slept/ rested my eyes for the pas 2 days, and the flashing seems to have gotten better(gone in left eye, faint in right eye) is this just a result of excessive eye strain or something else? Also FYI my right eye is my good eye if that helps. "

9018,"I was diagnosed with PVD in my left eye back in 2018 when I had a sudden increase in floaters. I'm seeing the same photopsia consistently every time it occurs randomly. What I see is a small, white circle that moves **very fast** in a counterclockwise direction and lasts about a **second**. It's only in my left eye. This is definitely not a floater. This always happens in the morning when I wake up. It's more noticeable when I have my eyes closed. I've started to see it maybe once during the day time now. Since the start of the year, I've seen my retina specialist twice and my ophthalmologist once. My eyes are otherwise healthy. My left eye also has a retina scar that I've known about since my 20s (55M). The drawing I made is not on the scale as what I see is much smaller but it's a general idea. How common is this a repetitive photopsia with PVD? https://preview.redd.it/4ssq524ya5c51. jpg? width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf40b006dc677786899084f34f822e6df761e190. "
9019,"Always have a pair of glasses with a current prescription and Wear Them frequently! Don't wear you contacts everyday (even if you hate wearing glasses)! If you do have your contacts in all day and most days, it wont hurt to give your eyes a break for a few days without them quite frequently by wearing your glasses. If you don't like wearing glasses in public, do it anyways as it wont hurt to wear them often! I know too many people that wear contacts and totally abandoned their glasses once they started wearing contacts and have trouble, Contacts do have advantages and be sure not to over wear them and replace when needed. I have worn contacts for almost 33 years but I don't wear them much anymore for many reasons. It is so much easier for me to put on my glasses and my eyes feel better after a long day. Plus it can be expensive to deal with contacts since you need to have a good pair or two of glasses. "
9020,"Ophthalmologist here. Scleritis is usually a bilateral condition, although it often presents unilaterally initially. However, after 15 years, yours is likely to remain unilateral. Absent specific and obvious unilateral causes (eg, infectious scleritis; hx of radiation exposure), we don't know why some cases are unilateral. I am unaware of a well-established relationship between menstrual hormones and scleritis. "

That second one had an extra hour of lecture per week to help catch people up. You do need to use basic calculus for the physics problems, plus an intro calculus course is usually a prerequisite for optometry, so it is useful to have knowledge of that from highschool so you have better grades in university.

9027," everything is fine, come again next year That is correct. The only way to accurately diagnose glaucoma is to observe further deterioration. Glaucoma is defined as a change in the optic disc. By it's very definition, you have to see change. Otherwise it could be an entire host of causes other than glaucoma. Your corneal thickness is actually somewhat high, not average. Also, according to OHTS, only ocular hypertension over 25 IN ADDITION TO a CCT under 555 put you at greater risk of glaucoma. Even your highest IOP isn't in that category, and your CCT definitely isn't. And even then, only 1/3 of the patients in the highest risk category patients got glaucoma; 2/3 did not. Having mild OHT alone is almost meaningless: https://www.reviewofoptometry.com/article/a-new-risk-factor-corneal-thickness. "
9028,"I was diagnosed with soeren's about 3 years ago and am miserable constantly, I am chronically in pain, exhausted, battling migraines and can't even eat or drink anything without choking. I see on here that other rheumatologists are actually doing something except telling me to use eye drops, lozenges and just having to live with it. But over the counter eye drops burn my eyes even the preservative free ones and the lozenges don't do anything to stop me choking while anything that stimulates saliva production causes unbearable pain in my glands. I did some research on my own and believe I am experiencing cns involvement but when I brought it up I was dismissed and dry eyes/mouth is the only symptom, it isn't causing my pain other than the glands. I don't see how people are actually getting things done. Years before I was able to be diagnosed I had a positive ana, my pcp thought I had lupus and sent me to a rheumatologist, he didn't do a physical exam or order any tests, told me if I had any autoimmune disorder it would have been diagnosed or found when I was a kid then offered to refer me to a psychologist for pain. A few years pass and I move states, new pcp refers me to one thinking I have lupus and he tells me I probably just have fibromyalgia and that I was most likely an enigma, someone with a positive Ana and no reason why. This time I advocated for myself and he said he could run some tests but they would probably all show up negative. I showed positive for ss-a/ss-b and a few other things. A situation happened where I ended up having to report him and got sent to the only rheumatologist my insurance will cover and he seems to have the same mindset. I get that I am 21 and shouldn't be debilitated but I am. It feels like they think I'm looking for drugs but I just want this to stop, I don't want to be afraid to eat or drink because of pain and choking, I can't even think of a day in my life I haven't been in pain. I can tell my boyfriend is bothered by my constantly being out of commission because we can't really go anywhere with out me getting sick. I just need to know if this will stop, if things will get better because I can't keep living like this. Please tell me how you actually got help. "
9029,"I took my sister (20F) to the premier eye clinic in our state yesterday for Antimetropia, which she's had since she was 3. Her right eye (she calls it her dominant eye) is 20/20 with -3.00 correction, but her left eye is at 20/50 with +1.50. She has an amblyopia in her left eye because of this. She already experiences some double vision with this amount of correction. Her vision has never been great because of this, but it has gotten so bad recently that she's only 20, but currently refuses to drive at night or in the rain because with her depth perception issues she simply cannot tell how far away objects are. She describes it as her left eye ""turning off"" and says she can barely use it to see. The ophthalmologist that we saw yesterday told us the she ""sees 60 year olds who are blind, you should be glad you can see at all"" and that ""at least your eye doesn't wander too much so you're still pretty"". She said there were no treatment options and that ""no one gets night vision"". Can anyone tell me if this is true? Are there any treatment or corrective options? Or is my 20 year old sister is resigned to headaches, difficulty seeing, and double vision for the rest of her life? We were at the best eye clinic in the area, so we don't know where to go from here, but we are having a hard time accepting that all we can do is ""be grateful \[she's\] not totally blind"". "
9030,"u/jeevs92: interesting you ask this. I just posted [a very thorough blog post about tendinitis](https://www.lupusencyclopedia.com/blog/lupus-tendinitis-lupus-tendonitis) in lupus (very closely related to Sjogren's): [https://www.lupusencyclopedia.com/blog/lupus-tendinitis-lupus-tendonitis](https://www.lupusencyclopedia.com/blog/lupus-tendinitis-lupus-tendonitis) The second edition of ""The Sjogren's Book"" (Wallace is editor) comes out later this year or next year and I wrote the tendinitis section of the arthritis chapter. I can't quote it directly, but the bottom line is that studies show that any where from 2% to 21% of Sjogren's patients have tendinitis or tenosynovitis. Studies using ultrasound (as I discuss in my blog) show the highest rates (not surprising, since it is a better test). btw... consider attending our once a year Patient National Conference this Friday and Saturday.

9031,"I worry because I had an IOP of 40 at diagnosis without any pain or blurriness. I never felt my eyeballs at that point, so I have no idea what they felt like. I do know that what I feel during the night is a lot harder than what they feel like during the day. I've seriously considered the iCare, but given my anxiety about my glaucoma diagnosis, I know it would consume my life, so I've decided to hold off for now :). "
9032,"I forgot to mention, in the 15 years since my transplant, great strides have been made in the treatment of keratoconus. You're going to be just fine. "
9033,The optometrist told me I could drive because I can see the legally required line 6/12 on the Snellen scale. I've been to a specialist at the hospital and they haven't been able to tell me why I can't see either. It's a legal requirement to read the number plate. I failed my driving test 3 times because I couldn't read it. . I'm not sure what to do next. My perscription is: Left +3.75 Cyl - 3.50 Right +3.50 Cyl -3.00 I mostly stick to my contacts because my vision is a lot clearer than with my glasses. 
9034,When I wear my glasses for slight astigmatism stop/street signs still have ghosting Of itself all around the sign. Then when I put a pinhole up it's crystal clear. That means cataracts are a possibility? Trying to figure out if it could have been missed at my optometrist appt a couple months ago. Though I don't notice my vision in general being super blurry and am still seeing 20/20 they said. 
9035,"I've just moved to glasses from contact lenses, I've got a strong prescription (about +13) with high index lenses. I noticed today that these glasses split purple LEDs into red and blue components so I can no longer see purple lights on the machines I use at work. Not necessarily a problem, just very curious, I was a bit mind blown when I first saw it today. To clarify, some of the machines I use at work have a series of LED lights. They flash red, blue, yellow, green, and purple for different things. All the colours look normal except the purple one which I see as two separate red and blue lights sitting next to each other. They look about half a centimetre apart and are very distinct, no purple to be seen at all, just red and blue. Can someone explain the physics/optics of this to me? I think it's really interesting.

9036,"So I'm 16 and I've been having terrible double vision and a harder time seeing detail along with really bad starbursting of lights halos and it looks like I got a bunch of dots and things going around my vision if I look at something like a white wall or the side walk. I get terrible after images just from looking at every day objects. My blurry ness and double vision gets worse the farther away I am from the source, things that light up are the worse. I've gone to opthomologists and they all say my eyes look great. One said I might have strabismus which doesn't really make sense to me cause then wouldn't it go away when I covered an eye? I can only get 20 25 vision now compared to my 20 20 vision a year ago. It also happened suddenly when I woke up one day I'm at a loss at what it is. They did a visual field test and the one test where you sit on a machine and look at a picture in it. They also did a sit lamp exam. What should I do now? "
9037,"I'm so sorry you have to suffer from this horrible illness. Just know that you are not alone in this pain. Many of us other soeren's sufferers (or other chronic illness sufferers) are going through and have gone through similar struggles. Obviously that knowledge won't erase your pain, but atleast for me it helps to know I'm not the only one suffering. Your story sounds very similar to mine. I'm 28 and have been sick since I was 19. I don't have a job and I don't see myself ever being able to work full time and that gives me such an intense amount of stress I try not to think about it.

9039,"Your best bet is to visit a refractive surgery center for a consultation. At that visit, your eyes will be checked for refractive surgery eligibility and available options will be discussed with you. If your cornea has any irregular curvature or is too thin, you may not be eligible for LASIK or SMILE. If your level of myopia is too low, you may not be eligible for SMILE or lens implant [Visian ICL](https://us.discovericl.com/). If the space (anterior chamber) inside your eye is too small, your eye will not fit an ICL implant. Without going into details, I have mild myopia. Details are extremely important when considering refractive surgery. These details include your exact prescription(s) over time, your age, your visual needs and your lifestyle. Your physical location is important, as not all surgical options are available in all countries. For example, the newest version of Visian ICL implant with a central hole and TransPRK (all laser touchless PRK) is not available in the US yet. You mention that you have ""mild myopia""<U+009D>. Do you wear your glasses or contact lenses 100% of the time? Do you sometimes prefer to just take your glasses/contacts off when doing extended near work such as reading or computer use? Do you participate in any high impact activities such as martial arts? If you are over age 45, do you wear reading glasses? Let me try to answer some of the questions you've asked: . Out of Intraocular lenses or Laser Eye Surgery which would you recommend? (The posts i've read about IOLs were quite dated, has the technology changed much since 2011-2015?) Intraocular lens technology has dramatically changed over the last few years with increased options for visual correction, as well as multi focal designs. For your situation, I think you are referring to ICL (Implantable Collamer Lens) surgery, and not IOL surgery on younger eyes, also known as Refractive Lens Exchange. It is my understanding that IOLs can be removed if necessary, however this procedure comes with inherent risks. Yes, ICL implant is the most risky of all refractive surgery options. Some of these risks include severe eye infection (endophthalmitis), glaucoma, corneal endothelial cell damage, and premature cataracts. (I think this is a highly subjective question.) Hypothetically, if my eyesight gets worse after I had IOLs implanted, should I risk having them removed, or are the chances of complication too high? And if the odds are not in my favor, what other options do I have to regain my clear vision? If your vision degrades or worsens after ICL implant, cornea laser surgery such as LASIK or PRK can be performed to correct the difference. ICL lens removal does carry additional risks - it may be safer to wait to remove the ICL during cataract surgery. Once removed (assuming, without any complications), can I still have Laser eye surgery, or a new set of IOLs implanted? Does anyone know of people who had their IOLs removed, with or without complications? What were their experiences? Yes you could have laser eye surgery if the ICL is ~~improved~~ removed, or maybe even an ICL lens exchange. Refractive surgery is usually performed once an eye prescription is stable over 1-2 years, so the goal is to avoid more surgery. I only know one person who has needed their ICL removed. He had ICL surgery in his mid 30s, then developed premature cataracts in both eyes 1 year after surgery. Then developed glaucoma. Needed both ICL lens implants removed, followed by cataract surgery. He is on permanent therapy to control his eye pressure. This is a rare occurrence. Out of all the Laser Eye Surgery methods(eg.: SMILE, PRK, LASIK...), is there one you would clearly recommend, or say is a cut above the rest. I have no doubt that all of these technologies are excellent, otherwise they wouldn't be so widespread. I'm kind of asking for personal opinions here. There are so many factors involved that it's hard to say what is the best - it really depends on the individual involved. LASIK is tried and true, has the highest level of precision with the fastest recovery. But LASIK does permanently weaken the strength of the cornea, which can result in complications down the line - there is a rare complication called corneal ectasia which can result in terrible worsening vision. LASIK is not appropriate for someone who does high impact activities such as martial arts. LASIK also severs corneal nerves, and has the highest risk of chronic dry eyes. PRK has been out for over 30 years and also can offer a high level of precision. Problem with PRK is that final visual outcome may not be reached until 4 weeks to 6 months, and recovery can be very painful for the first 4-7 days after surgery. SMILE is the newest form of laser corneal surgery, and has been out for about 10 years. It has a faster recovery than PRK, but slower than LASIK. SMILE severs less corneal nerves and may result in less incidence of dry eye after surgery. Problem with SMILE is that there it does not have eye tracking during surgery and also cannot correct with as much precision (topography guided laser treatment) as compared to LASIK/PRK. I have the same question for IOLs, is there a company/brand or type of lens that offers more in some way? If you are looking for a lens implant, Visian ICL is the way to go. This being said, if your myopia is less than -3.00 you will not qualify for ICL surgery. I hope you found this information helpful. The best thing really is just to go get 2 or 3 different consultations with refractive surgery centers to discuss your options, risks, costs, etc. Your best source for recommended surgery centers will be your optometrist. They make plenty of referrals, and also do co-management of pre and post op care. They see the results first hand. The last thing I want to mention is that there is no surgery that is 100% effective with zero risk. Someone can go to the best surgeon in the world, with the best equipment and technology, and still end up with a (sometimes permanent) complication. While bad outcomes are rare, they can occur. Thankfully the screening technology is much better now and patients usually are disqualified from surgery before proceeding with something that could increase risk of complications. I wish you well on your journey. "
9040,"It's so crazy, isn't it? It makes me wonder if you can make it go away overtime with some kind of system rewire. Like being totally stress free, etc. but I'm sure that's wishful thinking.

Left eye has been stable for months (knock on wood) but right eye is going downhill even with repeated injections. If I can be of any help to anyone, please feel free to ask any questions. "
9042,Far from a genius! But have been wearing these types of lenses for more than 10 years so after a while you start to figure out what works. 
9043,"I get the scan every 6 months to monitor progression of keratoconus. It seems from their website that the pentacam can measure a bunch of other things, and some are behind the cornea, and might be impacted by drops. If you are diabetic they may be checking for glaucoma. Medical appliance manufacturers are often overly pedantic because they don't want to be sued if their machine is used incorrectly and causes an issue. My doctor has been using this machine for 10 years now so I trust they know what they are doing. If you're concerned let them know when you get the test done next time.

9045,"I don't want to rain on this parade, but I'll tell you what I would tell a patient in person: This is exciting news. It is indeed possible to correct for the abberrations created by keratoconus with sophisticated lenses in a pair of glasses. The problem comes from trying to apply the research to get a product to market. In order to measure a patient for the type of lenses in this article, a wavefront abberrometer would be needed at the office fitting the lenses. Depending on how the research goes, this might be a proprietary machine costing $80,000. The local eye doctor would then have to calculate how many pairs of these glasses would have to be sold before the technology becomes obsolete. So, if you have keratoconus, this is an exciting article because the research could yield some great breakthroughs that allow your doctor to fit you into a better pair of glasses. It is not currently reasonable to expect such glasses to surpass or even equal the vision from a pair of well fit RGPs. I guess I'm saying be excited because the more knowledge we have, the better everything gets. But don't expect a pair of these glasses to deliver perfect vision, or be available at a cost comparable to current glasses options. Source: I'm an optometrist. I'd gladly continue discussion. "
9046,"My left is is good, 20/20, but my right eye is a blurry glaring mess and has been for years, I had the surgery maybe 9-10 years ago. I am now really wishing to spend money on getting it sorted so I can maybe put my HGV Class 1 license to good use. After the initial surgery, my right eye healed with haze. A second op was done and the haze lasered away, but again it came back, and with a vengeance. So this isn't the fault of bad surgery, just how my eye healed itself. As such, glasses can't help as the prescription may not be bad but it's looking through the layer of haze, or so that's how I understand it anyway. A few years ago I saw a specialist in London, linked to the company involved. He basically said nothing can be done save for a cornea transplant I believe. Apparently my is also very dry or something. When a drop was put on it, the drop either broke up or didn't, whichever is the worse one. I don't really suspect any bias on his finding, but as their company would of paid (or part paid) for any further treatment, I can't 100% be sure. I don't know what to do now. I suppose I can't just see my GP and go from there? I assume I have to pay for a private specialist? How do I decide how or who to see etc? Also, if a cornea transplant does turn out to be the only solution, is that even a viable option? Are they only given to people who no doubt deserve it more than me? If possible are the risks even worth it too, as I have vision at least, albeit it very blurry. Thank you for any advice (41M, UK). "

That said, for healthier habits be sure to spend more time outdoors being active as well as limiting your screen time and taking breaks from near tasks. "

9050,"So, I was diagnosed at 5 years old ( now 20) with a positive SSA and ANA too. My SSA was 947 when 0-99 was normal, so they immediately started me on plaquenil. My understanding is that it is meant to help suppress the diseases progression overall. However, I do believe you are correct that you will mostly feel the benefits in a reduction in fatigue and joint pain. Some of the things that have helped me with dry eyes in restasis eye drops. For dry mouth I like using biotin mouth wash and mouth spray. I would recommend getting a good opthalmologist and visiting your dentist. Sjogren's can cause eye damage and cavities if you don't keep up with those doctors. Good luck, I hope you continue to not have much fatigue and join pain and that your disease doesn't progress further. Edit: Congrats on the baby! "

I haven't been having no discharge at all since September tmi. This past month I started having new symptoms like dry eyes, and joint pain. Sorry if I'm rambling.

9052,"TLDR: Is it dangerous to have 250 (left) and 550 (right) eye grades? My astigmatism for the left is 125 and 50 for the right. Hello, I decided to ask this question here so that I'll have a definite clarification. I've recently bought a new pair of glasses after 2 years, and my right eye power have increased so much compared to my left. I'm 18 years old, and my old glasses had 275 for the left and 350 for the right. The doctor in charged for the check up also said that I have astigmatism: 125 for the left and 50 (?) for the right. I'm really confused as to how I have a huge gap between my two eyes, and my family does not want me to go to an ophthalmologist because it costs too much (and my father likes to blame me for this). I also forgot to ask the doctor there about this. So I want to ask here as to how this happened (the 250-550 gap)? And is this instance dangerous, like could I impair my vision in the future? I'm really scared after I knew about having a 550 eye power for my right eye :((. "
9053,"I recently injured my left eye which later developed high intraocular pressure. I do not have glaucoma -yet. But I am taking glaucoma eye drops (Combigan 2x a day) in just my left eye (my other eye is uninjured and healthy). Wow do the drops dry my eye out (combined with work related screen time) and I then have weird sensation/tingling sensation changes go down into my left cheek, left gums, and to the top of my left eye when it's really dry. My glaucoma specialists said this isn't due to any pressure on the optic nerve (my IOP is routinely under 20 in the injured eye) as I had the symptoms during an exam and they checked my IOP. Unfortunately my specialist doesn't have much advice about treating dry eye. Anyone experience this? Any insights to share about finding relief? I just ordered Refresh Optiva Mega-3 drops and Refresh P.M. eye ointment to give these preservative free options a try. So far, the dry eye symptoms are far worse than any elevated IOP symptoms that I had. This is all new to me so I appreciate any advice or insights anyone can share. "
9054,"The doc told me that because KC is potentially hereditary, meaning my children (when/if I'll have some) are more likely to be affected by KC than the average person. I need to have my children's cornea regularly scanned (corneal topography) and in case my children are diagnosed with KC (hopefully that won't be the case) CXL needs to be performed as soon as possible to **PREVENT** the disease from progressing and permanently affecting the vision of my children. Depending on how ""aggressive"" the disease is, my children might have to undergo CXL surgery **up to three times** in their lives until their cornea stabilizes with progressing age and natural UV light. I'm 27 years old and just got CXL performed on my right eye (left soon to follow). The doctor **advised to regularly scan my cornea** and said that in case a progression of the disease is noticeable I should undergo CXL again. However, the doctor thinks that that is an unlikely scenario because I'm close to the age in which the cornea naturally stiffens up. If I had corneal topography done in my late teens or early twenties (had 20/20 back then), KC would have been diagnosed at a much earlier stage and CXL would have prevented the deterioration of my vision. So, to finally address your questions: ""Should I be worried about my Keratoconus progressing even though I underwent a successful procedure ??"" ""<U+0080><U+009C> Yes, do regularly get your eyes checked and your cornea scanned. Keep an eye on your KC, my friend ;) However, don't be scared everything is gonna be alright. Seems like you're in good hands. ""Is it common for Keratoconus patients to undergo more than one procedure ??"" ""<U+0080><U+009C> I'm not aware of any statistics, so I can not say whether that is common or not, but my doctor says in some cases he has performed CXL more than once on the same patient. So I would recommend to be mentally prepared for that situation, however likely or unlikely it is. Good luck to you, but honestly I think you're going to be fine! "

I'm 37 now and I still have all these symptoms. It's super difficult to explain them accurately. I can see small text near and far, but it's like my eyes don't play as a team anymore and my brain has problem with the image they provide. It was very scary at the time and caused anxiety and depression. My family members noticed that I had developed slightly lazy eye and the eyelid of the same eye is drooping a bit. I'm 37 now. I still have all those symptoms but I'm so used to them I tend to forget their existence. When I read text, it's difficult to keep focus as my eyes feel like bouncing all over the place. I don't have double vision.. If I close my other eye and force one eye to focus on one point, my vision gets shaky and my eye gets tired and feels strained. The feeling is like, when my both eyes are open, they work in a certain way to give my brain as good of an overall vision as they can, but when one eye is closed, the open eye has to get used to a way different way of working.

9060,"Hello all, I hope I'm not infringing on your space by posting; I'm not diagnosed with Sjogren's but have had growing suspicions for the last year or so. (Even my mom, an RN who is usually very anti-googling symptoms, told me to google it when she heard about it because my symptoms are similar). I'm a twenty-year-old girl. I'm currently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, GERD, IBS, anemia, chronic pelvic pain and TMD (ER doctors tend to look at me like I'm crazy when I offer that list). I'm also currently in the process of being assessed for Endometriosis and POTS. Just sharing this to maybe contextualize some symptoms. (Skip the next three paragraphs if you want to spare yourself an in-depth analysis of my symptoms.) My symptoms started in 2015-ish when I developed a dry cough, trouble swallowing, and choking on my food. My doctor at the time did an ultrasound to check my thyroid and lymphnodes and, when that came back fine, decided it was probably just anxiety. I saw an ENT last year who thought it was caused by my GERD, but a few months after that I started using Biotene (after noticing more obvious dry mouth symptoms) and that's the only thing that's ever had any impact on my symptoms. I also had a random increase in the number of cavities I got, which is still on-going, I also can't drink water without burning/irritation and haven't been able to for a couple years? Idk if that's a thing? But I can for a bit after using Biotene. My eye symptoms are a bit more obvious. I have the general gritty, foreign object feeling and obvious dryness. My optometrist did the dye test and said it showed that they were dry. It's usually already bad in the morning, I wake up with really swollen and red eye lids and severe eye pain, but gets worse throughout the day. My tears, when I do produce them (usually from yawning or the ""oh shit I forgot my eye drops"" overcompensation), are incredibly painful. It feels almost like acid in my eyes, and I can't open them properly for a while afterwards. I also dk if that's a thing though. I also have dry skin and vaginal dryness, but the other non-dry mouth or eye symptoms are harder to assess. I have chronic fatigue and muscle pain, but I also have Fibromyalgia, so I don't know? Over the past few months I've developed joint symptoms, particularly in my hands, that I've never had from my Fibromylagia before. They get super painful, stiff, and a bit swollen and my knuckles turn purple-ish red. Anyway, sorry for the info dump. I have an appointment with my doctor on March 11th and want to bring up the possibility that something systemic like Sjogren's might be going on, but I'm scared she'll just dismiss it, given my pre-existing diagnoses. I'm also on a tricyclic antidepressant which I know can cause dry eyes and mouth, but I started that medication in December of 2017, years after the dryness symptoms started. These symptoms have had a serious impact on my life, controlling what I can eat and drink and how I spend my days. I'm an English major and recently the dry eyes have gotten so bad, despite drops 4x a day and hot compresses daily, that I can hardly read books for class. So, uh, any advice on how to bring this up to my doctor in a way that is not likely to land me with another referral to a psychiatrist? (Just to clarify, current doctor is actually really nice and has referred me to many specialists this year. I just have some trauma from previous doctors that makes me really anxious.). "
9061,Can I ask why you choose to wear glasses? My eyes are -0.25 and -2.25 but when I was young the optometrist basically said I can choose to wear or not wear glasses since my dominant eye compensates for my myopic one and I can see fine without glasses (nothing is fuzzy) So I haven't worn glasses basically since I was born but recently I have been thinking about prescribing some to wear for eye strain reasons. 
9062,"Did you get an itemized receipt with the breakdown of the products? If your insurance was anything less than VSP, $800 doesn't sound unreasonable. The reasons for that is hi index lenses have additional copay if not covered at all. 1.74 even less so. With your astigmatism, they have to add antireflective coating, and they probably used the better stuff. I wouldn't suggest the cheaper stuff. Finally the frames. Insurance only covers so much. I would not suggest online options. A prescription as high as yours will require PD as well as OC, and OC has to be measured in person. "
9063,"I've freaked myself out by googling, which i'm aware is never a good idea.

I'm now 28 years old and was referred to a Specialist Registrar to have the pigment looked at again. Before he looked at my eyes, he asked me if we had any history of colon issues in the family but due to my Mum not being raised by her biological family I don't know. He then examined my dilated eyes and confirmed bilateral peripheral pigmented lesions with no evidence of any concerning features. He reassured me with regards to the lesions, giving their longstanding nature and appearances but said it is possible they represent CHRPE. He said to he will monitor the lesions for the time being but he is not concerned. My Mother also was born with pigment and has had it investigated a number of times and they always say its also fine. However, google says multiple bilateral lesions are almost always linked to FAP and now i'm sick with worry but the specialist never mentioned that so can you have bilaterial pigment and it be of no concern?

9064,"Hey OP, I came on this thread to find out something similar. I've only had this happen to me three times (twice last year in the span of a month and once two weeks ago). I tracked my symptoms and they sound are similar to yours. Each time, I'll get a small dot in what appears to be my left eye, usually at the peripheral but the most recent time it was in the center. Weirdly, when I close my eyes, I can see the edges of the darkness and it looks like small flickering white/black bulbs in a line. It grows over time (probably an episode of 20 minutes or so) to the point that I can't see past it / can be up to 30% - 40% of my vision, and then disappears. The most recent time this occurred for three times over the course of three hours. Each time I always get a very slight slight ache behind my right eye. I've always thought this happened after straining at a screen, such that I'm having a retinal headache. I do a lot of work in front of a screen (I actually use a small TV as a monitor as I had heard this could help eye strain when reading since it's a much bigger screen than my actual computer? I'm wondering if it's worsening my eyes as I'm unaware the differences between a computer monitor and a TV monitor, but I digress). I haven't seen anyone about it yet but curious if this sounds like what you have. Hope we both figure it out! Let me know if I should explain something in more detail haha. "

Any doctor I've seen does not even bother to investigate, other than sending me for a routine blood test that always comes back 'normal'. I really am losing hope, and have resorted to therapy as I have become depressed from my health conditions. For context: - 23F, 5ft3, about 9st, Irish Caucasian, no alcohol, no smoking, no drugs. Main Complaint: - very dry eyes for the past 2 and a half years. Highly frustrating as I had to give up my job due to blurry vision. Have to wear sunglasses if it is very bright, even indoors. Been to many opticians that's say my eyes are very dry and prescribed eye drops and ointment which I use everyday. Meibomian glands are not blocked and seem normal, but tears still evaporate at an alarming rate. NHS ophthalmologist completely disregarded my complaints and said it was all in my head. I also drink at least 2 litres of water a day, which I have done since I was little. This seems to have appeared out of nowhere which is why I find it so difficult to understand and cope with. I can't understand how I have evaporative dry eyes if my meibomian glands are fine?? Including additional information on other health issues for context: -8mm pineal cyst only discovered a month ago. - Severe palmar and plantar primary hyperhidrosis since birth. No cure, but I manage sometimes with iontophoresis machine. - Symptoms of PCOS or endometriosis (course hairs around chin and lip, bloating, heavy and highly irregular periods, fatigue, acne on chin and jawline) Ultrasound results shows 'bulky' ovaries but not enough to warrant a diagnosis. And blood tests came back 'normal'. - episodes of insomnia for the past 3 years, very random and haven't been able to get a good sleep routine since. - extreme fatigue All The Time, no matter if I had a full night's sleep and eat healthy. -really random indents/lines/marks that appear in my hands and arms that last for about 5 mins and disappear again. First appeared in 2017. I've noticed that they usually appear if I've had a bad night's sleep. (Pictures in link) https://imgur.com/a/qRQRvA9 - Very slight scoliosis, a chiropractor has helped a lot and my upper back pain has virtually disappeared. - prone to cold sores on mouth and nose if I am feeling rundown or stressed (parents are the same.) - dry skin and occasional psoriasis, switching shower gel has helped. - eczema as a kid for many years.

9068,Thanks for the comment. I have heard that myopia usually stops progressing at 20. I'm already 3 years past that point. You still think there's a possibility that my Rx could stabilise ? Please don't mind my skepticism It's just that I don't see any signs of it slowing down.

It's not getting any better, but I want to address it before I have to lay my book on the floor to read. No contacts or glasses before. After talking with the doctor, I decided on getting a contact for only one eye, as he said if I got them for both, it would inhibit my distance vision. He also wrote me a script for glasses, as I may get those as well. My glasses script is: L * Sphere 0.00 * Cyl -0.50 * Axis 180 * Add 1.25 R * Sphere 0.25 * Cyl -1.00 * Axis 015 * Add 1.25 My contacts script is: R only * Sphere 1.25 * Cyl -0.75 * Axis 010 * Add ---- * Base Curve 8.4 * Diameter 14.5 * Style Biotrue Oneday Toric 90pk My bill reflects a ""new toric fit"" charge of $144.00. I was surprised at the charge, but am unfamiliar with what is needed. However, after doing some research, it seems that ""toric"" is for astigmatism. I don't ever remember him mentioning astigmatism.

9075,"For years my mother has taken care of me. Obviously for most of my life she did, but she also had to take some extra care while I was not well, and when I had covid she took care of me while potentially putting herself in harm's way. We didn't know then she had gotten covid and it's likely why I got it. She barely had symptoms while I almost died because I had it severely, and not knowing she already had it, was putting her life potentially at risk to care for me. I might not be here if she didn't. She didn't take care of me super well during Soeren's. She did her best, but there were times she made things harder than they needed to be. She was not financially prepared to have an adult daughter suddenly become disabled from illness that took five years to diagnose. We're finally in a somewhat stable position, but I've been VERY sedentary since the beginnings of my Soeren's journey. I didn't realize how much until this past week when she's the one who needs care. She had to get surgery on her hand. Minor but it's her strong hand so she hasn't been able to do much for herself. And then she got dental work done yesterday. Also, one of her very good friends that she's known since childhood hood passed away. I've been taking on a lot of emotional and physical work that I wasn't normally doing, and I feel mentally spent. I feel horrible about it. I'm thirty two, still living with her because of Soeren's crap and then the pandemic, but I was finally starting to get my life together. Now I have this sick feeling inside of me that I will have to take care of her forever and I will never get to live. Soeren's took five years of my life from not being diagnosed for so long. It seems completely ridiculous given that she's going to be better in a few weeks and things will go back to normal, but it scares me how much I don't want to be doing anything. I don't know if I'm still stuck in this mode of not wanting to leave my bed. I've been grappling with the fact that I maybe do still want children and definitely do want a partner, which feels extremely far from where I'm at now, but I am tired just washing dishes and cooking and helping out my mom? I have started the process of going to therapy, but it won't start for a few more weeks. I feel really selfish and completely inadequate. ** to add, I think what's really upsetting me here is that maybe I wouldn't be able to take care of a kid and I shouldn't worry about having one.

And for anti ageing of couse most of our skin care is around the eye as the skin there sags with age. It did upset me that retinol was on that list as i know it is a very good anti ageing ingredient. So if you have the same condition as me, what skincare do you use and are you able to manage your dry eye condition? "
9080,"So as a child I was diagnosed with colorblindness (red/green). I want to become a police officer and am going to get my vision tested in a month. I can't pass the Ishihara plate test online, I can only make out a few with 100% accuracy, and get the numbers wrong on the other plates. I can however, pass the D-15 Farnsworth test and according to the online test I'm not colorblind. I'm allowed to take the D-15 if I fail the Ishihara, for my eye exam requirement. I'm curious to know how these are issued in real life. Is there a time limit? Is it done with physical items or on a screen? "
9081,"I was diagnosed about a year and a half ago after the birth of my first kid, at 34 yrs old. I had been dealing with more and more symptoms for years, but dry eyes, brain fog and painful joints were the worst. I had been feeling increasingly depressed in the belief that this was a normal progression of age and I would continue to ""fall apart"" as time passed. At first, my diagnosis was a blow and I was suddenly dealing with the reality that my body was no longer my own... no longer ""me,"" but this ""possession"" I would have to manage. I hated that I would have to give up baking sweet things and couldn't accept all the things I would have to give up. BUT, then I realized that all of those million little annoying problems were really just ONE problem that I had the possibility of correcting. Does it still suck? Sure. But now I have answers. I switched my diet up and dropped everything I was supposed to and I immediately felt better. Now, I know how to deal with a symptom before it gets out of hand and I'm comforted by the ability to control it better. The unsolicited advice: people are going to give you a million diet suggestions. Just do the work, drop all of the possible culprits and you will be surprised at how much better you will feel, physically AND mentally. Then you can add things slowly back in and it will be much easy to tell what you can and can't have. You might be surprised at what you occasionally enjoy. "

9086,A transplant is not inevitable. Only 20% of untreated KC patients need a transplant. That number should go way down for those with CXL although it is still too soon to know what really will happen. The likelihood of getting to the point of needing a transplant also go down as you get older. If you make it into your 40s without a transplant you are probably are out of the woods. Try to get on with your life. There is a very good chance that your cross linking wearing off and a transplant are things that will never happen. Just keep up with your regular eye exams to monitor the state of your KC.

Unfortunately no one told me KC usually stops progressing in your 40s so I had about 20 years of worry until they told me that, along with telling me my deterioration of vision was due to cataracts, not KC. Definitely keep up with at least annual eye exams that include topographies because KC is nothing if not unpredictable. "
9091,"Age: 28 Gender: Male Lens: Acuvue Oasys w/ HydraLuxe Single Use So I started wearing contacts when I was 15 I want to say, maybe somewhat earlier but that doesn't really matter. Wore them for 6 years if not more before switching to glasses full time. Wore glasses thereafter until now (well I still have glasses). For the last 4 years I have always gotten glasses then also gotten contacts, but would try tons of different ones and then can't stand any of them for an entire day due to ""feeling them""<U+009D> and perceived dryness (not sure if it's actually dryness). I had the realization the other day, ""are my eyes dry due to being prescribed Vyvanse?""<U+009D> (Stimulant for ADHD). I really want contacts to work but one full day is painful. Should I look into additional eye drops? Is it a trade off situation that if I want contacts I have to stop Vyvanse because it's drying out my eyes? Do I just need to stop being a baby and power through a couple days and then I'll be fine? I would also like to note that I haven't not taken Vyvanse and tried to wear contacts to rule out the possibility of dry eyes caused by the medication. Outside of all of that, my eyes are extremely healthy, great tear ducts, etc. "
9092,"CXL is very important for a 10yo. I am surprised that the KC is already severe at such a young age. But KC often progresses more rapidly for those where it starts at a young age. I would go with epi-off because you want the most certainty of success. Epi-on is a newer technique and it isn't as standardized or as well proven as epi-off. Epi-on might eventually be proven to be a better technique but it isn't there yet. Your 10yo needs the best likelihood of stopping KC now, which is epi-off. It is going to be a rough week or so and I wish your child all the best for a successful outcome. "
9093,"20 years of wearing Rgp here. Here are the reasons and what you can do. First of all, rgp lens has important parameters and very little adjustment can have huge difference in comfort and eliminating the redness. One of the most important parameter is the edge lift or the landing of the lens, if it is decreased except discomfort and redness. Finding a specialist who can adjust the fit is difficult. I had a success after years of the same issue as yours and though i am not anymore can tolerate rgps after trying with many opticians but i did my research and advised the specialist. One thing you can do as well, use eye drops but you need months to see the difference. "

Long story short I'm getting a scleral lense for my right eye shortly but I've gone about 5 years using only my left eye (with a soft contact lense as it hasn't progressed too bad) which means my brain has forgotten the use of my right eye so I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions as to how to get my brain to use it again? At my scleral fitting my right eye only adjusted if I closed my left eye so essentially if both eyes are open my brain uses only my left eye.

Here's a video about it: https://youtu.be/hp_uNxs-ow4 Also during the day just to keep your eyes moist I regularly use natural tears. In the summer I'll use wipes more often just because of allergies and natural tears to keep my eyes from being dry. Best advice though is see an optometrist who knows about blepharitis and is somewhat current on it. I used to do the baby shampoo stuff, tea tree oil about 12 years ago and it really only provides very short term relief. There's also a treatment that some optometrist are starting to offer called blephex. It's not in my area yet but I hear it works well. "
9104,"I lived in Goldsboro from 1985-1993. Yes, Duke IS the best place to go for KC. I had transplants in Arkansas (where I am from) in 1980 and 1982 and the Duke doctors really knew their stuff. I am now going to The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock and I have the professor of cornea as my doctor. He put me in Sclerals a few months ago and said that he would file them under ""Medical Necessity."" Well, Medicare (I am 67) has covered the fitting but I haven't heard back about the lens coverage. Here, the lenses are MUCH cheaper at 600.00 a pair. Maybe it's because I am older and have very old grafts. Fortunately, I was in glasses after the transplants till a few months ago when I had the need for sclerals. I can share my full KC story if you like. I usually share it with the newly diagnosed.

9106,"Hi- No ophthalmologists near me have appointments left this year, so I made an appointment at an optometrist office for next week. I am wondering if there's anything I should be sure to ask about, or anything I should make sure the office can test for before going in? In the beginning of October I developed some light sensitivity, then the feeling there was something in my eye, then slight sharp pain associated with eye movement. 2 days of really dry eye. Now there is a pressure behind the eye, maybe the sinus area, the eyes feel sore. There is a tiny amount of white discharge in one eye, and some on the eyelashes (I looked up blepharitis, its definitely not so much that it would cause the eye to stick together, just a tiny amount reoccurring throughout the day). I am a carrier for brittle cornea syndrome and have a type of dysautonomia so have been sure to have electrolytes throughout the day to keep hydrated. I discontinued use of an antihistamine in case that was causing problems. I was hoping it was some kind of viral infection that would go away, but its been about 3 weeks. Am using eye drops and heat mask. No major change in color, no change in vision. Have myopia and astigmatism. Don't wear contacts. 32 yr old female. "

I'm -0.50 in the right eye and 0.00 in the left (sphere) and -0.25 right eye and -0.75 left eye (cylinder). Those numbers don't seem too bad, but when I take my glasses off, things 30-50 feet away--people, street signs, license plates--are blurry. Why do I feel like such a drop off in visual acuity when the numbers in my prescription show slight nearsightedness and don't seem too bad. Am I missing something? "
9108,I'm in my mid 30s and have Fuchs. I have seen an opthamologist twice with my optometrist keeping on top of my condition at yearly eye exams. Vision in one of my eyes is now bad enough that I can't read my phone screen on bad days but just a bit blurry on good days. My opthamologist was very much 'come back when it causes problems' as the dystrophy was first detected on a routine eye exam before it caused any symptoms. I had a routine eye exam just a few months ago and the optometrist was unable to correct my vision with corrective lenses and I almost constantly feel like something is stuck in my eye. When would you think about a transplant? My opthamologist can tell me what can be done and the risks / benefits but it seems like the decision of when to do any treatment is down to me. I'm a little lost and interested in people's thoughts? 
9109,I mean the 21 was when I was holding my breath. I told her that and she tried like 8+ times because it kept beeping at her and then it said 18. The other eye was 16 so assuming pressures are usually pretty symmetrical it seems more likely doesn't it? Because even assuming my thick corneas mean it's 3 less on both isn't a difference of 5 points concerning between eyes? Also why all the downvotes? I'm genuinely just trying to understand my appointment and don't understand the attitude on this sub sometimes. 
9110,"That line you're looking at is probably the 20/40 line on a big eye chart. That means, with rested eyes you can make out the 20/40 letters but if they're tired or strained from staring at your phone, it tips it to not seeing that. Overall you're right around that 20/40 visual acuity. Your eyes at 20 feet are seeing the same size letters that a normal/good corrected eyes can see from about 40 feet away. That's the minimum to be able to drive. To really put it into perspective, go out onto a sidewalk and look for a street sign far enough away that you can just barely make out. Any further away and it's too blurry. Now stop and take note of how far away you are. That distance from the sign... Double it! That's how far the ""normal corrected"" eye can see that sign from. Most people with a healthy retina and a good pair of glasses can even get a bit more distance, a bit better than 20/20. "

Over the last 6-9 months I have been getting twitches all over my body. Started in my hands and feet, now they are all over my body.... legs, shoulders, calves etc. One point I had numbess from my left elbow down to my little finger.... That's fine now though. Every morning I wake up and my legs are so achey.... like I've done a leg workout... when I haven't. Obviously, concerned about these twitches. Got a neurology appointment on the weekend for tests. Obviously you end up thinking about things like ALS if you google symptoms..... Should never do that. I think its more likely to be neuropathy if anything at all. Does this go away? Has anyone had these problems before? Following a kind of AIP diet now, and when I do eat healthy consistently.... I'm fine. Is this just a flare? It's just annoying me. "
9112,"Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, so this advice is based on my personal experiences. CXL isn't designed to improve your vision. It just happens to be a side-effect of the procedure for some. Your vision could get worse after having CXL performed, there is no real way to know until you do the procedure and work towards recovery. CXL is designed to prevent your eye from deteriorating further. Many of the studies I've followed show the degradation slowing or stopping for many in an individuals 30-40s years of age for those who do not have CXL performed. Follow the guidance provided by the doctor for your eye drops and medication to ensure you have the best chance at having a smooth healing process. Keeping your eye moisturized with preservative free drops post-surgery when you can and what not will help immensely with preventing any sort of scarring as I understand it. Based on my personal experience, I'd say you'll be back to normal life probably within 1 week of having the CXL procedure. The first 2 days or so after having CXL done are a bit rough and you'll probably be uncomfortable and struggling to look at anything with a screen, just take it easy on yourself and rest up and recover. My ophthalmologist stated that my vision would normalize within 6-months after having the epi-off CXL procedure performed on my left eye. After a few months I can state that my vision improved a solid bit, but I wanted to push the envelope and get a bit more clarity out of my left eye, so I went forward with Topography-Guided PRK around 1 year after epi-off CXL. I do not feel the Topography-guided PRK procedure provided as much improvement (it provided some, but not as much as I hoped for personally) as I experienced with CXL, but again CXL isn't designed to fix your vision, just to prevent further degradation. Additionally, the Topography-guided PRK procedure was around 3 times the cost of CXL and insurance covered none of that procedure since it isn't medically necessary and technically experimental in the USA.

9113,"Hi, My astigmatism has been progressing. I wear glasses for 15years for nearsightedness but never with axis. When i broke my glasses, my optometrist raised my dioptry of nearsightedness to compensate because i see worse with axis (cylinder; sorry i am no expert) and made a new glasses with slight cylinder of 0.75. Is it common practice and healthy for the eye to do that (more -x for axis)? Even when compensated i still feel like i see worse with that eye.

9115,"I use a Bruder mask: https://www.bruder.com/moist-heat-eye-compress I just microwave it for ~30 seconds until it's hot but not burning and then wear it for 8-10 minutes. For the massage I just do something like this, but I massage really gently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGJqucoHmjs There is a pretty significant difference in eye comfort when I do the compress with massage, I've been doing it for at least 6 months now. I don't really experience much irritation unless I sit in front of my computer too long. When I don't look at screens for a couple days my eyes almost feel good as new. I've used Omega-3 supplements since I can remember, I just upped the dosage to 3000mg because of an optometrist recommendation. I would take them anyway since they have other health benefits. I don't want to be rude or presumptuous, but I was sort of in your position and I completely had to change my career path. I did a 4 year degree in fine arts, and was just starting school for digital animation and visual effects. I loved that sort of stuff and still do, but I realized that I couldn't look at a computer screen for 10+ hours a day for the rest of my life. If I was having these problems at 23, how could I possibly keep it going for decades? I was depressed for a while, I felt like I was meant to do it, but I couldn't because my eyes bothered me so much. Eventually I decided to pursue firefighting, which is what I'm currently doing. It's very different, but still something I can enjoy. And instead of being on computers all day every day, I just use them now as a hobby. If I were you I would take a bit of time off from screens if possible. Try going for a week with no screen time, no reduced blink rate, no dry environments, and see how your eyes feel. I can almost guarantee they would feel amazing. Obviously it's your choice and none of my business, but I don't really think there's another solution as effective as lifestyle change. Good luck no matter what you decide to do. "

9119,"As others have said, you are the only one able to answer the question. There will be risk, some people have better experiences than others with Lasik (e.g. dry eyes, visual artifacts, etc); you could be lucky or you could be unlucky. As others have said you might want to look into alternatives first; especially given that the alternatives aren't permanent like Lasik is. Things like contacts, anti-fatigue lenses (e.g. baby progressives), etc. Personally I am 52 and have equivalent astigmatism to you. I just get by with two sets of glasses. Single vision office glasses for computer work (set 1 diopter in) and +1.25D progressives for general stuff like driving, TV, etc. So the solution to a similar situation for me was two sets of glasses; maybe that would work for you, maybe not. At 41 you seem a bit young for presbyopia (needing reading glasses), but presbyopia eventually comes for us all! You can't avoid presbyopia; you can only learn to live with it. "
9120,"It's possible your eye doctor discovered that you had a hyperopic Rx at age 19, but chose not to prescribe you glasses because you had no visual complaints. It's also possible that your focusing system accommodated through the low powered plus lenses, hiding your hyperopia. If your optometrist performed a cycloplegic (dilated with eye muscle relaxing eye drops) refraction, they could easily measure your hyperopia. I wouldn't be fixated on a +0.50 Rx in your early 20s. I'd say that's the perfect Rx to be at for your age! "
9121,Well had my 13 year old appointment with the Keratoconus surgeon today and the only thing I ended up leaving as is frustrated. Yes I know my daughter has Keratoconus. I have known this since she was officially diagnosed at the age of 10. I don't think I need 5 eye doctors to tell me she has Keratoconus. At this rate I feel like she isn't getting anywhere. I have been told she will need CXL. Again this has been know for 3 years. The surgeon also admit she did not read all of Kimberly's paper work that was sent to her from her previous cornea specialist. So the surgeon put Kimberly back on the same medication that she has been on and wants to see her in three weeks to see if any improvement has been made. At this rate I feel like we aren't getting anywhere. Yes my daughter has other eye issues besides Keratoconus. Now we know she has bacteria Keratitis and blepharitis. 
9122,"I know that those are drastically different options, but here's my story. I'm thirty-one and have been blind since birth due to severe scarring behind my retinas. I started having problems with keratoconus about five years ago, but at first it was very off and on discomfort. Now it is to the point where it is almost constant. I've tried psychllojel, probably not spelling that right, and muro 128. I'm not interested in a cornea transplant since it would do nothing for my eyesight and seems like unnecessary risk and expense. I've only just started reading about cross linking. Does it help with the pain and discomfort, or is it more to correct vision? I have no problem with the idea of having my eye removed, especially if it is the best option for ending the eye pain, but I am trying to get as much info as possible first. Thank you for taking the time to read this. "
9123,People love the optician they usually meet at an optometrist office. They generally don't check yelp or google for local optician to talk to. Most people probably don't even realize optician is a specialized job. Especially when lots of chains are just paying a sales person $12 an hour to be an unlicensed optician at a big box store. Talking to someone in person is better than buying 10 pairs and returning 9 online. But is it also worth $100. I'd guess 99% of people would say no. You'd also need to be seeing 10+ people a day in hopes of making any money. So how are you going to find 2000+ people a year to come to your incredibly specialized office? 
9124,My past eye exams have the sphere measurement of my right eye at -.50. The most recent exam measurement from 3/5 is +.50. Could this be a typo or did my vision change that quickly?

I'm told they only last about 15-20 years so will probably need another one or two in my life time. For those that have had it, what was the recovery like? How long until your sight improved? Are you glad you had it done? Thanks! "

9127,"Moving to rigid scleral contact lenses was life changing for me after getting diagnosed at age 27 two years ago. It's a bummer to not get permanent surgical correction, but getting correction that actually fits the weird way your eyes are is still fantastic. As much as you can help it, try to get descriptions of what is specific to your eyes and ask questions like how thin are the corneas, how much is this progressing (that's likely a question for six months from now), and is cross linking appropriate (for me it wasn't since my cornea was too thin, but fortunately it isn't progressing anymore). One possible upside depending on your life situation is that specialty contacts with KC are often deemed ""medically necessary"" and thus more generously covered by health and vision insurance. I pay nothing out of pocket for my scleral lenses under my current plan and they counted fully towards my deductible under my previous plan. "
9128,"So long story short, my dad and I have the same glasses/prescription. I ran out of contacts and need them for a 3 day trip. He has a pair of expired, unopened contacts that were stored away in a dark place. The date was 4/18. Is there anyway I can clean/disinfect it right after opening and leaving it for awhile to clean just incase? Any ideas/tips? Thank you! "
9129,"I got my full encircling buckle many years ago when I was 30. My detachment was a small hole and I had a lot of lattice degeneration putting the eye at risk for future detachments. After the eye healed from the surgery i had a lot of lasering done in both eyes to tack everything in place. I am obviously not an expert, but this is where I am coming from. I will answer questions as best as I can. "
9130,You can get glasses anytime but it's just that your Rx may change somewhat over time. I'd peronally wait at least until you've regained some sharpness and clarity from the healing process. I think that was maybe 3 or 4 weeks for me. You could get a refraction somewhere and then buy the glasses online cheaply for now. I've had luck with Zenni for cheap rx glasses. The last pair I got at a $30 pricepoint was a pleasant surprise but they have $10 options that are near disposable. I also use Warby for eyeglasses but at a little more cost. These do come from China so expect a few week delay. If you call around and explain why you're not looking for a full exam you may find a deal on a new rx. Check groupon as well or your local university's school of medicine. Heads up that from my experience you want the Rx made manually with a person and not whatever the autorefractor decides. 
9131,"It is clearly written as -.50 on my last two prescriptions. I looked at them yesterday just to make sure I wasn't crazy, at least about this. "
9132,"I'm guessing that if it isn't widespread in 11 years, maybe there might be a reason for that, sadly. "
9133,Astigmatism is very common. We have seen several children under 10 recently with high amounts of it. 
9134,"I guess things become relative after awhile. Sad lol. So I would normally pay like $400 a lens for my type of sclerals... but thankfully my *health* insurance pays for 100% of them because dry eye is a medical condition. Not a cosmetic one that you use for Eye Insurance. I see some pay for Prose lenses up to something like 10 grand, I think. 0_0 Which my doctor is skeptical about those types and the cost. So even if they are a little bit more, I would **definitely not be able to function** with out them and that snowball effect of inflammation because they are dry and then it would get worse. I did worry about money quite a bit and I don't think that helped my health. Tough situation always to be in. But for me I pay $0 with insurance. But it can fluctuate I'm sure. "
9135,Am I developing myopia? Hello 3 weeks ago I had pink eye and after 5 days it went away and my vision became blurred after 4 days of blurred eye and I also got my first shot of covid vac. Now I have headaches everyday and every time except the morning I went to the doc told me there is a scratch on the surface eye Now when I close my blurred eye which had pink eye my headache gets better I have no vision problem history or anything like that Is this myopia?!!!!! Is this possible to get myopia suddenly? Btw I am 21 sorry about my bad English. 
9136,I've NEVER been able to see these. Even back in the 90's when my mom would show me them in the newspaper. She always saw them and I never did. Very frustrating! 
9137,"I do wear an RGP lens, but even with that in I still make use of magnification and enlarged font sizes on a PC.

If you're running that open Ease of Access inside Windows Settings or search for Magnifier to go directly to its settings. On that Ease of Access page there are also display settings to adjust system-wide font sizes, though I take it you've tried that and it's not enough. For most fonts online I'd usually adjust them on a page by page basis using the controls in the browser. "
9138,"No, what will help is giving your eyes more breaks (look into 20-20-20 rule). Most eye strain is not caused by blue light, but by the continues staring at a screen while blinking much less. "
9139,"I'm thinking of asking to be fitted for those again though I just got new RGP lenses which I can only stand for about 4-5 hours in my left eye and my right eye about 10-12 hours before I have to take it out. Your RGP should be a lot cheaper than they're quoting you... until this year I've never had vision insurance. I'm also concerned that I won't be able to tolerate contact lenses at all, in which case it's just money flushed down the drain and my vision will still be screwed up. I'm also concerned about it being jarring going back and forth between the lenses and not. "
9140,"I don't have much insight on jobs you could look into, I'm in the same boat working on a computer all day with truncated glands. What I can suggest in the meantime is a blinking app (reminds to to look away from the computer and blink every 20min). This should help until you find something that works better for you, it's important to maintain what glands you have left. Would you mind sharing your condition on a site called Stuff That Works?

I'm really young, so rejection is still a concern, and I would hate to meet the family only for their sons cornea to fail for me. I would feel so horrible and wouldn't want to burden them with that knowledge. My doctor seemed very willing to answer all my questions about the donor! I'd personally say if the family of the donor hasn't gotten back to you by now, it could be time to move on because they may not be ready too. Transplantation is very bittersweet! "
9142,"I wore contact lenses daily (AirOptix Aqua) from the age of 13 until 22 with 0 issues, but recently I can't wear my astigmatism lens in my left eye. It immediately gets red and starts stinging and, once I remove it, it is dry and bloodshot. Drops don't help either. My right eye is completely fine and I just use a regular lens in that one. My optometrist just keeps telling me I have dry eyes and trying to change my prescription. I've had like 10 appointments since August and nothing has helped to fix this issue with my left eye, not drops, not different prescription lenses...I'm really at my wit's end because I'm really active and really short-sighted and need lenses to partake in sports pretty much. Has anyone else had issues specifically with toric lenses? "
9143,"Tell me if I have this right: Before the injury, you could see well at all distances (from reading to far-off) in both eyes. You suffered a significant blunt-force injury to your left eye, and for a time it was blurry at all distances. At present, your left eye can see sharply at a distance of 12 inches, but further away is blurry. Your right eye **can't** see clearly at 12 inches, but still sees clearly at reading distance and beyond. All correct? "
9144,"I've posted on here a couple of times - thanks so much for the help! I'm yet to see a neuro-ophthalmologist/optometrist because of coronavirus. So will definitely see a professional face to face but have some question in the interim. Healthy eyes since I was little (25F now), only small value astigmatism - regular checkups. Started experiencing eye strain an year ago, blurry vision, lack of stereopsis. After spending too much time reading on this in quarantine (lol), I've established that: - right eye is higher (seems so in photos, when looking afar, and actually also confirmed through a Maddox rod test once) - interestingly, on the cover uncover test it seems that the image from the left eye is higher (is this even possible???) - diplopia in right gaze, right eye is also higher in right gaze - right eye also higher when looking up and to the right - no massive difference in relation to incyclo excyclo torsion - left head tilt with associated SCM and trapezius pain Bottom line, can anybody help me better understand which is the weaker eye muscle? I tried to figure out the anatomy but it beats me haha. Thanks! Later edit: 9 gaze pictures in the comments. "
9145,"Title says it all, really hope to get some no BS advice from the community. So thanks in advanced. My OD suggested I get Eyezen +2 lenses instead of my traditional SV lenses to help relieve eye strain and fatigues. Since I work a desk job and am on my computer 8-9 hours a day. I'm not sold on the added cost and the added ""benefit of the accommodative relief. I also don't have issues with eye strain or fatigue, so no symptoms. What's the community's experience with these lenses and are they worth the extra $40-50? Are they really going to be useful to me? Especially since my prescription is to mainly correct for my astigmatism and I'm not near/farsighted? Was planning on getting polycarbonate lens with a top tier anti glare. It's the added blue light and accommodative relief of the +0.6 diopter in the bottom of the lens I'm not sure of. Also plan on replacing my sun lenses. Prescription: OD: 0 Sphere, -2 Cyl, 3 Axis OS: 0 Sphere, -2 Cyl, 170 Axis Age: Mid to late 20s. "

9147,"I'm a 34 year old guy and started seeing exactly what you're describing when I was 12. Pretty much only see it on lighter colored text with a black or dark background. It really bothers me looking at text on tv and playing video games. It's got worse and worse over the years for me. I've been to many eye doctors and they don't even seem like they care about it. I've told several that it really bothers me and they're just like oh ok. One told me it was my eyeglass prescription and the one he gave me didn't correct it. Another one told me that I had a cataract in my right eye and I'd just have to deal with it because the light is bouncing around in my eye and it can't be corrected. I thought that was weird because it's much worse in my left eye. I went to another eye doctor a month after him and the new guy said I didn't have any cataracts in either eye. He told me that he even has ghosting, but most people don't notice it and I was just a keen observer. It's got really really bad out of my left eye, I see light colored text on a dark background completely double. It's very annoying. What is weird is that black text on a white background is perfectly fine. I went to a cornea specialist and he ran all kinds of test and said my eyes were fine. Had corneal topography done twice, no keratoconus and they said my cornea was shaped near perfect. I'm considering going to an eye hospital that supposed to be pretty good to see if they can get me a solution. "
9148,Makes sense. You'll see worse than -11 pretty routinely. 
9149,"Lots of theories, no one knows for sure at this moment in time. Some studies suggest it could be genetic, other suggest environmental factors. My unscientific theory is excess rubbing of the eyes as a child due to allergies. No one in my extended family has KC or even poor vision in general, but I had terrible allergies as a child and was always rubbing my eyes and then diagnosed with KC at 17 years old. "
9150,"I have KC in both eyes. Right one progressed quite far, left not so much. I can see 20/25 with correction on the left eye. Topography scan shows that left is Keratoconic however. Left side was not Keratoconic until recently. Apparently 99% of the patients get KC in both eyes. It's rare to get it in just one eye and not the other. My left eye was confirmed KC in my 40's. I'm hoping statistics are on my side, and it won't progress any further. "
9151,"I'm also 18 and I've been suffering with very red and dry eyes since I was 14. And like you, I wondered if it's even worth living life if we're not even able to live it to the fullest. Usually at our age we have bacteria and debris (sometimes blepharitis) around our eyelids and eyelashes, these clog our meibomian glands. Adding lid wipes to your regime 2x a day may help. Also my second problem was my eyes not closing at night so now I sleep with an eye mask to help with that. If your eyes aren't closed at night, bacteria and dry air seep in and that leads to more complications. "
9152,"I have had severe myopia since I was little. It's been getting progressively worse as the years went on (currently -19 dp in left eye and -18 dp in my right eye). I haven't really considered doing corrective eye surgery until this year. I scheduled an appointment with a specialist and she told me about the Visian ICL surgery, I was very excited about the prospect of having better vision than I'd ever had, granted my vision would still need to be augmented with LASIK, but still, I was very excited about it. Day of the surgery comes, everything during the surgery seemed to go really smoothly. And I was totally fine after the surgery until the evening. I got a sharp, intense pain in the eye they operated on and had to go back to the clinic for it to be checked. My elevated eye pressure was the culprit (it wasn't too high but was around the high 30s) and they gave me drops to alleviate it. Apparently this is a very rare case and my doctor has never encountered this issue before. They saw me the next three days to check for the pressure, which didn't seem to normalize at all. They tried to do a YAG to create bigger holes for the fluid to escape from, but that proved to be difficult since my iris is really dark. My doctor then decided to do an iridotomy surgically. She expected the fluid to gush out but it never did (she found this further perplexing). So she took out the ICL for my safety, which I totally understand and I'm relived about, frankly. Today, I called the billing office and asked whether I would recompensed partially and their answer was no. Am I valid for feeling like I should be partially recompensed? And if so what can I do about it? "
9153,"Hi I have a question about my new prescription. I am 28 and have worn glasses all my life. I had my eyes tested at a private optometrist in June 2017 and the prescription was: Right: sph -1.25 cyl -0.25 axis 170 Left: sph -1.25 cyl -0.25 axis 55 My new prescription from Boots in June 2020 was: Right: sph -1.50 cyl -0.25 axis 180 Left: sph -1.25 cyl-0.50 axis 160 In short there has been what sounds to me like a big change in axis and slight change in cyl in my left eye. Also a slight change in axis in my right eye. My new glasses arrived today and they seem quite nauseating and distorted. I can read writing from further away with my old glasses. The new glasses seem sharper at a short distance but nevertheless slightly ""swimmy""<U+009D>. I feels like I am straining and it is giving me a bit of a headache. With my old glasses I don't have any of these problems. I've never had this issue with my eyes before when changing prescription. I am also conscious that the boots optometrist had apparently just come back from a funeral when she did my test and clearly was not paying much attention. Not a technical point but a reason for me to question the doubt the prescription... Does anything sound questionable about the new prescription? Is this sort of change in prescription. usual? Do I possibly just need to give the new glasses more time? Thank you! "
9154,"Hi all, My fiance had an eye test in March and the optician said he can't give a formal diagnosis, but after seeing her retinal scan he advised it's a textbook case of Keratoconus. This was around the time Covid hit of course, and our doctor's surgery isn't seeing anyone unless it's deemed to be an emergency. Naturally, she's freaking out about this. She's close to the limit of not being allowed to drive anymore, and we have a small child who she'd very much like to see grow up. We decided to pay for a visit to a private clinic, which was booked months ago but the soonest they could fit us in is this Wednesday. The clinic say they need a pentacam scan before she attends, and referred her to somewhere than could do it. We tried to book that but were informed they had sold their pentacam equipment and don't offer this service any more, but a university hospital 40 miles away do. She called the clinic back several times over the last few months but they didn't get back to her so she left messages. They've now called her back today and said without a scan, there's no point in turning up on Wednesday, and couldn't be of further assistance. But we cant get a scan from the hospital without a referral. It's turning into a bit of a Kafka-esque nightmare. Has anyone got any advice on how to proceed from here? She's overwhelmed by it all (understandably) and is really having trouble coping.

I was 26 when I got my eyes done, my prescription had been stable for years then suddenly my eyes just decided to get a bit worse. My prescription before was -6.0 and -6.5 so quite strong.

9164,"I underwent trans-Prk seven weeks ago (Dec 12). My right eye has healed without a problem. But my left eye has been bothersome. At three weeks post op (around new years eve week), I suffered what I think were three corneal erosions in my left eye (extreme pain caused by opening and closing my eyelids at night). I was seen by my optometrist who put a yellow stain in my eye and noted that I had some dry spots in my eye and noted that due to pattern I may not be closing my eyes fully at night. She told me to use preservative free drops every hour and to put systane night ointment at night if I could not find Muro 128. When I had my third episode, I texted my surgeon who told me to put preservative free drops in my eye every 30 mins and Muro 128 at night for two weeks. I did as instructed and also started Omega 3 Supplements and putting a gel bead eye mask on my eyes two times a day for ten minutes. At night I resorted to taping my eyelids with paper tape just so I felt calm enough to sleep. But I continue to experience daily intermittent pain (pulsating/pulling sensation with a nasal congestion like headache) on my left eye that ranges from 2/10 (aware of it only when I pay attention to it) to 4/10 (I am aware of it but can continue with activities). I get the 4/10 pain at least once a day for 10 mins but today it lasted 1hr to 1.5 hrs. But yesterday, my best day I only experienced pain once (4/10) for 10 to 20 mins before falling asleep. My surgeon told me last week to use Muro 128 for one month this time and continue drops every 30 mins. Also I now have floaters but they don't bother me as much anymore (they dilated my eyes and said no retinal detachment). I am worried that I have corneal neuropathic disease, corneal neuralgia, which I think needs to be addressed promptly to avoid complications. I don't know if I am being overly concerned or if I should be a strong advocate about my symptoms. My next post op is in three weeks (my last post op was 2.5 weeks ago), will I be ok to wait? Should I ask them to assess me right away? Should I ask my optometrist to refer me to get a second opinion? I look forward to some insight. Thanks,. "

My vision without glasses is good on the left eye but when using glasses isn't correcting to 20/20. I need 20/20 due my professional live. Read a lot about this surgery with cxl but didn't find out something recently done. Is it ok this procedure in terms of visual acuity gain? Correct or uncorrected? Leave scars? Can be discovered this procedure in a normal eye check? This new machine Amaris 1050S is amazing but im afraid. Also, during my research, looks like in Canada are the best technology and doctors. Do you agree or I could look for something in other countries? Hope to have some inputs that help me decide to continue planning a surgery with CXL. "
9170,"This is a somewhat subtle question. First, some background: I am a male in my late 30s. For a year I have been having dry eye symptoms. I saw an optometrist last September, who diagnosed the problem are recommended artificial tears. This brought the issue under control, with intermittent flare-ups. However, in August the problem got so bad I saw an ophthalmologist. He diagnosed screen time, eye dandruff (invisible to me) and fire particles (I live in the West) as the culprit, and recommended a regimen of drops, wipes, washes, and allergy drops (Zaditor). By far the thing that helped the most was the Zaditor. But here's the thing: I have never had chronic allergic eye disease before. Only my cat allergies have caused eye problems in the past, and I am no longer around cats. In addition, itching has not bee one of my symptoms. So my question is this: Can a histamine reaction be caused by the dry eyes alone, or must it always be a result of allergens? Might my immune system be releasing histamine in reaction to the dry eyes, in the absence of an allergic trigger? Is it possible to develop an allergic eye disease in my late 30s where itching is not a symptom? "
9171,If I could have got CXL done when I was first diagnosed with KC when I was your age I would have absolutely got CXL. I didn't take the time or money when I was young to get that done. It also was just barely in the trial's period. Long story short 11 years later and my right eye has progressed so bad that I can not get CXL in it. I would so terrible things to be able to get my vision back. Take the time and spend the money to take care of your eyes now! You one have one pair! 
9172,"All my life, I've never had any issues with my eyes. I could be outside all day without sunglasses, and everything would be fine. Now, I'm 34 years old and all of a sudden, when I go outside in the sun, my eyes start hurting (feels dry, almost like it stings...) and I have a very mild headache. It's not intolerable, but more of a nuisance. It lingers a bit in the evening after sunset and the next day, my eyes are fine. If I wear sunglasses, I don't have this problem. I noticed that this started last summer, but it was very mild. This summer, I had to spend a lot of time outdoors, so I'm not sure if something happened to my eyes. What is this caused by? UV rays? Bright light? Is this normal, part of aging? Should I see an optometrist? I wear contact lens. I have to admit, I don't like wearing sunglasses. What can be done about this? "
9173,DMEK can give you 20/20 but not every time. 
9174,I got transplants in both corneas at 20 & 21. I'm 41 now. Vision without sclerals is terrible but I see 20/20 with them in. I've done fairly well with the transplants. 
9175,"It appears that our understanding of this phenomenon comes from a single case reported in 1980. Another study group tried to recreate this phenomenon using a controlled exercise protocol involving 10 patients with PDS. While the researchers noted a minimal increase in both pigment liberation and IOP elevation 15 minutes after exercise, the pressures returned to baseline within 30 minutes. Two additional research teams noted that pigment liberation could be increased in patients with PDS after jogging and bicycling, but with no significant impact on IOP. As long as you are being monitored by your doctor, don't give up exercising. This is one of those things that's often quoted and taught but in reality there's just not enough evidence to show that it occurs in the vast majority of people.

9177,Hi!! So I've had high eye pressure historically but my most recent was 25 in both eyes. For some reason this time I have another appointment to measure cornea thickness I think? The only family history of glaucoma is my moms grandfather had it. How likely will I get prescribed the glaucoma eye drops? What would be the worst case scenario?? I also don't really know how they measure it/what they'll do... Any help is appreciated! 
9178,"As someone who has won the battle with Keratoconus, I like to answer our newly diagnosed people with this message :) First of all, do not panic. KC does NOT mean the end of your eyesight or your world. You are now embarking on a journey, a KC journey. I was diagnosed in 1968 and 1970 when there was no such thing as CXL, Sclerals and transplant procedures were primitive. I had successful transplants (1980, 1982) and I am now in glasses 20/25 and 20/40.. My advice to you is: 1. Not panic 2. Find a doctor and lens fitter that you trust. It's YOUR eyesight. Get a 2nd opinion if you need it. 3. Follow his/her instructions 4. If you have ANY problems or concerns, contact them. Even when it is after clinic hours, there is always someone on call to help. Yes, you have support online, something I didn't have in my day; however run everything you read online by your doctor before any treatment; even advice from me :) There are so many great treatments today. Chances of needing transplants are much slimmer than in my day. You should do fine. Most get relief by CXL and Scleral lenses. I hope this calms your fears a bit :) *****Update,****** July, 2020 Saw my doctor on the 13th. 39 and 41 year old grafts are still clear healthy and I am seeing 20/25 and20/40 in glasses. Next dr apt scheduled in a year. "

The vision is getting worse and things are foggy. My friends at the eye bank (I was on their board of directors 2005-2008; same hospital) emailed me and said they are starting to do elective procedures again at the hospital. I am going to call Monday and see if we can move things up. Let's get this show on the road. I am ready for it to heal and get a scleral lens. :). "

9182,"Even though it was more than 50 years ago, I remember the first clear indication that I had KC quite vividly. You have to understand that at this time KC was much less understood. There was no corneal topography and no treatment except contact lenses that were primitive compared to what is available today. So nobody really looked for it or knew much about it because there wasn't much to know about KC and not a lot you could do if you found it. I started wearing glasses when I was 16 because I needed them to drive. I didn't think much about it at the time but I would see the eye doctor every year to get my prescription updated. One time the doctor joked to an intern that my prescription might change before the end of the appointment. In retrospect, this was probably all early signs of my KC. At one of these yearly exams the doctor was doing the subjective refraction of my left eye with the funky spin the dials ""glasses"", a phoropter, and asking ""which is better 1 or 2?"" I asked ""which of the 2 lines I should be looking at?"" Whereupon he threw back the phoropter and started examining my left eye like crazy. Not being able to figure it out, he referred me to an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist was not able to figure it out and referred me to a retinal specialist. Obviously the retinal specialist didn't find anything. So I carried on with my glasses. At this point my right eye was fine and carried the load. A few years later my ophthalmologist must have gone to a seminar where someone talked about KC because he looked at me and said ""you've got keratoconus."" He fit me with a trial contact lens and I was amazed by the improvement in vision. Unfortunately, in those days going from being able to put a trial lens on a KC eye for a few minutes and dispensing a contact lens you could wear all day was not easy. I spent a lot of time and money and saw a lot of doctors before I got contact lenses I could wear all day. "
9183,"Sometimes, when I'm in a pitch black room i see flashes of white lights in my peripheral vision when i move my eyes/head.

Also, after about 5 minutes in the dark my eyes ""adjust and the flashing lights go away. This also happens in ""episodes. I'll go like a month or two without it happening, and then it will happen for 5-7 days in a row then go away again. Is this something i should see my doctor for? It really doesn't bother me, but it would be nice to know why it happens. Does anyone here have any ideas as to why this happens or what it could be? "
9184,"Hello, According to your information, you report a history of an apparently sudden onset of monocular diplopia, which corresponds to using Amitriptyline for pelvic pain, with a recent OCT exam returning normal, and a manifest refraction indicating a slightly myopic and astigmatic refractive error. Additionally from what I read, your age is relatively young, only the right eye is affected, the diplopia is vertical in alignment, and your ophthalmologist mentioned a slight ""capping? I don't know what that means. I will explain the following: Since the diplopia resolves with a pinhole, it is most likely refractive in origin. A vertical or horizontal alignment of the ghosting almost always points to regular astigmatism, although many different causes can be possible, like dry eyes. However, what I am concerned about is that you seem to describe the onset of the diplopia as relatively sudden, for which regular astigmatism or dry eyes usually doesn't cause. I will ask you some questions: 1. Could you remember the moment the first onset appeared? Do you know exactly when it first happened? What were you doing at the time? From my experience, I've seen many people with quite a ""snap change in their vision similar to this for no apparent reason. (Actually, I have the same condition myself, too. ""Snap it is, no warning at all.) Are you actually experiencing this ""snap? 2. What does the word ""capping as said by your doctor, actually mean? 3. Do you experience any pain or discomfort within, around, or between your eyes, any headaches, excessive tearing? If so, how well do they correlate with near activities, or are they random? 4. Do you have any sensation that something might be in your eyes, any itchiness, redness, irritation, or excessive discharge? 5. Do you suffer from allergies? 6. Does anyone in your family suffer from dry eyes? 7. Does your vision fluctuate throughout the day, or even with each blink? In response to your question, yes, astigmatism can occur with people in their 20s. This is normal. "
9185,"It's way worse than I thought it would be but I am determined to do something each day may last 15 minutes, I may last most of the day  just don't want to stay in bed. We are all fighters and encourage each other. I really wish we could all get help with the medical expenses. "
9186,"In 1968, I was 14. In school, they had vision screenings and I tested poorly in both eyes. Our Optometrist was a family friend. He was able to refract my left eye but not the right. He didn't say anything about KC but immediately, referred me to an Ophthalmologist who diagnosed me. I am sure he knew what I had but wanted me to see someone more trained. Two years later, the left eye developed KC. Ah yes, years of RGP lenses, Sigh! "
9187,"I know there aren't many of us here. But I'm frustrated that, as CXL is the mainstay of treatment in KC in preventing progression, that there aren't 20 replies?! I am assuming with hope that this is because after their cxl is done healing everyone doesn't need to hang around here because their vision and loves are normal. "
9188,"You should worry more about something that can actually happen to you than the potentiality of developing KC. If you don't have it now by 18, stop worrying about it. "
9189,"I'm currently trying out ortho k lenses, and am finding them to be pretty good but find my vision fades to around -2/-3 by the end of the day, with a lot of halos/starbusts in low light, though granted I've only been using them for a few weeks. My prescription is -8 sphere both eyes and -0.5 cylinder. I'm also 25. I've been looking into other options just in case they don't work out and ideally want good night vision (am also interested in sports like tennis, swimming, scuba diving). I've figured my options include: - Lasik (though am concerned about permanent halo's, starbusts etc, poor night vision, getting dry eyes and having a big chunk of healthy cornea removed), - SMILE (only a few people do this in my area and apparently not as good for high prescriptions?) - ICL (possibly Evo Visian, and seems like the best option as it's reversible, but apparently they only remove only if necessary is the most invasive/expensive one) I'd be curious to hear your thoughts?

9190,I've had five TMJ surgeries. First was when I was 18. Doc was amazed at the amount of scar tissue in there. Another at 19 and again at 20. Just as bad. Another at 34 and final complete removal of joints at 36. I now have bilateral custom made titanium and plastic joints. For years we couldn't figure out the cause. Last year when I was diagnosed I spoke to my oral surgeon and he was positive it's due to having an autoimmune disease. 
9191,"I'm 17 and had perfect vision until I was 15 then I got glasses for both nearsightedness and farsightednes, oh and astigmatism. On top of that I developed what I believe is vision snow.

The symptoms are double vision, floaters, glare, after images, static, dry eyes etc. And I'm super terrified and anxious about my symptoms worsening or me going completely blind. Are my fears irrational? From what I've heard VSS doesn't lead to it and I have no family history of blindess, although my grandfather got glaucoma in his late 70s which doesn't count right? And as much as I hate to say it, I really feel like my vision symptoms have made my quality of life worse than it would be if I had 20/20 vision. What Can I DO IM SO Anxious And Scared.

9194,"Note. This is a cross post from r/optometry. I apologize, as I am new to reddit, and didnt realize this subreddit existed. And I dont know how to delete the post from r/optometry. I have a question about my eyes. I had PRK done about 5 years ago. My surgeon has told me during my annual checkups that my vision in 20-20. Though I dont beleive her. One of my eyes is near sighted, and the other is far sighted. Its not a problem I ever had before. Recently, Ive noticed my eyesight being much blurry. I dont know if its due to some of the topical medicine I apply for hairloss (finasteride and minoxidil). Im also not sure if it could be allergy related. Does anyone have any thoughts they could share? In addition, I have another question thats a little hard to explain. So my right-eye is my dominant eye. When I close my right eye, and look out only my left, is it normal for my brain to have difficulty processing information? I feel like even though my right eye is closed, my brain still wants to use my right eye. So when my left eye is open, its almost as though I am seeing everything with my left eye *as well as* the eyelid of my right eye. "

If you are feeling burning, you have got to apply the drops they prescribed for you. Now, almost 3 years after my procedure, I wear a kerasoft lens on that eye and no issues. "

Now, like the idiotic hypochondriac that I am, it makes me hate going to the doctors because I assume I'm always going to hear that something is wrong with me, so no I do not have an eye doctor. But, I called right away and schedule an appointment at a nearby ophthalmology place but I won't be able to be seen until late August. So I've just been dealing with this and my anxiety is already pretty bad especially when it comes to my health so this is eating me up trying not to worry about it. I've gotten eye drops from CVS and while they seem to provide temporarily relief to the strain and occasional dry feeling, my vision is still not what it used to be and I'm afraid it's going to be something serious. I'm thinking it could be related to migraines but they haven't been hitting me hard during this stint of problems with my vision. Like, I can feel that my head hurts but it comes and goes.

The mid 30s doc that owned the practice was so good we would see patients come from other counties to see him for specialty lenses. That being said, I think you're worrying about the right thing (knowledge, past success) but you're basing those worries on things that aren't necessarily factors. My current boss owns a 1 doc practice, has 3 managers running his business, has decades of experience and all the time in the world for CE, and though I love him, he is complete rubbish with sclerals.

9203,"So i developed floaters 2 years ago and immediately saw my ophthalmologist who said that they could go away or i'll get used to them and i had no other eye problems apart from myopia (-2). Fast forward two years and these floaters have really impacted my life in a negative way. I feel instantly down when i see them and i never like going outside on sunny days like i had done. When i see them it just lets me know everyday that i have floaters and it looks like a dirty bathroom window in my eyes. I've read a lot on forums etc and it seems that there is little research being done in floaters and i cant wait 10 years before there is something safer than a vitrectomy. So, i wanted to know if a floater only vitrectomy is really that bad? I know i could get a cataract but cataracts are one of the most popular eye surgeries and from my understanding a cataract surgery could also fix my myopia. Im just worried that these surgeries could cause further damage like permanent bloodshot eyes, blindness, wonky eye etc. I have read also that some people have had floaters come back after a FOV, but inducing a PVD will avoid this i believe?

I should note that her and I do know that in some cases myopia can continue to worsen past that age range. She went the place where she gets her glasses 3 times in the last 4 months trying to get contacts made and they apparently said this was the best they could do. I have been unable to attend the meetings and she is not 100% about certain things. I'm going to get more involved. She doesn't know her current contact lens prescription. Her last one is -9 and -10 apparently. I do not like her office she goes to. We have been told they are the only ones her in N FL that can help locally.

Both times, my eye ended up drifting again (although, to be fair, my eye was under corrected to begin with last time - but still). I'm terrified that even after lucky number 3, my eye will go right back to being walled. I shouldn't be so scared, I know. This surgery is really common and quite easy, and my surgeon is one of the best in New England, and he's quite confident that this one will stick - but regardless, I can't help it. Is there anyone here who has had to have multiple surgeries for strabismus? Or who can maybe offer up some words of wisdom for me? I'm just really really freaked out :( Thanks. "
9210,"Oh yeah. 18 years of symptoms before diagnosis. Fatigue, joint pain, dry eyes, dry mouth, digestive problems. There were periods in that time frame when I spent months barely able to leave my house. But then other periods when I felt great for extended periods of time. My 30s and most of my 40s were spent fluctuating between feeling great and living a normal life and being almost completely debilitated. Never got an answer from doctors. Mainly it was dismissed as poor lifestyle habits and depression. But antidepressant drugs never helped and I wasn't able to force myself through exercise during bad periods.

9212,I had a pretty horrible chalazion on the upper eyelid of this eye from April-October. Resolved slowly with heat compress and an antibiotic regime. Yesterday I woke up to pain on the lower lid of the same eye and I have three lesions/bumps/ulcers on the internal lower lid. I'm trying to book an appointment but just wanted to seek advice on if this could be something that requires urgent/emergency care? I can handle the pain and will wait if it's just another blocked oil gland... I also should mention when I was in high school (10-12 years ago) I had to take topical medication for blepharitis. Edit: I've also woken up to crust scaling on the lash line the last few mornings.

I've been on an anti-inflammatory diet for coming up on two yrs now and the joint pain hasn't come back. (Zero added sugars, zero gluten, lots of vegetables, etc.) I still have problems with dryness (house is super-dry here), though.

9215,"I recently moved, went to a new optometrist (who I don't really like), and had a slight change in my years-old prescription. Old: -2.50 |. -1.75 New: -2.75 |. -1.75 (ADD +2 in both eyes) Background 1: Like many, I use my insurance for contacts and buy glasses online (I know, I know). With the new script I ordered the exact frames I got last time. I was shocked at how much thicker a .25 change made the lens on the edge! This particular lens is 54mm wide and 34mm high. I decided to return these glasses (for a few reasons). Question 1: The new frames I'll be trying are lens width of 53mm and height of 33mm. So, very similar. Would a Trivex lens make any noticeable difference at my prescription compared to CR39? Background 2: I crossed the [Brimley Line](https://brimleyline. date/) this year and my presbyopia has become impossible to ignore. My ADD is +2. I've only ever used single-vision contacts before, so my new doc had me try a pair of multifocal contacts. After a few minutes of blinking everything was still blurry. He said, ""they don't work for everyone."" Then he set me up with a pair of monovision lenses. I tried them for a week and couldn't really get it to work well. I could read, but distance was always blurry. I also noticed a lack of depth perception. He said, ""doesn't sound that works for you. You'll have to use readers."" and prescribed the same lenses I've always had with the change above. Question 2: Are there other brands/types of multifocals my doc should've tried? I'm stuck for this year, but I have no issue going somewhere else next time. Question 3 (and 3b): Are progressive lenses worth it for my my glasses? Do they require taller lenses? "
9216,I am 49 and am from USA. My prescription was 4.25 in this eye. As I could remember they tried to fix this large macula off issue fast because in this day I have seen normal in the morning but in just 6 hours I was large loss of vision. If macula off is short period of time it is possible to return vision to normal. I was previous day in different doctor when I have seen first symptoms but I was told everything is fine. For this reason I think fast action with retinopexy was fine solution to stop damage to eye. In some cases they use retinopaxy to stop detachment before surgery. This new break was in the same area and it just started something to happen. It was not new detachment and they just added more gas and laser to fix it. I suppose for any new issue they will send me to surgery. I have had the similiar issue with left eye. They tried retinopexy but after 5 days it was new break which was not able to fix with retinopexy and they send me to vitroctemy because it was tractional detachment caused by previous cataract surgery. Today vision is 25/20 and I have some issue with periferial vision. 
9217,"I work on computers 12+ hours a day. **Question**: Can Computer Vision Syndrome Cause it? Question: I'm 28 and I do not know how it could have gone undiagnosed so long. Could CVS have exposed the weaknesses in my muscles? He did not mention CI in prior visits. **Statement:** I have had strabimus all my life (there are baby pictures), but in his eyes its not true strabimus, because i can make my eyes focus together (you would not know I have strabismus) and allow them to turn out (exotropia) at will or when Im to exhausted its more prone to turn out. Somehow during childhood **I did not develop a lazy eye and vision in both eyes is the same** and i was able to self correct strabimus to the point where I have it, but I can make my eyes focus at will. (and hide it so long as im not tired). **Question:** Is Convergence Insufficiency comorbid with strabismus? Or could it just be CI and not strabismus? After all my eyes are not teaming together, is it because of strabismus or CI? **Question:** Am i a candidate for vision therapy to correct this? **Anxiety oriented Question:** This is my health anxiety issue, but any chance this was caused by a stroke or a tumor or cranial nerve damage I don't know about? Or would there be other symptoms in addition? "
9218,"Everyone's experience is different -- a lot of people do really well on methotrexate. I've been on Plaquenil for 6ish years. I've tried adding sulfazaline, then when that didn't help/side effects were too bad we went to methotrexate (tried both forms). Didn't like those side effects/pain levels either, so now I'm on Plaquenil and leflunomide (Arava). Doing okay, but I have to take fiber supplements daily for side effects. I'm actually switching Rheumies because my last doctor never explained anything, just kept throwing a new drug at me. New doctor is supposed to be very informative and helpful. I have to figure out how to work another 30 years if possible, so getting things under control NOW is important to me. "

If you managed to go several years with only a slight change and you're only 21 (an age when eyes are still developing), personally I don't think you need to worry about KC. "

9221,"Hi, despite being 19, my myopia is still steadily increasing, going from a contacts prescription of -5.5 to -6.5 in 10 months. I don't recall what my glasses prescription was last year, but they are now currently at -7. I used Ortho-K from when my myopia was first discovered at age 8, until I was 18, this being my first year off Ortho-K. I was wondering if I should go back to Ortho-K seeing how much my vision has deteriorated, but my concern is if Ortho-K even works at my level of myopia as I was told it works best on patients under -6 diopters. Im also thinking of using atropine, but it seems that atropine has a rebound effect where it won't be effective after a year and your eyes will rapidly deteriorate. I also don't know how effective these will be since I saw that both atropine and Ortho-K was primarily used as myopia control for children. "

9223,"Hello, I'm a 27M in Washington. Over a year ago I unfortunately learned what a corneal abrasion is. I saw an eye doctor and eventually came to using a steroid and ointment before bed. That worked most of the time for several months. I got the rona and was in the ICU for a week and had no eye problems without ointment or steroid. During my recovery at home after I got abrasions again and am now on my current solution which is wearing contacts while I'm sleeping and waking up every few hours to drink water and use eye drops. For some reason during the night I get dehydrated and my eyelids will suction to my eyes and tear my cornea. If I drink water and use eye drops every few hours during the night most mornings I can get up and be totally fine, but sometimes even with contacts during the night I wake up with that searing pain for up to an hour before my eyes heal enough to blink without pain and just blurry vision. Anyone have experience with this or have any idea what's going on or what I can try? "

They were actually super easy to insert myself and my doctor said I was a natural. It took me three tries on the right and two on the left. Then, for practice, I took them out and reinserted them both but I got them in on the first try this time! Did you have any trouble getting yours in? "
9226,i m the same guy deleting that account. even my c3r had same experience and same restrictions. in c3r uv light is given in order to stop kc at early stage. but is it true that i would have to live with drops for rest of life? becoz after my treatment of c3r i had drops every hour even at night on 1st day then it stopped at night other day but continued in day-time for a week. after 4 months i wont have have to add any drops. is that the same in your case? i am 21 and i also detected kc in2015 at very early stage so i can stop it. there's no way to recover except transplant. but i can see with glasses on so it's fine. if it occurs again i will have my 3rd surgery after 3-5 yrs. 
9227,"TL;DR have had glasses for c. 15 years since I was a young child. Been wanting to get rid of them for 7 years since I was in my early teens. Cant wear contacts. Went for a LASIK consult at a top London clinic & they said no as they diagnosed keratoconus and dry eye disease. They also said no to ICL as my anterior chamber is too small (borderline; 2.79mm instead of the 2.8mm they require) Tried to contact Moorfields Private but has not gone well and it's put me off slightly from booking a consultation (taking months to reply to an enquiry/not responding until I got hold of their email 3 months later, replying with enquiries concerning other people - breaching GDPR? Taking almost a week to reply to my latest email when before they took less than 48h) Another clinic I'm looking at (Focus clinic) also needs a min anterior chamber depth of 2.8mm and my prescription isn't strong enough for them; they usually need -8 and above mine's -2.75 and +3 but 2 places advised against LASIK in my circumstances. Is it worth trying to get a second opinion if they'll say no again? Any advice/recommendations of clinics to go to to get a second opinion in central London/Harley St and around that area that aren't chains would be amazing. Backstory; I've had glasses since I was maybe about 5? I've wanted to get rid of them since I was about 13/14 When I was old enough (ie finished school) went to a clinic to go for a consultation (London Vision Clinic/Dan Reinstein, one of the top LASIK docs in the world at the moment) and they said wait 18months bc they thought I possibly had Keratoconus and basically confirmed that after 18months (when I told them I struggled with contact lenses, I was referred to a specialist in making contacts for keratoconus who diagnosed me with meibomian gland dysfunction/anterior blepharitis - dry eye. I've tried a lot to help the problem and nothing has really helped but that's beside the point). So obviously they ruled out LASIK etc based on those factors. They mentioned ICL and then retook my measurements and said they wouldn't do it, because my anterior chamber is too shallow. They told me that they won't do it on anything below 2.8mm depth and told me mine is either 2.78 or 2.79 (I'm about 95% sure it's 2.79mm) even though I found a 2019 article discussing visual outcomes (at least short term) for high myopics with shallow anterior chambers between 2.65 and 2.79mm. I'm not highly myopic (as of March 2021 my left eye is -2.75 with -0.75 cylinder of astigmatism, my right eye is +3 with -3.5 cylinder of astigmatism) but I know LASIK would be a terrible choice in this circumstance (also verified at the London Opthalmology Centre). Was looking at Moorfields Private but have had issues with communication even before making an appt which puts me off. Filled out enquiry form for them in August, still haven't responded to that even tho it has my entire history with eye issues. Tweeted them calling it out last wk & got their email address. Emailed them and a day later got a response addressed to someone else with their name and enquiry which could be a mistake but is that not breaking GDPR? Tweeted them again and got an actual response. Asked a few questions about when they book you in for surgery following the consult (when I went to LVC they had to schedule the consult and the surgery at the same time and within a few weeks of each other. I enquired whether they do the same) and got a response within 48 hours. Replied last Wednesday afternoon asking when I could book a consultation and stating my available dates and they still haven't got back to me and based on my previous experience with the online enquiry, I don't think they will. The new patient team's operating hours are Mon to Fri, 8am-6pm, I replied Wednesday afternoon at 3:35pm. They had almost 2 and a half hours to reply on the Wednesday and have had 10 hours on Thursday, 10 hours Friday, 10 hours yesterday & 10 hours today to reply and they still haven't which I find all in all really unprofessional. (If you have any recommendations of clinics to visit for consultations that ideally are in Harley St/nearby in Central London and aren't chains, let m know please. Thanks!) I was looking at Focus Clinic who have a 100% success rate of 20/20 vision for their LASIK (don't know about their 20/20 success rate for ICLs, although it won't be 100%. I'd love to have 20/20 vision but was told they can only correct for what my glasses are which is 20/35 which I'm v happy if I get that) but their suitability criteria is being between 21 and 60 (â<c5>""…) anterior chamber depth of 2.8mm or more (âŒ) and usually refractive errors -8 or higher. (again âŒ) Is there any point going for another consult in case they say no again? "

9232,"Biofinity XR is one of the only soft contact lenses that have a range of +10 and then you add the astigmatism. Can I ask why you're looking for an alternative? My experience has been that patients are satisfied with the comfort and BF has excellent toric stability. The only other soft toric lens I can think of that fits those parameters is the Proclear Toric XR which is also manufactured by CooperVision and is the older version of BF. It's a hydrogel lens with a lower Dk/t. I think the only other option would be a hybrid or gas permeable lens but if your issue is comfort then the BF is still your best bet. If the issue is vision then a scleral lens is actually fairly comfortable, provides excellent vision, but is very expensive and the fitting process is longer. "

9234,"I went carnivore last Feb. Getting rid of plant matter was instrumental in putting my auto immune problems into remission. I went GF in Sept 2019. Then lowered my carbs by half and included a bit more fats. It helped, but I was literally projectile vomiting my veggies. Nothing else. So, I trialled carnivore for a month. I just kept going. I had ZERO desire for carbs and plant matter. I can tell straight away now if any food affects me. The only flare up I've had of Sjogren's was a day after I had some thick cream with carrageenan in it. My eyes dried up so badly that I had to leave work and pour night ointment into my eyes for two days. I get a little mouth and throat dry from yoghurt now and then. I stick to a tablespoon at a time if I feel the need for any yoghurt. But I can cope with aged cheeses and cream the best. My gut gets a little iffy if I have more than 1/4 cup of milk every week or so. There is a LOT of conflicting nutritional information out there, and it is getting worse over time. All the roads I looked at lead me to an elimination diet and carnivore made the most sense. I do eat organ meats, a wide variety of animal fat sources, a bit of seafood on occassion, bone broth almost daily and dairy as an extra energy source. I do have decaf coffee semi regularly and will slam down 2 squares of Lindt 95% dark choc if at work and need a quick food intake - especially if doing overtime and a heavy job (I'm a truck mechanic). But there is a lot of overwhelming anecdotal evidence regarding the effect of bioavailability of animal sources for micronutrients. I wanted the biggest bang for my food buck. Low density food, with low effect on my gut, with high bioavailable micros. A small piece of liver ain't sexy, but it costs my body less to extract the high level nutrients than the equivalent in muscle meat and plant matter. If you are ok eating meat and animal fats, it is certainly worth trying for a month. Resources such as Ken Berry, Paul Mason, r/zerocarb, Carnivore Yogi, Grassfed Girl, Shawn Baker, Paul Saladino (to a degree), Sally Norton, Mary Ruddick, Natasha Campbell-Mc Bride (I hope I got her hypened surnane right!), Elliot Overton, Judy Cho, Pran Yoganathan, Rob Cywes etc are good starts. Just be very mindful of electrolytes early on. "

9236,"this. Also, u/DoodleDoodle1, no in other countries CXL is not a preventive measure. I come from Italy, and I can tell you the protocol is always to wait till there is a proven progression. Italy, Greece, Germany, Switzerland are definitely number one in KC treatment. They used to do epi-off CXL since 18 years now, and epi-on (with iontophoresis) for at least 6 years. Nowadays in certain cases, i.e. for extremely young patients, it is usually done very soon after it's discovered, but it's not done normally if there is no ascertained progression. In the US sometimes they do it as a preventive measure regardless of age, but that is a mistake according to basically every protocol out there. A mistake that I unfortunately also made as I came to the US. Got monitored for 10 years in Italy, no progression beyond that in my 20ies (37 now). As I came to the US the doctor I was seeing here scared me into having CXL, with the result that my vision got much worse, even if it was epi on. I tought epi-on did not have risks: it definitely has risks, i.e. the risk of a severe loss of vision. Better to monitor, since in many cases progression has halted at our age. We know that pregnancies might trigger progression once again: I think for those who have KC, during pregnancy you should monitor very very closely progression and intervene as soon as there is a hint of progression.

9237,"Well I am having troubles in my eyes since the past 1 and a half years or so, I have all sorts of problems such as Visual Snow Syndrome,Double Vision (Ghosting effect) in both eyes, Dry eyes that is this bad that when I blink (Sometimes my eyes becomes foggy and all I see is like looking through fogged eyeglasses or fogged windshield of the car) but after I blink several times again it goes away, Tried over 6 different prescription eye drops (Sadly none of them helped), Also when I wake up in the morning, I notice debri around my eyelashes is solid like a rock and the first thing I do when I wake up is to put some lubricating eye drops in, so the discharge from the eyes become little (slimy or gooey) and wash it off thoroughly. Also the lights at night have severe ghosting (as I mentioned above) and have weird rainbow like patterns (kind of starburts but spreading all the wayy around in the glare of the lights) and as well as Light streaks when I blink or squint. And my eyeglasses prescription is Sph -1.75 Cyl -0.50 X 160 in Left eye and in the right it is Sph -1.00 Cyl -1.00 X 180, I am constantly wearing eyeglasses (the doctor which I consulted said not to wear contact lenses as I have some form of severe dry eyes) but sadly it just makes the ghosting plus my symptoms and my vision clearer that's it. It dosen't help much in any of my symptoms. Changed my eyeglasses prescription thrice and it too sadly didn't help. And I have white like snow eyes with no redness nor itchiness and irritation, Just dryness. I was diagnosed with Convergence insufficiency, however but in my recent visit they said it's gone as I did eye exercises (Brock string and Hart Chart) extensively over the period of 1.5 months. Sadly it didn't helped much as well. Gone to Several Eye doctors (5 to be precise) no one was able to find out what's wrong with my eyes and no one diagnosed me with visual snow, I learnt about it from a youtube Channel (Doctor Eye Health) and other posts online.

I bought glasses from Zenni Optical and I really like how it looks but headaches and focusing issues are driving me nuts. I returned my first pair after the agent said that I needed polycharbonate instead of ""normal"" lenses and my second pair with poly lense have the same issues. When reading staring at my monitor the text has fuzzy borders but if i open my eyes really wide its clear. My prescriptions a little wacky as my left eye is -4.75 but my right eye is -2.0. I have a feeling that I've narrowed down the issue to a curve thing. If I bend the glasses so that they are a little flatter everything suddenly becomes super clear and nice so I assume its that. I've already had this current pair for a week and a half and had the first pair for 2 weeks to get used to them. The last pair that I used was almost 100% flat so I was wondering if i should wait a bit longer or just return them now. Thank you ! "

9244,"LASIK doesn't change how long your eyeball is though lol. The longer your eye, the more at risk you are for issues at the retina / back of your eye cause it is too stretched out. That's why these continued eye exams are so important! Vitreous retraction occurs at various ages, different ages for different people, and it is not unheard of to occur as early as 20s or 30s. But while it is a normal process associated with aging/growth, it can cause things to go wrong as it pulls off the retina, either causing things like retinal holes or tears or a macular pucker/hole. I don't think you have these issues thankfully (you would have visual signs), but it's always good to be safe and monitor these things. I'm sure the goal of this appointment is just to do some OCT imaging and to monitor it until the vitreous detachment process is complete and your retina is intact and healthy. No worries, it's always great and a blessing when you can monitor these things and be extra cautious. "
9245,"Yeah, your sphere powers are tiny; definitely don't need high index for that. I order polycarbonate if the sphere is larger than 4.00 and high index if the sphere is larger than 6.00 because sphere makes the lenses much thicker. Cylinder power has a much, much smaller effect on lens thickness than sphere power. I likely wouldn't even bother with poly in your case; just basic CR-39. Google ""lens material refractive index abbe value"" and there are all kinds of charts that show CR-39 has much, much less chromatic aberration than either high index or polycarbonate. So if you don't need poly / hi index (where the thickness of the lens causes distortion at the edges), you'll often see better with CR-39. "

Axis: 17) OS (Sph: -5.00 Cyl: -0.75 Axis: 10) I've been experiencing headaches and eyestrain since early November, and I just went to see my eye doctor in late December. He updated my prescription to the one above, and he said the difference should be enough to explain the headaches and strain. Now, I've been wearing these new glasses and contacts for about two weeks. My vision seems perfectly fine, and I have no complaints about that. However, I'm still having the same problems I was having before. I'm fine first thing in the morning, but my eyes start hurting as soon as I'm exposed to the light (it could be from the squinting.) My eyes constantly feel tired when I wear my glasses, and closing them is the only way to make them feel better. This happens at all times of the day regardless of how much time I spend on the computer. Sometimes, it's better with my contacts, but not always. I also get headaches that extend up into my forehead. I work on a computer, and sometimes the headaches come in a sudden pulse whenever I switch between windows and have to re-focus on something It seems like all the symptoms of eyestrain.

My GP noticed I had dry mouth (despite drinking nearly 100 oz of water in the 24 hours prior) and agreed that I could have Sjogrens. I researched it afterwards/found this sub and it was a perfect match for the issues I've been having/I felt confident that the labs would be positive. Well, they weren't!

Had to pull over countless times to try and find an rgp under my seat or out of my carpet etc. Sclarels by comparison are larger, take a little more practice to put in, but you will never see the edge of them, and you won't feel them pretty much ever.

So I've always been getting new glasses at least every year to 2 years, and am Used to normal everyday issues with wearing glasses that you just get used to and don't think anything of! However recently I ran into a spot of money around the same time I needed my prescription updating so thought I'd splash out on a better pair of glasses, as the glasses I've worn throughout my life went from there everyday glasses, to ray band, to even vintage frames. And the lenses I've been using have almost always been Nikon, which I assumed wear the best! However as I said I ran into some money and wanted to treat myself! So I searched for the perfect frames for me! I ended up purchasing a custom pair from ""LINDBERG""<U+009D> and let me tell you I have never been happier! They are so comfortable, stylish, lightweight, sturdy, and over all 100 times better than any other pair of glasses I have ever seen or tried! I never even have to straighten them or anything they are always perfect even if I fail asleep with them in by accident (admittedly after a few glasses of red) they are always perfectly straight ! Yes they are extremely pricey (and I mean it) but if you have the money and want a frame that will shock you with how amazing they are then look no further! They don't even have any screws ! So don't worry about your lenses falling out after a screw comes loose! And the lens that I have in them are from HOYA, and let me tell y out they are comely flat no curve so my eyes don't look massive! God knows how they're tok but I've never seen so clearly, in my life, they took a day or so to get sued to as the curve difference is a bit strange for the first few hours but after that my vision had been exceptional, the lenses somehow seem to stray cleaner for longer aswell! The lenses I haven are thin even with my prescription and still have all the coating I wanted ! Yeah hey have the blue block to stop my aura migraines, they have scratch proofing, they have the light reacting sunglasses tinting, EVERYTHING! So if you take anything from this rant, take this... Lindberg Glasses With Hoya Lenses Are The Ultimate Glasses. "
9260,"( x-posted in r/glasses ) Hey there, So I've had absolutely awful vision for as long as I can remember, getting glasses as a toddler, and started wearing contacts around age 12 (I'm now 30). My most current contact prescription is +7.5 in both eyes. They correct me quite well and I'm grateful for them given how bad my script is. Anyway, I'm about to have a baby in November and I'm dreading the waking-up-every-3-hours mostly due to the fact that it's going to be a PITA to put my contacts in and take them out constantly. I hardly EVER wear my glasses and I've had the same pair since 2013, if not earlier. Obviously this is for aesthetic reasons, as my eyeballs become the size of an actual bug when wearing them. So I'm seeking a new pair and started doing some research. I have an appointment in 2 weeks, but wanted to get a little educated on my options before going in. I've gathered it will be to my benefit to ask about aspheric lenses and/or high index lenses. I care mostly about the magnification effect moreso than the actual frame thickness, which I've read the aspheric lenses can help with especially for corrections above +4.0. I have no idea if this option was even around in 2013, but I'm hoping it's a newer technology that would at least let me feel comfortable wearing my glasses out of the house once in a while. Would the high index lenses of 1.74 also minimize this effect, or is it strictly for thinning out the lens profile? Any other suggestions or points I should ask my optometrist about finding the right fit for me? I've also read these types of lenses can be quite expensive; are we still talking in the hundreds or will it be upwards of $1000 with frame cost? Definitely willing to dish out for something I would be using every day, just want to get a gauge on it, haha. Would you recommend I order through a brick and mortar store or are there websites I can also order high prescription lenses from? Lastly, what kind of expectation should I have for what my eyes will actually look like if I can find the right lenses? I don't expect to have ZERO magnification, but will these still be embarrassing to wear in public? (apologies for being so vain.) TIA for any help! "
9261,"In my case, the fertility specialist that tracked my pregnancies right after implantation said that Sjogrens wasn't a factor for my miscarriages, but was something they needed to keep an eye on when I ""graduated"" to the maternal-fetal-medicine doctor. The MFM said they just added in a few extra heart focused ultrasounds, but in their experience it was very rare and there were interventions they could take if they caught any issues early enough. I lost 6 pregnancies between kids, two were in the second trimester, one had a bladder defect that was not associated with Sjogrens. I got diagnosed after my 2nd pregnancy loss after visits to every specialist my OBGYN would throw me at, which is how I wound up at a fertility office (we weren't doing fertility treatments, but needed all the genetic testing and early tracking) and a rheumatologist. It was a really hard experience, but in my particular case it wasn't directly caused by Sjogrens. My first pregnancy was relatively uneventful - I got pregnant right away and the whole pregnancy was easy right up until I developed high blood pressure near the end and had to deliver at 36 weeks. Then we had the recurring pregnancy losses, and finally another pregnancy that was closely monitored and measured every step along the way. Everything was completely fine, not a single issue and we even made it all the way to a planned induction at 39 weeks without a major blood pressure spike. So Sjogrens is not necessarily going to mess up your hopes for a family. "
9262,"I had 2020 eye sight in my early childhood. I'm 17 now and I need glasses because I have trouble seeing things far away. I noticed this deficit in my sight in grade 9 (freshman year) but I only went to the optometrist last year (right before lockdown) but never got glasses. I'm pretty sure I caused this myself because I spent an unhealthy amount of my free time in middle and high school watching tv/on my phone. Now that I have online school, I fear things will only get worse. I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8BA9TJxZLc&t=12s&ab_channel=motivationaldoc) video on youtube of this guy demonstrating exercises you can do everyday to help improve sight. I've been doing them (sometimes skipping a day cause I forget) and I also got a chrome extention that gives you a notification every 20 minutes to remind me to take a break. I've been doing this for around a week or 2 I believe and I haven't seen too much of a difference but it's early. Is this what I should be doing or is this futile? Edit: I got some unfortunate but appreciated responses. Thanks guys! At least I was blessed enough to be born in a world with glasses! "

9264,"19M, eye injury Was at work, got some restroom cleaner (bleach) mist in my eyes. Rinsed for 30 seconds then went back to work. Eyes were fine but then I started overthinking, so I rinsed again. Eyes started getting dry quickly. I called the medical hotline and also poison control and they assured me that it shouldn't be anything. They made me rinse my eyes for 10 minutes. Went to get checked out today and they didn't find any chemical burns. Eyes are still getting dry quickly even after they gave me some moisturizing eye drops. Now, I'm not sure if it's gonna go away soon, feels like there's stuff in my eyes. Would it be possible that the water from my workplace caused this? I thought my eyes were just really dry but now I've noticed it feels grainy- one of the symptoms of a chemical burn but my vision is fine(?) (naturally have very bad eye sight). To follow upon the question, our tap water comes out really white at times. I notice it when I make our lemonades and whatnot. Could it be something in the water causing this? Eyes look fine aside from some very light redness at the edges, but could it be the chlorine or something else? They did a ph test and some glow in the dark thing to my eyes but assured me that there wasn't any injury relating to the bleach. My eyes have never been this dry before so I'm kinda panicking due to overthinking. Incident happened yesterday night (5/16) and I went to the clinic today (5/17). "

My grandfather also complained about this in his later life, being forced to switch from Text to Audio books in his 70s due to the severity of the vision issue Both had been to doctors and not only does no one seem to know what is wrong, they do not believe there Is an issue and will not preform any testing. She has tried drops/tears and claims it doesn't work. I am trying to see if anyone knows what this is, or what it may be called, so that we can at least ask her next Optometrist to test for it or a test we can request be preformed? Thank you!! "
9267,"If you think so. Studies tracking effectiveness for bifocal or PAL specs for myopia control has always shown poor results. I rather offer options with data showing good effectiveness at 50% or higher for my patients. That being said, myopia control is still a growing field. If newer specs designs show same efficacy and is widely available then I will adjust my recommendations. "
9268,"Pretty much 100% of people have myopic regression, just like 100% of people get cataracts. You just have to wait until you're over 40 and your lens starts getting thicker. Also, some nice tiny pupils, while not causing an rx change, can help a lot as you get older as well. I know at least a fair number of 80-ish year olds who don't need their distance nor reading glasses anymore because they're so miotic. Then again, neither of those are related to what causes myopia. But the end result is the same. Many groundbreaking scientific theories were considered unrealistic when they were first proposed. Many of the most brilliant scientists were ridiculed until their theories were proven correct. Then again, there are hundreds of times more theories which turned out to actually be crap, so if you're playing the odds, you're likely not correct. For every Einstein who bets on red 23 and hits it, there are a lot of losers betting on the other numbers. "
9269,"Don't worry about going blind. You're at about the pace I was. -1 every year until age 18, where I hit -10. The progression should stop when you stop growing. -10 is well within correctable vision. However, like others said, you should talk to your optometrist about ways to control the progression. It's not good to be at -10 either. "
9270,"I experienced something very similar. Got glasses in middle school with a pretty wimpy prescription. Got worse throughout high school and college but was nothing too crazy. Ended up with -3.25 in both eyes at age 23. Once I went to law school, my vision got significantly worse every year and I'm now at something like a -6.50 in my better eye. Eyes are healthy even though the retina shows signs of high myopia (which is not uncommon in someone with prescriptions like ours). I did get checked for diabetes given how quickly my vision got worse but I don't have it and am generally in very good shape. Glasses went from making life convenient to being absolutely necessary and I now have to pay more attention to my choice of frames and lenses but my life hasn't really been impacted in any other way. Good luck. "
9271,"26F, near-sighted I wanna start by saying: yes, I should go to the doctor! I totally get that! Unfortunately I can't afford the trip right now. So I just thought I would ask if anyone else has experienced this. For months now, I have been experiencing ""flashes"" or ""sparkles"". Both eyes, majority in the center/near the center of my vision. Most noticeable staring at blank, bright, white surfaces (computer screen, TV screen, white wall, etc.). Sometimes the sparkles are blue! Last night in the dark I turned my eyes and probably the brightest white ""flash"" I have experienced in all these months happened. Kind of scared me a little! With this pandemic, I have been inside a LOT more. I work from the computer, and spend a lot of my down-time in front of screens. Obviously that's bad for your eyes, I get that. I'm stressed a lot, suffer from teeth grinding and clenching + neck pain, which probably doesn't help my eyes (seeing as all that is interconnected!). Of course you look up ""seeing flashes and sparkles"" and get a lot of PVD and retinal detachment suggestions. As this has been months (maybe even a year--pretty sure I was experiencing this at my last optometry checkup in March 2020 where I had a dilated exam and was told my eyes were healthy) and given my age, I'm kind of hoping that's just not the case. Any insight into this? Should I be seriously concerned about it? Could it just be the results of digital eye strain? "

9274,"As far as I have learned in Optometry school Myopia control is more effective in younger children up to around 8-10 yoa. It certainly does still have a slight effect in adulthood but you have to weight pros and cons. I noticed that if you're studying a lot, doing a lot of near work it may make you more myopic (about 0.50 D) but overall your prescription is not ridiculously high. I've seen patients in their early 20s with -7 or -9D. The real issue is with higher myopia the higher your risk for a retinal detachment and have to watch for symptoms such as new onset of flashes or floaters. Other than that I don't know your history specifics so consult with your eye doctor Or get a second opinion. "
9275,"Hello, I was hoping someone here could give me some advice. I am short sighted, with a prescription of -10.5 in each eye. I would love to get eye surgery (for lots of reasons I won't list), but after a consultation with a clinic last year I was told I'm not suitable for the surgery, for having both too strong a prescription and something to do with my eye not being thick enough / the right shape for the procedure. The optometrist did mention that other clinics offer a lens replacement surgery that I may be suitable for and something I should look into, though he didn't go into much detail. Covid happened right after that consultation and in the meantime I've been looking into lens replacement surgeries. I'm feeling a little lost with all the information / different types I've read about online. I was hoping someone here could point me in the right direction or give me their opinion on what my options are, or if there are any options at all. I'm 24.

9281,"Hello, In response to your question, yes, it is possible to obtain a corrected visual acuity of 20/10 from glasses, even in a person with uncorrected visual acuity of 20/200. And yes, it is not that uncommon, because many young people can attain that level of vision with the optimal correction. However, make sure that your glasses are not overcorrecting for your nearsightedness, because that may cause strain on the eyes, especially for reading, which can lead to headaches and eye pain. It is quite difficult to correct vision to such a perfection though, without an overcorrection, since glasses usually come in steps of 0.25 D, and most people's refractions don't exactly fit in to one of these steps. Speaking of LASIK, I personally wouldn't consider it necessary at all, and I remind you on this one particular matter: LASIK can increase the chance of dry eyes for up to 1 year after the operation, or it could induce higher order aberrations for the microscopically irregular cornea it creates which is not correctable, and could totally take you out of the possibility of seeing 20/10 at all. Be proud of yourself and your better than average eye health. Stay safe and be well, Thanks. "

9288,"I know I should talk to my doc about this but my next appointment isn't for a month and they are really difficult to get hold of! So I have congenital toxoplasmosis which effects my left retina. Since the age of 14 it's been flaring up more and more regularly, and the scarring on my retina is slowly growing. It flares up at least once a year at this point. My understanding is that when it flares up it needs to be checked out fairly quickly (usually an A&E trip to the eye hospital) as it needs to be monitored. If it's not monitored and get worse, I think it could damage my eyesight? The scarring isn't too close to my optic nerve but the reactivations tend to head towards it. I'm just curious if it will be an issue to travel in developing countries with this condition. I plan to do a couple of months next year volunteering in a rural area of a developing country.

9290,"The difficulty is that HCQ is associated with decreased occurrence of flare ups and consequent long term systemic damage. You cannot be a controlled study of yourself and therefore you won't know what problems you *did not* get when on the drug. There remain questions about the mechanism of action, but there are literally hundreds of studies over more than 50 years supporting its use when indicated. I do not know where you are from, but if you saw an ophthalmologist in any OECD country, there is no chance they would not be able to advise you on all the implications of HCQ on vision. As a sample of one, I have taken the drug for many years, but the *worst* occurrences related to SJS for me have occurred when I *was not* taking it.

My mom at her previous doc had a bit of minus on her prescription with the actual mirrors in the back of the exam room. Today she went to this new doc here, and her prescription turned out Plano, and the doctor let us in secretly that it's because there are no mirrors so the distance is shorter and is why it seems like her prescription is Plano now, and thus is why he suggests going to an optometrist instead just to get a more accurate prescription.

9298,"You are symptomatic. I would advise getting them. It's not a strong prescription, so CR-39 plastic is okay or if you want a lighter material, consider polycarbonate or Trivex. Also add a blue light blocking tint or anti-reflective coating. Good luck. "
9299,"Hmmm. Diagnosed over 40 years ago, but never felt it had to be celebrated. "
9300," That situation guarantees there will be residual aberrations even when the scleral lens is worn because the tear lens power is not constant. Thats why on a decent lens, there are over 30 different sections and angles that can be refined to counter that effect. For Example, my No7Contacts are cheap, they don't have intermediate zone correction, and I get about 90% vision, with slight, small ghosting around high contrast areas. Compare that to my CAT lenses I'm trialing, where there are near unlimited correction areas, and the residual astigmatism from the corneal imperfections can be COMPLETELY accounted for. You're 100% correct in what you explained, but that corneal imperfection isn't hard to account for assuming you have modern equipment and lenses. "
9301,You should absolutely have antireflection coating on lenses. The only reason not to is because you really can't afford it. Ask the ophthalmologist if he would do surgery using a microscope without antireflection? The optician is correct here. I have a youtube video on antireflection coatings: Anti Glare Glasses Watch Before You Buy: 16 Insider Tips on Anti reflect... https://youtu.be/W9BxV3ah9GU via @YouTube. 
9302,"Why did that turn you off to working there? That is the goal with many elective surgeries. It is not possible to guarantee an outcome. This is not just in eye surgery - this is the same for knee replacements, breast augmentation, eyebrow lifts, rotator cuff repair surgery, etc. If a surgeon is guaranteeing 20/20 vision (or guaranteeing any outcome) then they are a charlatan or frankly misleading patients. The goal of ""satisfied with my outcome"" which we often phrase ""20/happy"" is a much more realistic goal and is the appropriate way to make sure patients have realistic expectations about surgery. It doesn't mean that we as surgeons aren't doing the things necessary to get you to 20/20 if possible and the majority of patients can and do get there - but not everyone. If patients think that they can be *guaranteed* 20/20 vision then they are being misled. "

I've been using some Systane Complete eye drops as well. I am also 17. "
9309,"I had strabismus surgery in both eyes at age 4 (""Recession of medial rectus muscle of eye"" and ""Inferior oblique recession"" according to my medical records) and since then have never achieved stereovision. I've had to wear glasses (my most recent prescription being +4 or so) for as long as I remember. However, thanks to amblyopia (in both eyes) even while wearing glasses my vision is only at about ""80% compared to normal people's vision"" according to my ophthalmologist. Thanks to accommodation I was actually able to do fine without glasses for most of my life but at age 30 I'm starting to need them more and more. The final issue I've been having is cataracts. Since around age 21 I noticed I was a bit sensitive to light and at 25 I was diagnosed with them after spotting them myself while using a microscope. At age 30 they're becoming a real hindrance and my non-dominant right eye (which has the more advanced cataract) can't be used for reading anymore and I find myself dazzled by sunlight even on cloudy days. As my ability to accommodate worsens with age and the cataracts develop the case for surgery becomes stronger and stronger. When the time comes, considering I already don't have stereovision, would this let me use intraocular lenses with a bigger difference in power than is usually recommended without problems? Also, if I get my worse right eye done first and its vision ends up being better than my left eye which I currently read with, how will my brain handle this? According to [research](https://www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860192/) ""if the amblyopic eye has better acuity after surgery than the fellow eye with cataract, then fixation""<U+0090>switch diplopia may result"", which sounds worrying.

9313,"Hi all, When I was quite young, I learned that I had Duane's Syndrome, with my right eye being solely impacted. It's been relatively minor and apart from needing to close the bad eye to read when tired, it hasn't been bothersome. Recently, I've been experiencing some blurred vision in my bad eye. I've only noticed this when using my computer, though it may be happening at other times. I've had a prescription check and new lenses were made, though the issue remains. I have prism in my glasses and I'm not sure if it may be contributing (I sometimes think it may be motivating my bad eye to become reliant on it and weakening the muscles...). What's interesting is that, if I move my lenses around while experiencing blur, I'll be able to find a spot with clear vision in my bad eye (almost always with the left side higher than the right (bad) side). After about a minute, I'll recheck and this new lens position will result in blurred vision again. My guess is that my eye is not being actively focused on the spot and is 'spacing out', since changing my glasses seems to reactivate my focus. But even so, can anything be done? Any thoughts on the matter would be immensely appreciated! In case it's relevant: 30 yrs old, male. "
9314,"Yeah, and I get that. People with high RXes don't need diopter perfect precision to benefit greatly from the lenses. However, it would seem to me it would make far more sense to just buy new single vision stock lenses for 50 cents that would actually be the prescribed prescription. Especially when we consider the cost in time and money to sort all the scratched, used, and pre-cut lenses to a matching patient rx, frame fit, and so on. I mean, we literally just dump all the old lenses when patients get new glasses into a bucket loose, and then once a month they pick up the bucket filled up with lenses. Imagine having to identify and sort all of those out by prescription, if they have transitions, and so on (because they have to match the other lens). Logistically, it just seems far more sound to buy fresh lenses for patients. I understand something is better than nothing, but the state most of these donated lenses are in is rather terrible. Even with a compromise RX, I still think it would be incredibly difficult to find lenses in a prescription that works for a patient and a frame that would accommodate the lenses. (and you still have to hope the glasses fit the patient). "
9315,"I hope you are seeing a corneal specialist. They know the most about KC. Sorry, but I think we all know that looking at the sun is not going to decrease the KC.

9317,"My left eye (non dominant) has a cataract. My right eye shows no signs of a cataract. I'm in my mid-late 20s. I used to use a steroid based asthma inhaler which is the only cause the opthalmologist can think of for the cataract. My left eye is is -3.75 and has some astigmatism. My right eye is -4 and has no astigmatism. I've been to two cataract focused opthalmologists (1st one recommended I get a second opinion since I was so young). Both opthalmologists initially recommended matching my left eye to my right eye. However, I'm wondering if this is a chance to improve my vision. From reading up here and elsewhere, I don't think a multifocal lens is the route I want to take. I mentioned that my job and free time both revolve around computer usage and the doctor suggested correcting to 2 diopters. I don't really understand what that means. Is that the same as targeting -2.0? A lot of people here recommend targeting -1.0. What are the upsides/downsides to each? In what situations would I need glasses? I know I have some follow-up to do but I feel like it's hard to get face time to get my questions answered with covid. "
9318,"Working really takes a lot out of me. Not only am I tired all the time (though new thyroid medication and regular exercise is helping a lot), but I've developed peripheral neuropathy that makes my hands sometimes hurt and go numb. It's happening more and more often, and I'm really starting to worry about it. Not to mention the brain fog making things difficult. I find myself making strange and simple mistakes or suddenly forgetting things. A couple days ago, I forgot the door code to my lab and couldn't get in. The code's been the same since I started working there over a year ago, and I enter it at least twenty times a day. But in that moment, it was just gone.

9320,I hope that if i get the appropriate lenses i won't see ghosting because i am 17yo and i still have a long way to go of studying and am scared as hell. 
9321,"Thank you I really appreciate your input, this comment was very insightful! I do understand that part of the issue is that I am currently switching from contacts to glasses. Your comparisons, especially the rubber band example were helpful though. Right now, I am trying to wear glasses as much as possible because my eyes feel SO MUCH better when I wear glasses for most of the day. This week I started wearing my glasses at work. Because of the distortion, I don't feel comfortable driving with my glasses, so I put my contacts in when I wake up, drive to work, take out my contacts when I get to work, and wear my glasses until it's time to leave. Then I put in my contacts to drive and switch back to glasses when I get home. I know it's not ideal because I'm switching from contacts to glasses and it's hard for my brain to adjust, but I really don't feel safe driving with the fish bowl effect and I figure that this way I at least wear my glasses for the majority of the day and that should at least help my eye hydration right? Additionally, after speaking with a friend who wears glasses and has a slightly lower prescription (in the -6.00 range both eyes) I've noticed that I also have chromatic aberrations with both glasses. When I look at objects I can see blue and red lines around the objects and some bright colors may be distorted. Since I haven't worn glasses in so long and it was happening with both glasses I actually thought this was normal until I spoke to my friend :/ It sounds like with my prescription I will just need to deal with some level of distortion. Right now, if I'm doing things around the house or watching a movie I can distract myself from the distortion and I don't notice it much. But at work it's killer right now. I stare at dual monitors all day and whenever I move from one monitor to the other the edges are curved and if I look down at my keyboard it's very curved. It's very distracting. I'm committed to wearing glasses because I understand that it's going to greatly help my eyes in the long run. I want to see what can be done to limit the distortion as much as possible and you're right, a local optician is my best bet. I'm kinda bummed because I really like the Warby Parker frames and really wanted to make them work, but it seems like they're just not the right fit for me. From my understanding, generally speaking smaller lens size and better lens material means less aberration. My new glasses have 51 mm wide lenses that are rounded at the bottom and I really like the look of these frames on my face. Do you think if I get a frame that has around that same lens width but with better quality lenses I'll see a difference? Or do I just need to come to terms with the fact that if I want to reduce the barrel vision I need to get a frame with smaller lenses AND better quality lenses? Also, I've found an optician near my house with good reviews and plan on going there next week :). "
9322,"I agree, there's no reason being in her 30's would make her less happy with a career choice. I've shadowed multiple optometrists who didn't decide on optometry as a career until their late 20's after having had kids already and they're super happy with the decision they made. "

I do however have worse vision than when i started due to scarring on my cornea from my RGPs. If not for the blur that puts over everything in my right eye I'd be ~20/40 with sclerals.

9332,"1.50 would be just fine for your prescription. For online stores it's not the frame quality that's the issue, it's the lens and especially manufacturing quality. They have terrible quality control. They're cheap because they don't have trained people verifying that they're made correctly. Definitely have an optician you trust double check them after if you're buying online. You also can't really get accurate PD/OC measurements doing it yourself. I've had patients come in with lenses that were switched L and R, off power, off axis, PD/OC off, progressive lenses edged upside-down, etc complaining that they couldn't see with their new prescription. The higher or more complicated the prescription, the more they can get wrong. "

9334,Hi all! I have had a week of hell after finding out from my optometrist that my optic nerves were swollen. I've had the following tests done: - all eye tests: normal except optic nerve - CT: normal - MRI with dye: normal - Bloods: normal - Lumbar puncture: normal with opening pressure 12. I've heard that is quite abnormal to have swollen optic nerves and a normal opening pressure. The neurologist has sent me away saying it is a mystery and I will be coming for another scan of my optic nerve in 3 weeks. Can anyone tell me if it is possible to have swollen optic nerves like I do without a real cause? I'm feeling very lost..

9336,"Recently just got my prescription updated / ordered new glasses. Got computer glasses for the first time. Costco optometrist measured for distance vision (chart + lens swapping on far wall, didn't ask me to look at anything up close), then he wrote in +175 for add section (""in case you ever want to try progressives"" he explained which I said I didn't want), and for the computer glasses prescription he just reduced it by 1 diopter. So my regular prescription shows as: Eye - Sphere - Cylinder - Axis - Prism - Add Right: -525 -100 170 +175 Left: -700 -175 005 +175 And my computer glasses are just: R: -425 -100 170 L: -600 -175 005 I asked him if he needed to measure for a specific distance (I sit about 24-28 inches away from my 27"" monitors) and he said no that is what he always prescribes for computer glasses (-1 diopter). Well, now I'm sitting at my computer and I'm having to sit much closer (~18 inches) to be able to see smaller text clearly. My 17"" laptop screen which is about 30 inches away is pretty blurry with my left eye/basically unreadable. Should I see another optometrist to get a new prescription for computer glasses?

Over the past few weeks my eyes have gotten so sensitive (I assume it's probably from the drops) that I can hardly go outside even with sunglasses on. I was stuck outdoors earlier for a few minutes and the sunlight was absolutely torturous, I tried squinting and closing my eyes as much as I could but it still had an awful effect on me. My eyes have been aching since and I had a bad headache into the night. I rarely worry about my health even with COVID going on, but I feel worried that I may have damaged my eyes earlier today. I'd never experienced them being this sensitive save for when they get dilated at my yearly checkups. Right now I have a follow-up appointment scheduled, it's in a little over a week and I'm gonna try to move it forward when the doc's office opens on Monday.

9343,"Hello everyone, I'm a 35 year old female who has been dealing with peripheral vision loss (mainly OS, not duplicated OU) and inability to get an accurate diagnosis for many years. I've been struggling to figure out what is going on since I was 18. I have no other options left after seeing multiple ophthalmologists, neuroopthamologists, retina specialists, and many other professionals. Currently I measure over 20/200 OS and 20/60 with correction OD, which means that I constantly require glasses that only help minimally. I've been tested for everything from a brain tumor to retinitis pigmentosa with all results being negative - including ERG and genetic testing. No one has been able to provide any answers. I'm currently an optician and working to get my license but per my last results of testing my next driving license renewal will be denied due to decreased vision. My left eye has what appears to be ""tunnel vision""<U+009D> and I can make out basic shapes. However, everything is extremely unfocused and colors do not match to the vision in my left eye. It looks as if the right eye is also beginning to start this process but is not nearly as affected. My last retina specialist noted marked deterioration of my left retina versus my right, but also noted some deterioration there. I just wanted to see if anyone has experienced or heard of anything similar. While I feel like there's mostly likely no solution or remedy, I would like to eventually understand what's happening to me Thanks. "

For anyone willing to respond please be blunt and honest, how bad and fast do macular holes progress. Might as well prepare for vision loss now rather than deal with it later. "
9345,"Thanks. I have been through it all with this. Two ENTs, hearing tests (2x), balance testing at an ENT (normal), Neurologist, GP, one Chiro and now seeing a Chiro that specialized in Functional Neurology. One MRI of the brain and neck indicated the brain as all clear, neck with two bulges (one pressing on the ventral cord). The new Chiro did some VOR (using frenzel goggles) and balance testing and mentioned some down beating nystagmus in my left eye, but all other tests came out normal. We've been doing some eye and vestibular exercises and some upper cervical work (have horrible forward neck posture""<U+00A6>. full on straight and the atlas is definitely crooked). Halfway through our sessions he retested my balance and I basically improved dramatically. This was when I was still utilizing the first pair of prism. I absolutely felt relief from that first pair and then slowly started to slide backwards. This new pair of prisms (still waiting on the Neurolenses) didn't feel right from the start, and it's beyond difficult to focus on anything near. As I wait for the newest pair of glasses, it's very disorienting. Working on the computer is pure torture, but this gal has to pay her bills. It's like my brain is being constantly overworked. I do sometimes close one eye and it seems to provide a little relief. Constant meditation, artificial tears, trying to follow the 20-20-20 rule, flux on my camera. The whole shebang to get me through. Trying to be patient and after speaking with the optometrist regarding my new RX with the neurolenses, he is encouraging me to give it a go as I responded well in the office. He showed me what BO and BI lenses feel like and there definitely was a difference in the strain being put on my eyes. The waiting game is pretty awful, but this seems to be the lesson I've been given. Hopefully the glasses will be in this week. I just noticed that the cylinder changed a bit, and while one thing affects everything else, especially with eyes, I wasn't certain if their could be that drastic a change in a fairly short period of time? Or perhaps I've been over prescribed forever and now am suffering for it? "
9346,"Hey guys, I wanted to share the results of my most recent surgery. I'm 40 and was diagnosed with KC 3 years ago when I went in for a lasik consultation. My dream is to get out of glasses and cross linking was the only path forward. That surgery went well and since then my doctor has said my corneas have actually thickened significantly. I had planned to get PRK, but at my age I'll be needing reading glasses soon, and my goal is to be out of glasses completely. To that end, my doctor recommended laser lens replacement, which is basically cataract surgery. They replaced my lens with an artificial PanOptix lens. With the new lens I'll be able to see near, far, and never get cataracts. I had the surgery on my left eye 2 days ago and it's been amazing. My distance vision seems nearly perfect. My near vision is still blurry but seems to be getting better by the hour. I know this surgery probably isn't an option for many of you, but I wanted to relay my experience. "
9347,"My corneas are slightly thinner than average , I don't recall the exact number but I was to say central 536 ? And it wasn't the air puff test but the other little device with the tiny little thing that feels like it is about to hit hour eyeball. I often flinch and blink a ton when we take this and actually today for the first time I was given a numbing drop to take my pressure because the doctor was having a hard time getting the reading .. pre numbing drop was 19 after the drop when he was able to take the reading more easily it was between 12-14 every time I re did it . So I'm wondering my high of 22 was ever actually 22 or if my eye shutting affected that as well. "
9348,"Power given by opthamologist was sph-1.00, cyl-1.00 and an axis of 170 in each eye. The person who we bought contacts from(a spectacle shop) gave the power sph-1.00, but cyl-0.75 and axis of 180. They said that the cylindrical power has to be reduced by .25 and thus gave -.75. And the axis is off by 10. Are these the contacts i should use? The brand of contacts is 'Bausch and Lomb'. "
9349,My husband wears contacts so I used his saline. Im in my late 20s. No other medical problems or diseases. 
9350,"I had a 50-year-old man come in who wore contacts. He was a happy contact lens wearer, but he had a problem: his wife was taking a trip to Europe for a month and he was staying home. The problem was his wife was the one who had always inserted and removed his contacts every single day for the past 20 years. He wanted to know if he could come into the office every morning and evening and have me put them in and take them out. I said, no, dude, you're getting a Night & Day. "
9351,"Thanks, I definitely believe it's related to stress. It's just crazy that I'm well into my 30s, have had tons of stress and anxiety my whole life, but never experienced this. "
9352,Thanks buddy. According to surgeons no retinal damage but I am 27 years old and think at this point the risk outweighs the reward. I've learnt to live life looking out of one eye and don't think this surgery will improve my quality of life but just exploring all options. 
9353,"Thank you, at least I'm not crazy. You're absolutely right, you would make sure your desk and chair fit is good and monitor would be last. I'm in my 30's, no significant health concerns and would like to keep it that way, I take screen breaks, hydrate well, monitor my vices and the like. The reason this question came about is I'm about to make a modification to my house with mounting brackets, elevation adjustment, pitch/yaw all that jazz and feel like I'm going to mess it up at the finish line if say my eye spasms and burst into flames after 6hrs at 120hz (being a little facetious here). Appreciate your response nonetheless and maybe I've stumbled upon a new market business opportunity, who knows. "
9354,"Hi guys, Female - 33. UK. I have had a teeny tiny lump under the skin of my lower lid for around 4/5 years now (or atleast that's when I found it). Never thought anything of it. Recently (the past week) I have for some reason become fixated on it (health anxiety) and have been massaging it/hot compressing it which has done nothing (obviously after this long) but made my under eye skin very angry. The massages aren't too gentle. The lump hasn't grown but now the skin is inflamed it can give the illusion that it has if that makes sense? Also, for the first time in the years I have actually felt it properly by pulling the skin taut and to the side, the tiny thing is hard, feels like a teeny tiny popcorn kernal and it moves with my skin, it can move quite high up to the water line and to the side etc. I can also move it by pressing on it and it shoots away from my finger - not sure if that's the skin or the lump doing that motion though. ANYWAY, I went for my first adult eye exam October 2020, the optometrist gave me a really good and thorough going over which included looking in and under all eyelids. At the end he just said all was clear, to go back in 2 years and that I needed to have breaks from the computer. He didn't mention my little friend but to be honest nor did I as I had totally forgot I had it. It's just become such a non thing. My question is - would he have noticed it and maybe written it down but not told me? Or should I find a new eye doc? I have recently become concerned about this as I suddenly realised how long I had had it and then I felt it and I'm worried he missed something sinister. Any insight would be great :) If it helps - I had styes as a kid and boils. Had an eye infection 10 years ago. Prone to all things skin issues - had pretty bad acne as a teenager and still have a lot of blackheads now. Thank you so much! "

Note, if you are younger you probably don't need these. I didn't use progressive lenses 'til 35. When I went to sclerals, I went to using readers most of the time, which is why I use half moons, I really liked the smarterspecs, but they don't make them in designs I like at 1.5, so that won't work. The half moons do. :). "

9362,My hyperopia was greater than yours and I needed a reading correction by age 35 on top of the distance Rx. I am now well over 60 and have done just fine with glasses. The shocker was cataracts. I was 20/200 in the left eye before surgery. Post surgery both eyes are 20/20 with glasses for astigmatism. Doing just fine. Eyes keep changing as we age no matter what we stress over. 
9363,"Nope. If I haven't amassed enough wealth by the end of 20 years to have it paid off entirely already or be unable to afford the lump sum payment, then I have bigger problems... I suppose worst case scenario I would take out a low interest business loan or a personal HELOC on the home I owned to refi/pay whatever amount. Keep in mind, the tax rules may continue to change in my favor. Always do whatever you can to keep money in your pocket and pay Uncle Sam as little as legally possible. "
9364,"It's hard to give you a definitive answer as keratoconus develops differently in all of us. I was diagnosed at 17 and was told cross linking and intacs were my best bet of stopping the progression. After doing both procedures on my left eye I developed an infection due to the intacs and had them removed. After recovery, my vision somehow was able to improve to 20/20 with glasses in my left eye. However, I was stupidly too scared to go through the process again in my right eye as I didn't want to risk losing my eye like I almost did with my left one due to the infection. I was able to go 8 years before finding out I needed a transplant in my right eye to see again. Recoveries can be a bitch but we're fortunate enough to live in a time where we can find solutions to help us deal with kc. Intacs and crosslinking cost about 10 grand. My transplant cost 13 grand. Unfortunately, all of it was out of pocket as none of the procedures were covered by my insurance where I live (california). It takes time but you'll learn how to adapt. You got this. "

9367,"The surgery scheduled for next friday is for my worse eye, yes. However, this is the surgery which they are potentially postponing -- the surgeon is consulting another doctor before making a decision on whether to go through with the surgery or not. I havent noticed the condition of my left eye worsening since around March, which is their basis for postponing the surgery i.e. wanting to wait until it starts progressing again. I don't think I should be waiting to see if it'll get any worse than it already is though, or it might get to the point where it affects my overall vision, especially as I move into my early 20s where the condition very well could start progressing again.

He's on Florida Medicaid/StayWell right now, but I'll be getting him on better insurance by the end of February. My dad was an OD, and I've worked in ODs offices 34 of the last 39 years, and neither I nor the OD I'm currently working for have ever heard of anything like this. Do I need to find a Neuro-Opthalmologist immediately, can it wait until he's on the new insurance, or is it nothing to worry about? I'm going to have him seen, just trying to figure out how high a priority it is. "

That's what it looks like. I don't know how I get them. I have these ""attacks"" where I get a speckle of the rainbow spot randomly appear on my vision, it looks like a tiny scratch and it gets worse as time passes- it gets bigger and bigger and it causes blindness for where the rainbow spots are.

9374,It is unlikely you have uncorrected vision of 6/60 or better in either eye. It is not possible to tell your corrected vision off your prescription. Prescription wise it seems to meet the requirement. 
9375," order to get optic nerve damage you would have to have progressive RNFL thinning which is already a sign of the disease. Well, duh. If you're at risk for a cavity, would you tear your healthy tooth out? Or would you wait and see if it actually becomes a cavity? Does not really matter what my RNFL average is Incorrect. Average RNFL is probably the single most important risk factor in early glaucoma. Read any article on glaucoma; your risk is extremely low until to get around 85 or so. OCT assessed my DDLS to be stage 4 in both eyes DDLS stage 4 is very low risk. Healthy individuals very often have stage 4 or 5. Also, OCTs are know to be horrible at determining rim borders; the DDLS and VCDR from an OCT are almost useless and vary widely between scans even when the disc is not changing. There's a reason no glaucoma specialist I know has ever mentioned DDLS score in over 10 years; it's crap. Well, maybe it's useful if it's the actual doctor looking at rim tissue, but no actual doctor uses a DDLS score for that; they use descriptive words. Air puff is crap; DDLS is crap. Don't collect crap. "

I went to a new one for the first time this week and was told I had astigmatism with cyl -1.25 on my right eye, my left eye was fine. I was given toric contacts for it, and regular for my left. My right eye's been blurry ever since I got them, even though I made sure they were on correctly. I asked my doctor about this the day I got them, and was told my eyes would get adjusted, but they haven't. I had to switch back to my regular contacts so I could see properly. I've never had problems seeing/driving and night, or having my regular contacts be blurry. Everything looks just as clear through my right eye as my left eye.

Did multiple mris and tons of other testing to rule out MS and other conditions.

9383,"I think that what is being implied about ""old people eyes is the fact you usually see people over 40 with reading glasses, sitting low on the bridge of their nose while reading. When we age, the lens in our eyes will start to become less flexible, and our close up vision is affected hence the need for close up correction with glasses. With your prescription, the second number reflects the fact you have either an irregularly shaped cornea or the lens itself is shaped irregularly. This will cause blurry vision as the light that enters your eye won't hit the perfect spot at the back of your eye - Your prescription will correct that for crisper vision. "
9384,"i genuinely think that your best bet is going to the Ophtalmologist and doing a full thorough Eye Exam and especially since your 56 Year Old you're more at risk of visual problems happening to you, and don't worry just wash your hands and wear a mask before you go and hope for the best. "

I made sure to check if my contacts are out and they are, I even had my dad and brother check, both of them confirmed they saw nothing. Both of my contacts are in the case as well, as I wear monthlies. My right eye is still the same, its only my left eye that has changed? I read that it could be diabetes but I'm decently active, eat healthy, and am only around 110 lbs so I'm not sure if it could be that... Any advice? Has anyone heard of this before?

9387,"Sorry if flair is incorrect. 23 years old, I was recently diagnosed with keratoconus. My right eye is 6/18 left eye is 6/6 (I have some ghosting in my left eye but not in right eye). Glasses help me slightly but I can very very easily go about my days with no glasses. As my right eye is 6/18 my ophthalmologist recommended Cxl Asap (epi-off), which I will be doing next week. As my left eye is 6/6, he recommended to examine it in 4 months to test whether it will be necessary on that eye. So I have a few questions: 1. What is the success rate of CXL in completely stopping further deterioration? My ophthalmologist said literature shows around 95% but in his own personal experience every patient he's performed on it has worked. 2. Is 4 months too long to wait for my left eye, considering the ghosting? 3. How long will it take to regain my vision? 4. How likely is it for my vision to worsen? If it does worsen, will it only be for a certain period? 5. If I also get CXL in my left eye, how long until I can use it again? As my right eye is so bad, not being able to use my left eye terrifies me. 6. If I get CXL in my left eye, will the ghosting get worse? How likely is this? Sorry if these are ignorant questions I'm just quite worried. "

I'm looking at my prescription and I noticed that the Spherical number for both my right and left eye is the same. This didn't feel right. I've usually needed more power in my left eye. (I have a larger astigmatism in that eye than I do my right.) As I decided to look over the history of my prescriptions, I noticed my *last* prescription wasn't even the same as the prior ones. I'm not talking about the specific numbers. I understand that changes. I'm talking about how much power each eye needs. Prior prescriptions my left eye has had a higher number (I'm far sighted) than my right. Yesterday, I go to get my prescriptions from a new optometrist (other one isn't around anymore) and I noticed that *both* eyes have the same number in the ""Sphere"" portion of the prescription. Is that correct? This doesn't make sense at all. I know my eye sight has gotten worse in the last 2 1/2 - 3 years. I haven't ordered glasses yet and I'm considering getting a second opinion.

I've read statistics all over the place, one said 70% of bilateral congenital cataracts are isolated another said 80% linked to disorders systemically, another said 50/50 in just worried. I'm 25 now with nothing major but I do have pretty significant hypermobility, very early balding not present in either side of the family (19 I shaved my head) and macrocephaly (by just a bit) I know all this stuff happens by itself but I just want an answer about the cataracts if they are linked to anything or not.

I'm not a doctor, so you should explore all options with your medical eye doctor. My untrained medical opinion though is that CXL could be beneficial. Again talk with your doctor about it. The the special lens you mentioned is probably referring to Scleral lenses. The advice I have on that is that they sound a lot more intimidating than they really are.

Is this blurry point something that I will adjust to with more time, or is it a possible defect in the lens, or could it be that something is possibly off with the new prescription below? Thank you.

9401,"I'm 37. Was diagnosed in my early 20s. Managed it with glasses then rgps, then novakone soft lenses. Cross linking wasn't legal in the US so it wasn't recommended. Also in my 30s I was stable... until at 36 I wasn't anymore. Got cross linking now. Every case is different and I would go to your eye doctor more often than you think you should- KC is a one way track so it won't get better on its own. Detecting changes is crucial to managing. "

Yeah, it's not cancer or whatever but chances are it will be with you forever. Unlike my ex wife ðŸ¤£. "
9403,"Mid 20s Male I need some advice. About 2 months ago I noticed a few large dark spots in my vision that move around. Figured they were just floaters. Then I noticed a blurry patch in my left eye. When I look from right to left, I see a blurry spot shoot across my left eye from the left side of the eye to the right. Almost like someone is moving an empty plastic bottle across my eye very quickly. If my eyes are still I don't see it, vision is clear. It only shows up if I move my eyes. It's there and gone. It's super distracting when I am driving, anytime I look into the rear view and back at the road I see it for a split second. Blurry spot moves across my eye. Been to 2 ophthalmologists and an optometrist who have dilated my eyes. They all said I have a floater they can see in my left eye, but everything looks okay. No detachment or tears that they can see. I feel like it's getting worse, what should I do? "
9404,"No. There's nothing good on the horizon. I've read all the recent research and have some experience with regulatory approval. Stem-cell treatments has some twinges of positive indicators, but it's not 5-10 years off: those treatments still need more fundamental research, then productization, then regulatory approval. I'd guess stem-cell-based treatments are 20+ years off for KC given the (relatively) small importance of the KC population. Artificially-grown corneas are being developed, but there's not much in the way of clinical data that indicates they'll be any better than a cornea transplant right now. Even if they are, PK or DALK are major surgeries that would best be avoided, and come with very serious risks of rejection long-term. So I don't see artificial corneas as a true improvement tbh. IVMED, maybe? But tbh we really don't have long-term longitudinal studies about their outcomes and there's no clear path to regulatory approval in the US. I really think the outlook for the next 10 years is pretty dismal to be honest. Maybe the next 20-30 years, but I really don't see any silver bullets on the horizon. There's no ""cure"" that anyone is working on. "

9410,"I really need help. Just over a year ago I was diagnosed with poppers maculopathy. Not sure how widely known that is, but it's a disruption of the central retina caused by inhalation of a legal drug called poppers (sorry if this isn't quite accurate). I found vision slightly blurry and night vision not as good in my right eye. OCT showed slight abnormality, though mainly on the left retina. Despite abstaining from poppers for over a year, I feel like things have gotten worse. The blurriness in my right eye has actually mostly gone, but somehow it never feels like I'm seeing out of both eyes at once. My head always hurts due to this minor but constant double vision, and there's pain when I move between screens and distances. If I start reading my kindle its like I can feel all the muscles around my eyes and forehead readjusting, then if I go for a walk after I'm almost immediately dizzy and nauseous because it feels like things need to readjust, which is one reason I now rarely go outside. I'm wondering if this is also due to digital eye strain since I work from home on a laptop and spend most of the day using MS word. I remember around the time I got the maculopathy diagnosis I went to the cinema and felt ok, then I went just before lockdown and experienced major double vision. I wear contacts ( -5 on right and -5.75 on left) and have had eye exams twice over the last six months to check the prescription, which is apparently accurate. Also developed a reasonably large floater in my right eye over the last year. Saw another doctor and she took a scan and said it was nothing to worry about. This is a far less organized post than I would have liked, but I really don't know what to do. I'm only 33, and I just dont enjoy my life anymore. Please ask any questions if you need more information. "

One of my eyes is near sighted, and the other is far sighted. Its not a problem I ever had before. Recently, Ive noticed my eyesight being much blurry. I dont know if its due to some of the topical medicine I apply for hairloss (finasteride and minoxidil). Im also not sure if it could be allergy related. Does anyone have any thoughts they could share? In addition, I have another question thats a little hard to explain. So my right-eye is my dominant eye. When I close my right eye, and look out only my left, is it normal for my brain to have difficulty processing information? I feel like even though my right eye is closed, my brain still wants to use my right eye. So when my left eye is open, its almost as though I am seeing everything with my left eye *as well as* the eyelid of my right eye. "
9412,"I worked there for four years. Lens quality was always really just so-so. We were really proud of the fact that we carried trivex and offered a ""digitally surfaced progressive lens"" with a ""real crizal anti-reflective coating"" but to this day I don't know what that PAL actually was, and nobody has ever told me what ClearShield UV was, either. We had plenty of patients that were very happy with both of these products that came back to buy them year after year. We had just as many patients that didn't like our products and now probably get their glasses from their eye doctors. Not terrible, also not great. The way they decided to simplify the selection was really stupid, but that's par for the course with people in decision making positions at VWorks. Policies were inconsistently enforced at best and impossible to enforce because of how vague they were at worst. Dress code felt like it changed every two weeks. Last month I could wear any color I wanted as long as it was solid, now I can wear prints but they have to be blue, white, red, and/or black. Last month my hair could only be a natural color, this month it could be hot pink for all anyone cares. They didn't pay me nearly well enough for all of these wardrobe changes. When they closed our finishing lab, they gave our lab tech his papers at the start of the day without letting him finish the jobs in process that he had out. We didn't end up getting anyone to come to our store to finish cutting those glasses for over a month. There had been absolutely no indication that this was something that was going to be happening, and we were given absolutely no support in the face of the angry patients whose glasses took weeks to finish. I was a full-time employee with benefits for four years, starting from the day that I was hired. When we got new leadership, they brought in a staffing model that said my store only needed *two* full-time employees, a GM and a retail supervisor. I was categorized as a part time employee in HR's computer system to make the staffing model work, lost my insurance and vacation time, and was still working easily 50 hours a week. I wasn't the only person in that situation; several people that I knew who refused to turn sign the papers agreeing to being ""switched"" to part time were just let go. Gets a 4/10 from me.

9415,"Hello thru_the_woods! I am still healing from the cataract surgery, and it looks like my vision distance has stabilized right around 20/30 or a bit better, which is a good improvement. Interestingly, the post-op optometrist told me that however well you can best see up until around 11 or 12 years old, that's as good as you will ever get. So, barring an eye/optic nerve/brain visual processing transplant, 20/20 just ain't gonna happen for me.. Oh well.. ;-} I had/have dry eye as well (although not Sjogren's), and used Visine pretty frequently. I was told that's not a great idea, and its really only meant for occasional use. They recommended a similar product ""Refresh Relieva"" that is a better daily use thing (although its bloody expensive). Again, please remember I am not a doctor or a vision prof of any kind.. Just wanted to point out that I found a pretty good solution for my loss of ""atomic level"" vision.

Now, If I need a good look at an eye, I just lean in a bit, and voila my extreme near-sightedness is back. It works really well. Perhaps this will help you or anyone else in our situation.. Hope your eye challenges are going well.. :-) cheers our_sole. "

I can barely read street signs or road signs unless I'm right in front of them. I have quite a high astigmatism, i don't know if that has anything to do with it. I wear glasses and soft toric lenses (RGP lenses wouldn't fit after many attempts) my vision is a bit better with the lenses compared to my glasses I think I've had around 6 opticians tell me I can drive. I've asked them why this doesn't translate and they say that its because the lighting might not be perfect outside. That really doesn't help me, and not being able to drive is really starting to impact my life.

9421,"Hello! I would just like to preface really quick that I don't have KC; but I do have extraordinarily poor vision (-16 in one eye, -13 in the other)... I wore RGP's about 10 years ago and I just don't remember struggling as much as I am right now. Back story is, my eyes are to the point where they just can't really be made strong enough anymore... They need to be indexed at 1.74, and they still get to be as thick as coke bottles, and it's just... My vision with glasses also just feels a bit distorted now, so I know I need to be in contacts, going forward. My eyes get super dry, and I just don't like soft contacts... My optometrist tried me out in RGPs ages ago and I remember adjusting quickly and found them to be fine (I stopped wearing them back then because I'm lazy and glasses are easier to wear and upkeep than contacts are lol)... So I'm back here again, adjusting to RGPs, and it just feels different this time. If I'm looking slightly downwards, they're comfy. But if I have to look forwards, my eyes squint, its like I can't hold them open. That goes double if I want to look at a person and try to make eye contact. I definitely still feel them against my eyelids. For context, it has only been a week since I got this pair. I *have* been to see my optometrist, and he identified a few problems. He made them a little too powerful, so we've confirmed that I'm a bit sensitive there... But they are also sitting slightly too high and to the right a bit? On my cornea (so I constantly see a bit of a blurry halo on the bottom ridge of my vision). We are getting new lenses made... He mentioned that the lab will likely make the lens a bit larger so that halo is covered, and they can tweak the fit so it isn't so far up. Does anyone have a similar experience with fit? Do you anticipate that with the new lenses, and I should have no problems in looking forwards without squinting? Lastly there's a worse light sensitivity than expected, though the optometrist did think that this is due to it being refracted incorrectly due to the ill fit of the lens and suspects it's just bouncing and hitting my eye in a bad way. I'm just hoping that maybe as we tweak the lenses, that these issues will resolve, but right now I'm a bit nervous because it was a fair bit of money and I guess my fear is being out a large chunk that I can't recoup and being left without vision and being out money to invest in a different solution if it's needed.

9424,"My guess is it reduces/eliminates stimulus to the eyes. If your eyes move the blood gets mixed around, which is exactly what you don't want. Think about it like a snow globe. And both eyes need to be covered because they move together. Do you see what looks like a cloud in the upper area of your affected eye? If I sat still, with both eyes covered, then removed the mask without moving my eyes, it looks like an eye brow, or maybe a caterpillar. If I got up for a while it would mix up and look like cloud. Worth noting: The blood settling appears in the upper area of vision, not the bottom area. This is because what a person sees through the lens of their eyes is actually upside down, and the brain flips it right side up for you. Think of it this way: Remember when you were a kid looking at something through a magnifying glass and it looked upside down? The lens in your eye does the same thing,the your brain put it right. Every floater you see is actually in the opposite side of your eye. Just for fun, wash your hands, then close your eyes and with one finger gently touch the upper eyelid of your left eye, by your nose. You'll actually see it in the lower outside corner of the eye - exact opposite of where you are touching. This because the lens isn't involved, but your brain still flips what's happen. Up is down, right is left. Source: 30 year, now retired science teacher. "

9427,"Hi, I have asked reddit before and the advice was to ask for a colonoscopy. I was hoping an ophthamologist could give me some further advice. I was told I was born with retinal pigment in both my eyes. Had it checked at an eye hospital when I was about 12 and they told my mum I was just born with extra pigment. I'm now 28 and I got my eyes tested and one optician said you've got a bit of pigment like dots. Another optician said he could see further over and very far over he could see like dessert cracks of blue and brown pigment. He hadn't seen that before. So I asked for a referal because he said otherwise we will just keep monitoring it. I saw the ophamologist and had a dilated eye exam. My eye health is very good. Before he looked at my eyes he did ask did I have a family history or any bowel problems but this was before he looked. After looking, he said he was not concerned it was linked to anything else. He could see what the optician meant but in his report he states ""bilateral peripheral pigmented lesions with no evidence of any concerning features."" He is reassured giving their longstanding nature and appearances. It is possible they represent congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. He said he will monitor it and take pictures in 9 months time but he's not worried and has seen similar pigment before. I, however, am worried about FAP because it says a sign of that is bilateral peripheral chrpe which I have. My Mum also has some extra pigment but shes not sure if it was both eyes or not. Hers has been checked before also and they said she was born with it. She is 57. Do I need to follow this up and get a colonoscopy or was the pigment in my eyes different to the pigment seen in FAP? Thank you! "

9429,"Hi everyone, so I'm in my late 20s and my eyesight was always bad but had relatively stabilized until my annual eye exam this year - I'm now about a -10 in both eyes with astigmatism, although my doctor wrote me slightly lower glasses and contact lens scripts bc I have a history of ongoing headaches with large prescription jumps (I can't even wear toric lenses). My contacts right now are -8 and they are good for me to work and drive in. I wear -8 glasses because I mainly wear contacts and just wear glasses at home.

I know I can't reverse it and that I'm not a candidate for lasik (although I'm considering PRK and ICL). What other steps can I take to control my high myopia? Will my eyes more or less stabilize by the time I hit 30? Also I've read high myopia means you can't really exercise. Is this true?

9435,"I'm 30 and fit and healthy, however, I have never had an eye exam. While my mom was at the hospital last month I saw an eye doctor complete a vision test in the hallway and afterward I tested myself and seem to have great vision. In regards to sight, I see clearly. However, there are other issues I'm concerned about 3 issues. In one eye there may be a tiny white **pinguecula that** is not really visible to others, while the other eye has had a brown fleck hopefully not one of those sunspots you can get in your eye and just due to trauma. I live in one of the windiest cities in the world and even with sunglasses, small debris, etc often get in my eye. The brown fleck is tiny compared to ones in photos online. However, want to make sure it's benign and isn't cancerous, and doesn't require laser surgery. Also after crying due to a death, I woke up in January and spotted small floaters for the first time. A few months later only one is sometimes noticeable. They aren't as bad now but want to make sure I don't have retinal damage aka detachment. I've booked an appointment with an eye doctor for the first time since I was 12 and I'm so anxious. It took me an hour to go through with booking an appointment as I have a fear of all medical professionals and have anxiety. The test I've booked includes the use of an ultra-wide digital retina scan that can magnify four times a normal retina scan. Any tips? I may write down the 3 conditions I'm concerned about brown fleck, floater, and the white sort of tiny hairpin see-through bump. So I remember to talk about them. I didn't expect to have to get a test till later in life as most of my family members even those in their 80s don't need glasses and have great eyesight. My thinking is for peace of mind, if I go, I'll know where I stand with my eyesight and can work on ensuring that they are as healthy as can be. I'm just so afraid, I think since Covid19, I've been more anxious about getting health checkups and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I did force myself to get a check-up with my dentist and at my GP to be healthy but so scared of this new experience. Never had my eyes tested. Basically, if I go through with this, how do I prepare myself to accept news if it's not good and I have to have procedures done like laser surgery. In other areas of my life, I'm confident but when it comes to health petrified. Especially spending a lot of last year helping loved ones through surgeries.. "
9436,"What are you? 7? How naÃ¯ve can you be? Just think about it. If curing myopia were as simple as throwing money at it until we discovered it then the lucky bastard that discovered it would put a patent on it, bottle it up, and sell it for a heap of money. You think Johnson & Johnson (the same company that created the opioid crisis so they could profit from the sales of opioids) would ignore such a lucrative discovery. You think Martin Shkreli (the drug CEO who price gouged the hell out of a cheaply manufactured life-saving anti-AIDS medication) wouldn't try to sell the cure to myopia for 10 grand? There are cures for tons of conditions and the corporate healthcare world is making a huge profit selling those cures. Why would it ignore a cure for myopia when we know full well a lot of people would sell their home and sacrifice their left kidney for a cure to myopia and presbyopia? Wake up, Junior! This is capitalism 101 over here! *Supply and Demand*!! Obviously there is no cure *or* we haven't figured it out yet. But you can bet your butts whoever discovers the cure will be the next richest person in the world because literally **all** of my patients would buy that cure no matter the cost *if it existed*, and I would sure as hell get rich selling it to them.

9437,"I've got cxl epi off in 12 days on both eyes, one good and one bad. My good eye still gets close to 20/20 in glasses while my bad eye glasses are useless however I got a set of rgps in December which give me 20/20. My question is how many people on here had cxl at a point when glasses no longer worked? I've become paranoid the past week thinking my right eye is a severe case because glasses don't work and having nightmares I'll go into to do cxl and they will tell me my right eye is too progressed and too thin for the procedure. My last, first and only topography was November and they were the results we went off when I decided to do cxl. Not sure on the actual measurements. Is the fact my rgps, which were fitted 6 months ago, still fit me comfortably a good sign there has been no progression and the topography from November is most likely still the same? I'm just worrying and overthinking everything at the moment and came here for reassurance. "
9438,"Thank you for the reply. So what I am saying, without having a focimeter, you are assuming the power on paper which you are doing you calculations with is exactly what is in your spectacles that you have been testing. Good news is that my glasses HAVE been checked on a Focimeter; It's the one reason i actually like (and get downvoted here because of it) EyeBuyDirect; because I've had all my 15+ pairs tested by my optometrist as they've arrived, and all of them are ""perfect"". Thanks for the concern, I won't be stopping my health checks :) So rest easy there. **Does knowing my glasses ARE exactly what's on paper change your thoughts at all?** I was looking at my last 4 years of prescriptions and notice that each time, my right eye gets an extra 1 or 2 degrees of Axis; so that's clearly just the way my cone is traveling (I'm already crosslinked, twice, so there's no stopping it now). To be honest, my optom gave me a LOT more 'wiggle room' than that, but I just prefer to keep it small. ""Add +0.5 to 0.75 if you want some up-close reading glasses"" for example. I just know a lot of people here would balk at the idea of the patient being given such 'power', because they haven't done purely Keratoconus care for 20+ years of their career like my 3 specialists each have; I believe the idea of ""There is no correct prescription"" is very foreign, and relying 90% on patient comfort, *not* visual acuity is hard to grasp. Anyway; I can handle the idea of not putting any sphere into it and just doing the Axis. I was just going through my old pairs of glasses trying on prescriptions; because hey, most of those have +0.25 or +0.5 sph, and identical everything else. Life, eh? "
9439,I don't believe it is available in the US from what I read.. I don't find it surprising because it took 10 yrs after Europe was doing CXL to get approved in the US.

I've performed the epley for many days by my doctor's recommendation to see if it's BPPV but it provides no relief. The constant eye strain, eye fatigue and dryness is what made me wonder if it's BVD since I've never had it nonstop in combination with the symptoms I've mentioned. "
9443,My lash appointment was end of 2018. So long ago. It took maybe 45 mins? Since it was two years ago before covid i remember the doctor being closer than 6ft at times to check on my eyes. He was a lot younger. Maybe in his 30s. 
9444,"What about Fluorine Crown I heard it can have an abbe value of 90. It would probably be a better choice than sapphire since it might weigh less. However, it seems sapphire is the logically best choice as far as to scratch resistance as other materials like moissanite and diamond. Suck in regards to optics. "
9445,"I agree that dryness would be my first thought too. Definitely the haze being more present around lights makes me think of surface disruption, especially considering the history of it happening with extended screen time. They could always use some art tears to see if it had any effect. Other differentials would be CSR since she is high stress, but that would likely have more metamorphopsia and/or a defined central blur rather than general haze.

9446,"25 male, gene testing being done and they came back with a CRYAA mutation known for micropthslmos, (smaller that normal eyes) eye doc measured and sure enough they are just under the norm. I've seen an ophthalmologist every year since I was a kid and they've never mentioned a thing about it, everything is seemingly stable-does this mean I can rest easy and just shrug it off as a weird finding but nothing more, or is this putting me at risk for other issues like retinal detachment or glaucoma etc? I see that listed sometimes on these from doc google but that only seems in the very extreme cases. "
9447,"I had issues with both convergence insufficiency and accommodative dysfunction when I was a kid, and they went away after a few months of vision therapy. Now I'm 23 and in the past year I've started having problems with very frequent double and blurred vision when reading at close/middle distances. It seems exactly like the problems I had as a kid but with more headaches. I don't think there's been an official diagnosis yet, but my optometrist had me do some exercises and try prisms in my lenses, and I have an appointment with her in a few days to see if there's been progress. When I try to research these issues and the different treatment's for them, there isn't a lot of information about adults. I'm mainly finding info about how kids are treated for it. What are the options for if it comes back as an adult? Is it just harder to treat? "
9448,"Currently I have 4 more pairs of 2 week contacts, and I won't have time to go to the eye doctor for another 4 months.

Do you think thats possible? this may sound like an extremely dumb question, but theoretically, if i can correct to 20/20 or 20/25, will i ever be able to see normally with both eyes (like a normal person would and i wouldnt see through just my right mostly) and regain depth perception?

9452,"Hi everyone, I originally didn't plan to post about this online as I wrote most of this for my family doctor/neuro-ophthalmology appointment so please bare with me. Covid-19 has delayed my neuro-ophthalmology appointment to the point where I have been waiting for well over a year now and I'm beyond desperate for any input/answers while I wait. I appreciate everyone who takes the time to read this, If you know of any other places online where I could also get any help with this, let me know as I didn't really know if this is the right place for this, Thanks. 25 Male, 8 years of chronic eye pain/vision decline, visual interruption/floaters, red eyes, headaches and exhaustion. Over the last several months it has hit an all time high, daily headaches that turn into migraines if I don't take Advil which I often have to take several times a week, severe on and off eye pain, constant rapid floater flashes of semi transparent/digital like that are worse with light/outside that turn into more of a visual snow like static in a dim setting inside, and feeling generally unwell, lack of energy. It is beyond me as to how the optometrist and ophthalmologist I've seen has not been able to see that there's something wrong with my eyes with how bad this is and looks. I haven't been able to get any answers over the years. My optometry and ophthalmology appointments have been inconclusive aside from they can see my floaters. MRI of orbital apparently no red flags. Bloodwork fine. Last optometrist appointment was within a couple years (gone every year or so since this started). Ophthalmology and MRI was more than likely over 5 years ago. (cant remember, went twice to ophthalmologist, second time to receive even more tests that I didn't get the first time.) Blood was taken very recently. I'm hesitant to go back to the ophthalmologist until I see the neuro-ophthalmologist even though It's worse now compared to when I previously went, It's still the same thing, and I'm afraid of them telling me nothing, the only other difference would be me having this note to describe it all better, I very well may try to get back in there in the mean time. **-Symptoms-** A constant dry deep eye strain, its a sharp pain/dull achy at the same time and it can sting/burn at times. Hurts to move eyes left/right too fast, restricted movement that can be described as feeling like my eye socket is dried up or is bruised/heavy and feels like my optic nerve behind my eyes is being pulled backwards at times, the eye itself just feels very dry as if I can feel each and every single blood vessel that is inflamed. Pain intensity is on and off, but is always there and sometimes its more manageable than others. These days even a ""better day"" its still bad, (more of an hourly thing at this point) If its really bad, I'm in bed in a dark room with my eyes closed. Redness in side of eyes (believe it or not it has never fully gone away, can see more above/below eyelids) Daily headaches and general top of head pain which I have to take Advil for. Eye drops minimal relief (comes back worse sometimes, sometimes stings) water/cloth on eyes temporary minimal relief. It's both surface and behind eye but typically more behind. It's hard to explain because its a bit of everything at this point, from sharp pain surrounding, straining my eye front to back, behind, to it being a very constant dry slow burn pain that is dull and aching behind, inflamed. My vision is always affected. Visual symptoms have been a slow decline over the years to the point which its at now, which is my whole field of view being 24/7 constant floater flashes/static constantly flashing and fuzzy vision. At first I had a few floaters, and now all I see is debris. Towards my early 20's I started getting a few floaters and over the last few years those few floaters have escalated to ""as much floaters as a 90 year old, Most he's seen for my age"" says optometrist (that was a couple years ago when he said that, way worse now). Not to my surprise, there's hundreds of things flying around/flashing in my vision. I have every kind of floater and visual debris one could imagine (worm like floaters, circles, lines of black/brown/clear, & static), but they are not occasional floaters, they are now constant flashes and movement. ""floater flashes"" I call them, my whole field of view is fireworks of semi transparent to solid digital like half circles racing around and popping off at all times, more noticeable outside, inside its still there but it translates into my vision being blurry/fuzzy static and I cant see very far at all (looks like visual snow inside) (can barely make out a face from a few meters in dim environment). The best way to describe what I see during the day outside is kind of like the static on an old film or rain hitting the pavement, in flashing floater form. At night my vision is VERY bad its just all fuzzy blurry static and I can barely see. Right now while I write this, the text on my phone is being underlined with squiggly lines that are shaking, white background. My next symptom is just rapid vision decline because of all this. I used to have 20/20 as a teenager before this, Now I cant see the 4th line down on an eye test (failed colour test too, seeing dark green as black), all blurry static. Some of it can also be described as when you wake up and are sensitive to light and rub your eyes, my vision is also like that or look at the sun and see black dots, etc. My vision is always affected, 24/7, both eyes. \- I want to note that I'm aware of what some of I'm seeing could be described as ""visual snow""(or if its just an absurd amount of floater debris, or if there's even a difference as visual snow seems to be neurological and I have no idea if floaters can be(not sure if what I describe as floater static is visual snow as it seems to be more like visual snow indoors and at night, and flashes outside) and ""blue field entoptic phenomenon"". The point is the pain I'm also experiencing that its being associated with, and the rapid progression of a massive amount of floaters, flashes, that clearly is only going to get worse. There's so much going on in my vision as of right now its actually starting to become extremely concerning. **-What triggered this and where it began-** **(Or where/when I noticed it)** As unusual as this will sound this is what triggered it/made it worse forever. I want to note that prior to this I've smoked cannabis frequently, by weekly for a year straight. The last few times where not like the others, I noticed my eyes hurting more and more after smoking which is a little odd but nothing major I thought, cannabis makes your eyes red and dry. Then a short time after, I went to try to smoke again and was met with the most pain I've ever been in. It was extreme. The dryest sharpest burning sting/strain pain in my eye sockets I couldn't look left or right or have my eyes open. I hit the couch for hours with my hands over my eyes just waiting for it to end, it had to. long story short, the pain I have now is a dumbed down version of that experience, it never fully went away, and it can spike up. Living with it in a constant 6 or 7 is a death sentence, because its a permanent thing, slowly getting back to the point where it was that one day. Worth noting that I had no visual floaters/intrusion here, or for a couple years after, just pain and red eyes. as you may guess, I haven't smoked cannabis ever since (8 years). Obviously cannabis doesn't cause this kind of experience on its own, the only other variable Is that that day and the recent times up to, I may have smoked via tinfoil/plastic. This is clearly something deeper, wrong with my body, eyes. \-Update to this; apparently my friend used to remember me saying my eyes would hurt after smoking cannabis maybe months prior to this happening but it wasn't as severe or I'd remember it more, but the pain then would have gone away, and same with my eyes being red, implying that whatever has gone wrong here/happened to me was rooted prior to this event, But this sparked it up bad, and its stuck around ever since. **-Side notes (Related or not)-** Lymph nodes around the same time this all started (neck, chin, still have them now.) General illness like symptoms, exhaustion, need tons of sleep, no energy.(I'll sleep for 12+ hours and my body still feels exhausted like having the flu for example when you just cant get up. Clear fatigue beyond mental health. The worse I feel the worse my eyes. the worse my eyes, the worse I feel. Especially my head, even if they are not severe headaches, my head can still hurt. As if I'm suffering from some illness and everything that comes a long with it, this, plus the pain can have me bed/couch ridden, If I'm not sleeping I'm resting and dealing with pain, almost every day. I can't go outside without being reminded how bad the visuals are, to looking at my phone at night while in bed and barely seeing the screen without a plethora of digital like flashing static, with the combination of pain and having no idea what is going on, I mentally can no longer deal with it. Smoked a fair bit of tabacco out of a bong One Time/one Night (Less than a pack of cigarettes in lifetime prior to this)= plethora of PERMANENT lasting floaters. (over 5 years ago) Playing sports/exercise when my body is pushed to limits the floater like flashes can be more vivid, they change from clear/transparent to solid digital like half circles racing around flashing like fireworks escalated for like 15 seconds, also happens sometimes when I sneeze. Maybe similar to when people ""see stars"" I'm not sure. Smoked cannabis out of tinfoil/plastic. Same red lines in side of my eyes for 8 years, literally, sometimes its more flared up then others. (can see more or this when pulling eyelids up/down.) To me, this is one of the more telling symptoms as the red blood vessels in my eyes have literally been inflamed for over 8 years straight! never fully gone away, more pain = more inflamed. Can still notice whatever's going on in my vision inside, outside & with my eyes closed at night (sometimes white flickering when eyes closed), 24/7. Just in different ways. For example at night I cant really see anything as it all turns to fuzzy static. Most of my vision loss is attributed to this appose to anything normal like aging (had 20/20 vision before this and no vision problems prior) not like I've had bad eyes since birth. Multiple blood tests for different stuff, only thing up was my creatinine (118) which I received a kidney ultrasound for and it was fine. Sometimes it feels like there is something in my eye (like an eyelash) but there's nothing in my eye upon inspection, just bloodshot. "
9453,"What is the best way to get the best value for an eye exam? My problem is that it seems like a lot of the ophthalmologists and optometrists want to charge $250-$300 for an eye exam and refraction if you don't have a vision plan when a more sane charge is something like $90. The other problem I have is that I need go to a provider that has an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) and knows how to use it effectively. I have fairly high eye pressure (21) and am about age 60 and OCT is a good way to monitor things and get feedback before vision loss rather than after. OCT is covered by my medical plan... so I need to go with an in network provider... but my medical plan does not cover ""vision only"" so I'm left with these crazy $250 vs. $90 excessive basic vision charges. I could maybe split my visit and go to different people for vision and OCT... but that seems undesirable if the OCT person would even allow that. Are there any really cheap vision discount cards or plans that would address this issue? The challenge I have with those... I don't plan on buying my glasses though the vision provider and plan so I get no value from that part of it. I just want sane exam costs. The other related question... can a good optometrist effectively use OCT as a tool or do I really need to be seeing an ophthalmologist? Even with ophthalmologists... should I be seeing someone that is maybe younger and more into the modern instrumentation... or would most be up to speed. I'm currently seeing a optometrist that I like quite a lot. I'd also be interested in thoughts about exam frequency, and OCT frequency in my situation... eye pressure 21 and age 60. Just trying to get some perspective on all of this. Thoughts? Thanks. Love to hear your thoughts. "
9454,"Yes, I do think there will be a cure. I think it will likely involve both stem cells and gene therapy. Most likely 20 years away. Please support stem cell research. "
9455,"My Ophthalmologist never even mentioned scleral lenses or the possible cross corneal thingy. I was diagnosed at 26 and only found out about both at 29. I feel like they just see this eye disease as a ehhh you're fine it's not like a ""real eye disease lol. "
9456,"How often were you told to use it? Obviously you don't use it often if the drops expired. The reason I ask is that it definitely isn't normal to prescribe that for regular use. The numbing effect only lasts ~10min, so you have to use it throughout the day to keep your eyes numb. The issue is that using proparacaine too frequently damages the cornea, so we generally never release it to patients. "
9457,"Sorry, in all due respect you're dead wrong on this one. The patient exhibits inflammation of the deep ciliary vessels, a sign that is not associated with conjunctivitis. Probably some form of anterior uveitis; and the treatment of the two is completely different. I've got forty years experience, diagnosing, and treating these. Cheers! "
9458,"Every person is different so you won't know until you try each. I'd start with rigid lenses which are less expensive and see if you are 20/happy. If so, then discussion done. If not, then you can try plan B. My keratoconus is quite severe so I wear scleral lenses but only because I see better with them. I find the comfort of both to be the same. "
9459,"I'm trying to work out the best way to correct my vision and would appreciate the thoughts of some experienced optometrists on here. History: congenital cataracts removed at 3 months of age, no IOLs. Left eye very weak, can't read with it due to bad nystagmus. Right eye stronger and does most of the work. Astigmatism worse in right eye. I have a +13 contact lens prescription and I wear multifocals on top of them to correct astigmatism and to help with reading. I'm finding the focal point of the left eye too close and I'd like it to be further away for better distance vision, I can't read with it so it's not helpful being super close. Is it better to change contact lens or glasses prescription? I'm assuming I can't get contact lenses that correct both +13 and astigmatism? Are there any other clever solutions to help correct my vision? "

9462,"Two exams a few months apart is typical before recommending corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL). They want to see if your KC is actively progressing before recommending CXL. KC tends to progress erratically, starting and stopping unpredictably. Sorry you are tired of waiting before you can do something. I get it. I waited 45 years before finding out that KC tends to stop on its own in your 40s. So I worried for 20 of those years for no good reason. When I was diagnosed, there was nothing available to stop the progression of KC and the only contact lenses available were the small corneal lenses that came before RGP lenses. Corneal topography wasn't a thing yet. They didn't have a good way of quantifying what your KC was doing. KC doesn't just destroy your vision, it also takes an emotional toll. "

9466,"A lot of people (myself included until recently) have gone most of their life thinking they had dry/sensitive eyes due to allergies or some other reason. For a lot of people it's actually blepharitis or something similar which is basically bacteria on your eyelids/surrounding area. I'm 31 and never really specifically washed my eye lids/surrounding areas until recently and it makes a huge difference. The hot compress opens up pores (or something, I'm not a dr) and keeps body oils from clogging them which lets your tears run more freely thus providing more moisture to your eye. I hot compress then use we love eyes to gently clean/scrub eye lids and surrounding areas. Helps greatly with burning/itching/dryness. "
9467,"It could be cause of vitreous traction. I'm 19 year old, and high myopia (-8D). "
9468,"If your prescription is minus cyl with a horizontal axis, like 180, 170, 10, etc., you are categorized as with the rule astigmatism. It's called that on account of it being more common to find astigmatism in this orientation. It also generally the least symptomatic ""type"" of astigmatism. If your astigmatism is oriented perpendicular to the above example, i.e. minus cyl with an axis of 90, 80, 100, or the likes, then we call that against the rule astigmatism. It is less common, albeit a bit more common in older patients. It also tends to be a bit more symptomatic. Aside from those two types there is oblique astigmatism. Oblique is neither with or against, the axis is at an oblique angle such as 45, 135, 60, etc. This type is even less common. It also tends to be even more symptomatic. It also tends to be more difficult to correct, especially with contacts. However, you have keratoconus, which falls under the category of irregular astigmatism. Irregular astigmatism is extremely rare and virtually impossible to correct with glasses, though some patients tolerate a lens that's ""as close as you can get"" to correct. The first three are examples of regular astigmatism. To put it simple (and believe you me this could get much more complicated), with regular astigmatism there is a gradual change in curvature between the primary and it's perpendicular meridian in the cornea such that the astigmatism can be neutralized using a simple ophthalmic lens with a spherical base curve and a back curve with a cylindrical component oriented at a certain axis. This sounds complicated but is quite simple compared to the curvature of someone with irregular astigmatism. Because the point by point curvature of a cornea with irregular astigmatism is so... irregular, it is virtually impossible to adequately correct with ophthalmic lenses. The curvature could only be measured with specialized instruments and even if glasses correction were possible hypothetically it would be an extremely custom lens where it's impossible to express the prescription using the sph/cyl/axis format, and that prescription would still only work as intended when the eye is looking straight ahead and the glasses rested on the perfect spot on your nose and didn't move. Individuals with irregular astigmatism are forced to accept glasses prescription at the nearest regular astigmatism equivalent we can muster, or wear gas perm contact lenses where the tear layer between the cornea and the lens conveniently perfectly neutralizes the irregular astigmatism (there is a complex optical reason why it works so miraculously). So the long and short of it is with-the-rule and against-the-rule doesn't apply to keratoconus patients, but based on your prescription if I were forced to place you in one of the two categories your 170 axis eye is ""with"" and your 60 axis eye is neither ""with"" nor ""against"", it's oblique with a lean towards ""against"". (I don't know if I've ever seen a case of unilateral keratoconus. The more likely case is the ""normal"" eye has a less severe form of keratoconus, perhaps one that is so mild it can be ignored, at least for now). "
9469,"Sorry, I'm 29. I've worn glasses or contacts since I was 8, and as far as I remember my eyes have always been different strengths. Less so at first but definitely since age 16 they've stayed the same (no script change). "

My sister got glasses at 6, around the same age as me, but she stopped getting worse at 17 and current wears a -8/-9 prescription at 29. A friend from college was only -2 when she got glasses at 16 but is now -7.5/-8 at 25.

9472,"Question for everybody out there. I'm in my 50s. The rheum who diagnosed me a year ago said, ""If you have to have an autoimmune disease, this is the one to pick. You will be fine. This is very manageable. It is very rare for this to spread outside the saliva and tear glands. The way to treat this is with an anti-inflammatory diet. Stay off pill meds as long as you can, they all have side effects. And stay off the internet. Most people are fine and they don't start blogs."" I've seen a lot of improvement on an anti-inflammatory diet, but sometimes I feel like I was misled. This has ruled my life for coming up on two years now. It does not feel manageable, it feels scary. My nutritionist said, ""There is more to your life than Sjogren's,"" but it really doesn't feel that way. Thoughts? EDIT: Thank you for all the responses! They are very helpful. (The rheum who diagnosed me has moved away. I liked her and I wish she were still here. I had a lot of anxiety over the diagnosis, so I think she may have been trying to reassure me. I will keep all of your advice in mind.). "
9473,"I tried searching this group for keto and didn't see it in the search results at all. Has anyone here tried it as a method to reduce inflammation? I am new to the diagnosis, but not new to the suffering of dry eyes. The last couple weeks I've been reading up and studying about why my evaporative dry eye could exist. A few things for my case stood out. This may not fit for many on this sub but maybe other women are experiencing the same thing. A lot of the research references hormonal imbalance and going through menopause. I'm a 34/F with an IUD. I am overweight.. and have started to show signs of PCOS and androgen imbalance this past year. . About 6 months ago I started getting more acne on my face and jawline. This is also when I got a bad flare up of dry eye. It feels like my health is going to crap in such an annoying way. I have also read that women facing androgen changes tend to get to dry eye. I also noticed the skin on my cheeks and nose have had reoccurring pimples and redness the last 6 months. Salicylic acid doesn't seem to help. That just seems like an external Band-Aid instead of resolving my internal problem. When I was reading about my outbreaks, and reading about rosacea, the content advised that some women actually notice dry eye before their rosacea really takes off. I noticed a lot of overlap with these conditions. They all seem to point to high inflammation. Low-carb diets are often recommended to get rid of inflammation and treat PCOS as well. I've actually done low carb in the past and it is true it completely wipes away your inflammation if you are consistent with it. I just have a hard time keeping up with the diet but at this point if this is what it takes to heal my problems I will try anything. So I am committing to a low carb diet this summer.. I want to give it at least a couple months to see if I get some improvement. I wouldn't mind going to a dermatologist either but between going to the optometrist and getting new glasses and some other medical work that's gone on in my family , I can't even afford another doctor bill right now. I would be curious if anyone here has been trying low carb or keto and if they think it works. "

9476,"Thanks for your reply. They didn't tell me which multi focal lenses they had me try. It was so fast it almost seemed like he didn't want me to use them (maybe he was having a bad day). He had me put in a pair, blink a few times and try to read the eye chart. When that didn't work he had me blink a few more times and try again. We did this for maybe 5-10 minutes, then he put me in a mono vision setup and sent me on my way. I do sit at a computer most of the day. I guess I have my monitors far enough away as I see them fine with my contacts or glasses. Same with my laptop on my lap. Without them, I can't read what's on the monitor. My split between needing glasses to see distance and being able to read clearly without them is very abrupt at about 10-12"". The doc seemed surprised I didn't have a ""middle-ground.""

And if he's one of the patients at risk for whatever it does with chronic usage - be that chronic narrowing of the angles, some vasoconstrictor effect leading directly to optic nerve damage, or some other pharmacologic reason that I don't understand - then he could be in trouble. Maybe it's just my bad luck in having seen a couple of patients that presented this same way with significant undiagnosed glaucoma which has severely affected my opinion on this, but it's too many for me to risk giving someone like this any other advice.

9479,"Hello, I am hoping I can get some answers on here, as I've been to around 7 doctors and they've all given me the ok that I am fine, but my symptoms just get worse and worse. I've seen flashes of light, eye floaters, and dark spots for around 7 years now (since I was 14), and as a 21 year old, it's terrifying. I haven't had any vision loss, but i'm afraid I will get to that point without some treatment or diagnosis given to me. It seems to be getting worse every day now, when all of last year it wasn't changing that much. My symptoms are: Flashes of light, eye floaters (a lot), very sensitive to light, dark spots (they have gotten less frequent over the years), dark lines on the outside of my vision (hard to explain). Some of these symptoms appeared just 2 years ago, when I had these problems for over 7 years. As someone who's been to 7 different eye doctors, 2 being retina specialist, it's hard to just take a ""we can't find anything wrong with your retina"", but things just get worse and more severe. I know I can absolutely live with this condition I have, but I can't tell you I could if it gets 50 times worse than it already is, which is why it's so hard to deal with day-to-day. I am currently 21 years old, and didn't have any accidents, or anything that could cause this. I just randomly saw flashes one day and it got worse from there on out. I try to look up help, but everyone that says they've had this problem, they've had it for only a few days, and they say it goes away. I've had mine for 7 years, and though i'm told it could just ""go away"" and they think it won't get much worse, it's too anxiety inducing. Edit: After doing more research I learned that what I see isn't actually flashes of light, but just tiny squiggly lines that (I thought) were considered flashes of light. The squiggly flashes of light are always in my central vision. "

It's a balm that dissolves everything gently and seems to help add moisture. All of those oily removers and products that require cotton balls or something similar are just too harsh, I find. With my method I still have healthy, if not a little sparse, eyelashes. I also cannot emphasize enough that you need an eye cream along with a good night cream to help reduce irritation. "

My pain was minimal as it was more just uncomfortable for me. My eye got really hazy/foggy for about a week but I went back to work the next day.

We know they myopia continues to progress into the teenage years and tends to slow down in the late teens and early twenties. We know that spending more time outdoors has a protective effect in the onset of myopia, and there is evidence that spending lots of time on near work can be contributing to increasing levels. There are a lot of great therapies available now to help slow the rate of progression such as multifocal soft contact lenses, Misight lenses, atropine eye drops and miyosmart spectacle lens. A lot of whether these would be appropriate for you depend on your age and how quickly you progress. "

I used to be the best sleeper when I was in my early twenties. Then I had a really bad depressive episode and suffered insomnia. Then cleared up a few years and now is back with fibro/ss. Here is some of the things I learned: 1. Difference between painsomnia and insomnia. With pain, muscle spasms and my legs being restless, it takes massage, shower and /or meds/cannabis. If you are waking in the middle of the night is it related to your body pain or discomfort? 2. Sleep hygiene is critical. Being on a schedule, training your body bed=sleep , no blue light ect. Establish a routine. Once you body knows it's 9pm, time for wind-down, your body starts relaxing. 3. Changing your diet to avoid lots of eating and drinking at night. I have been focuising on anti-inflammatory foods and it helps with quality of sleep. Sometimes it can keep/wake you up too. 4. Be careful with relying on muscle relaxers/sleeping pills. You may sleep thru but I had issues like jaw grinding (ripped open my gum that way) and my body becoming used to it. I really only use it when nothing else works. I prefer cannabis because I can use pure CBD which is mind clearing, and/or THC if I need the body high for pain relief muscle calming. I always by from a trusted dispensary and good brands.

Then it was like I was looking through a prism, and gradually those shapes turned grey and were patches of blindness. I couldnt read text, as I could only see half the words through the blind patches. Vision recovered fully in about 10 minutes, then I could see fine for 15 minutes. It happened again for about 15 minutes, recovered again. It went in and out like this for about 3 hours. I got an eye appointment later that day and was diagnosed with a retinal vein occlusion, confirmed by a retinal specialist a few days later. I had full blood work done for hypercoagulate, but everything came back normal except slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, but neither my pcp or eye doctor was concerned. I had a repeat vision loss episode about 10 days later, but it lasted in total only 30 minutes. At this point the eye doctor put me on 325mg aspirin daily. Things were fine for two weeks, but this morning I just had another bout of vision loss, but this time only lasting 5 minutes. I also got my first dose of the moderna covid vaccine yesterday. Thankfully my vision has recovered, but these vision loss episodes are terrifying because I know they can cause permanent damage to vision. Should I be pushing to have more tests done in case there's a more serious problem? My doctor doesn't seem concerned now that blood issues have been ruled out, and she said up front that in many cases when CRVO happens to young people they never find out what caused it. "

I have had 20/20 vision since and have been thrilled with the results, as I was previously a -6.5 in contact prescriptions. Last year I started having some vision issues in my right eye (which was always my weaker eye), especially at night, and figured it was just normal aging, as I knew the vision correction wasn't permanent and I'd still deal with age related vision issues. I went to the eye doctor to see if I needed glasses again. He told me that my vision is still basically 20/20, but there is a scar right over the pupil in my right eye which was causing the problem and there wasn't much to be done. It's gotten worse, so I went back to the doctor last week, and we had the same conversation. He again told me that it's the scar causing the issue. He gave me a very slight prescription and said it may help with night driving issues. I haven't picked the glasses up yet, so I'm not sure how much of a help they'll be. Is there any remedy for this? I don't think any further resurfacing would be possible because of how thin they made the cornea during the PRK (or so I was told). "

9515,"Hi. I'm a 27 year old female and have been having an eye issue since mid/late June. I am seeing an eye doctor this upcoming week, but my anxiety is sky high and I feel like any information is helpful. In June I started a new job requiring me to work from home and use a computer a lot more than I had before. Pretty much use the computer all day. I like to switch off and do some work that doesn't require screen time throughout the day. Randomly my left eye got really red and gross looking. No pain, just pink/red, no sensitivity to light or any goop. Like any other 20-something year old, I called my mom. She said it was probably allergies. Made sense, because I liked to work outside on my patio frequently. Went away after 2-3 days. Wear glasses pretty much every day during work and contacts maybe for like 3-4 hours in the evening. Then early July I noticed a small pinkish spot near my iris, the side closer to my nose. Same eye. Used some eye drops after searching on the internet to find which ones would be best. I don't remember what kind it was though because the box said discard after 30 days, so I did. I didn't use it the whole 30 days. Just off and on when my eye would get red. Noticed it would get red if I would open my windows. Stopped doing that. Noticed it'll be more pinkish in the morning but I can open my eye fine and there's no residue coming out. Fast forward to today: this morning it appeared to be fine. I am watching my friends dog for only today and it was half pink after I took a nap (not with the dog). Anti histamine drop helped with some relief. Doesn't appear to be as pinkish but isn't perfect. I can send pics in a dm. Didn't really wanna post them because it's kinda embarrassing. It's ruining my self-esteem and causing me stress. I'm just really concerned that it could be something I've over looked and I don't know, I'm kind of freaking out. I've had some issues in the past where I've had to take prescription drops. Don't remember what they were because it was during college. Last year when I went for an eye exam (in June) the doc made me wear glasses for 2 weeks and use a prescription drop for inflammation I think....

She's right-handed, and the arthritis is worse there but it affects both of her hands. She said that she has ""trained herself to do the surgeries with her left hand"" primarily. I expressed surprise about this but she assured me it's ok and that her patient are happy with their surgical outcomes. She does multiple surgeries a week. Her hand pain is bad enough that she needs a foot keyboard and mouse to help her type, and she recently spent a weekend taking sedatives all day so she could be asleep as much as possible to escape the pain in her hands. Astonishingly, she isn't seeing a doctor about her condition. She just takes painkillers and gets help with chores and things when she's not at work. It's hard for her to cook, carry groceries, etc. She's not very old, either, only in her early 40s. Arthritis seems to run in her family, and she's been working in a high-volume clinic for years now. This might sound like a very dumb question, but isn't this dangerous? I worry about the patients. I don't feel that I can report this because I may be the only person she has told. She mentioned looking for a non-surgical position, and I hope that happens soon. Is it possible to push through pain like that and still perform a surgery safely? I'm wondering about the ethics and standards for this. Thanks for listening. "
9521,"I am 46 years old, had LASIK in 2003, and developed corneal ectasia. Unfortunately, I suffer allergies and because of that I'm also a compulsive eye rubber. My vision has become a little poorer since 3 years ago. I have visited 3 different doctors, 2 say that I should have cross-linking, one says my vision is poorer because I have a central cataract because steroids drops and cataracts should be removed to improve vision. Who is right or wrong? or should I follow my common sense and get only scleral lenses? "
9522,"Hello, I'm a Web Developer. I use a monitor for at least 9 hours, every single day. I have a 32'' 1440p SAMSUNG G7 Monitor, it's not the cheapest. I have an office chair and I wear a pair of glasses with correcting my visual problems (I'm astigmatic) plus a blue light filter. My monitor has Eye saver mode activated and I use it at 240Hz (maximum response time). I already went to my optometrist and everything is okay with my eyes. The problem is that I have almost always headaches and blurry vision. Everything is ok if I don't use the computer. I'm thinking that maybe the problem is my monitor but I don't know. It's a fricking awesome monitor, one of the best on the market. Anyway, I also use eye drops that make me less strain but still nothing is changing. What is your advice? "
9523,"So I was only diagnosed about 2 weeks ago and have yet to see a specialist. I am working on finding one now. 23F here. I am very confused about how this started. this all started in December when I had severe double vision, not ghosting; actual double vision, out of nowhere. I had to be 2 inches away from my computer at work to read anything and I'd go home afterwards and lay in the dark for 2 hours because it would get so bad after working all day. I was getting over a tear duct infection so when I finally started wearing contacts again, it completely went away while they were in. Now, 4 months later, I can barely tell there is ghosting when I wear my glasses. I only really notice when not wearing any corrective lenses and even then it's faint. I was told this wasn't supposed to get any better. Does anyone have any ideas? Are there cases of this getting better/going away? I told my general eye doctor and he was confused as well. Thanks! "

9529,"I found several papers reviewing evidence on diet and DED, but no mention of sugar. However, these authors [reviewed 15 randomized clinical trials](https://pubmed. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/28371493/) re: omega-3 supplementation and found ""significant differences ...were found in seven of the studies. The objective amelioration was assessed by lacrimal function parameters: Tear break-up time (TBUT) significantly increased in nine studies and Schirmer's test in four studies."" [This literature review](https://pubmed. gov/20031476/) also found significant evidence. I can't tell how many trials were included in [this review](https://pubmed. gov/32235501/), but they conclude: ""...the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in ameliorating DED signs and symptoms is supported by robust scientific evidence."" BUT, [this review](https://www. gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234923/) says, ""The evidence for omega-3 is inconsistent. The best quality RCT \[11 of them\] found omega-3 supplementation does not improve dry eye symptoms or function. Smaller RCTs suggest statistically significant benefits in symptom scores that are not always clinically relevant. At best, omega-3 improves symptoms about 3.9 points more than placebo on an 18-point symptom scale."" ETA: There is research on DED in diabetics, but I don't think that's relevant to a discussion of the effects of sugar on DED for non-diabetics. "
9530,"Hi, I have NTG and I'm in my mid 30s. My doctor won't say how long she thinks I've had it. I also do NOT have high myopia as my prescription is something like 2.25 I think. Nor do I have family history or a single risk factor that would stand out to a doctor. Throughout the duration of my 30s, my pressures have been 14-16 on testing. Lately they have gone up, now 16-18 on average. My baseline OCT was recently and it was highly suspect, then confirmed with Visual Field loss. The OCT allegedly indicates possible early glaucoma damage in one eye with the other is in the yellow but not outside of normal. I just don't understand how a young person can have normal tension, open angle because everything I've read says either juvenile and high pressures in 20s/30s, or as you age, you are susceptible for normal tension. Trying to understand how they go about discovering Normal Tension at my age. If a person under 35 doesnt have high pressures and they have normal visual fields, and the nerve looks normal, how in the world can they find early glaucoma in time? My nerve still looks normal but it's my OCT and visual fields that confirmed my diagnoses. "
9531,hi! i'm 19 years old and i was born with unilateral microphthalmia. we are too poor to get it fixed which is why my eye is deformed now. is it still possible to expand my eye socket as an adult? i'm just tired of all the bullying and the judgmental stares. if not then i would consider wearing an eye patch. 
9532,"My advice would be, if you have no other choice, just do it. Is not as bad as it sounds. Recovery is slow, but, at least in my experience, is not painful. And you can do an (almost) perfectly normal life afterwards. I had 3 transplants: 1) 22 years ago, left eye, full transplant. It went great, I can still see from that eye (with glasses) 2) 12 years ago, right eye, lamelar transplant. It didn't worked. I had 5 other surgeries on top of it trying to fix it, no luck 3) 2 years ago, right eye, full transplant. It worked great. I can see even better than from the left eye (with glasses). "

I have pretty significant thinning in both my eyes in the superior quadrants (in the red) and slightly in the nasal quadrants (in the yellow).. it is completely symmetrical in both eyes and hasn't changed in 4 years with annual scans. Everything else on my OCT and exam is normal including a visual field test. My cup to disc ratio, etc is all good. My eye pressure was slightly high at 18 in both eyes but it was a handheld unit and I was severely anxious during the test.. I'm a 22 year old white female with no family history of glaucoma. I am slightly nearsighted in both eyes. I'm just being told to monitor this but they say they don't know what it is. I'm feeling very worried that I'll develop glaucoma. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? "
9535,"Hey there, dispensing optician here. Definitely go into a shop and talk with an optician. But if you're deadset on ordering online: First, your prescription is pretty mild. Not knowing anything about your lifestyle I'd recommend starting with a polycarbonate or Trivex lens with an anti reflective. If you use computers or mobile devices for long periods of time you might find a blue-light anti reflective beneficial as well. Generally you won't have to worry about your near vision until you're about 40-45, then you'll need correction for that. Lasik definitely can fix most people's refractive errors, but there are trade offs, that's something that you should talk to a doctor about. "
9536,You should be seeing an eye doctor every other year minimum. Once a year possibly if you have already have had issues. As someone who lost a significant amount of vision at 18. I know how fast one can lose vision. It's best to be checked unnecessarily than checked too late. 
9537,"Yeah I mean 1k/mo sounds nuts, mine is $60/mo for my HD plan and my employer contributes 50% towards the annual HSA max here. And yes, 17 seems a tad high IMHO. I dont agree that socialized spending is ideal, but anything is better than the cross-subsidy system in the US, which literally makes it illegal for healthcare providers to compete on price. "
9538,"Hi there Jim, thanks for the insight. Yes the consensus is that I'll be monitoring yearly or bi yearly for any sign of change in my good eye. Let's keep my fingers crossed that my good eye continues to stay good. About the transplant: And even the transplant I might have for my bad eye is it's own bed of thorns I'll have to lie in. Because of the hydrops and scarring most conventional doctors say DALK is out of the question and I'd have to go with PK. And as we know PK doesn't really last your entire life. At 30 I still plan to live for atleast another 50 years and I honestly don't want my transplant to fail in 20 years. And even that's a very optimistic timeline for a PK. I'm holding out for the experimental DALK technique for post hydrops eyes to become more mainstream so that I can get a DALK done. I hope it happens in the next ten years, I really miss having two working eyes. "

9540,"Word there's no way that should have gotten past the prev. doc. Someone with even moderate POAG should have been picked up as being 'abnormal' during chair testing or FDT before even talking about posterior views. C/D is viewable on imaging and if it's not easy to grade then you can always 78. That's just a shit OD. Doubt dilation would have made a difference for that OD. Do you do any other diagnostic testing during your annual? In addition to normal chair testing and aseg we run FDT screening test on every patient & check IOP. Additionally any C/D that is suspicious or unequal C/Ds gets scheduled for further workup w/ DFE, VF24-2 and OCT. I'm definitely not saying it should be your sole tool, but I think it absolutely has it's place in monitoring for change or abnormalities in healthy, asymptomatic patients. "
9541,"I am a 29 year old male. I have always had good vision until I started experiencing these issues. I have been having light sensitivity and have been seeing rainbow halos around lights at night. The light sensitivity is much worse at night than during the day, but it still somewhat affects me during the day. When driving, headlights look brighter than normal and have rays coming off them. I also have what feels like a slight pressure behind my right eye. Not related to eye sight, I have also been having dull headaches in the back of my head and tinnitus. Not sure if that is related or not. I went to an ophthalmologist two days ago and had a full eye exam that included dilation. I was told I have 20/20 vision and that my eyes looked healthy. I was told they see no signs of swelling or inflammation. My eye pressure was normal. My question is, what could be causing my sensitivity to light? Is there anything that the ophthalmologist could have missed? Could this be a neurological issue that an ophthalmologist wouldn't be able to diagnose? "
9542,"My optometrist said I had vitreous degeneration but I'm 18, isn't that a little young? "
9543,"Advances in cataract surgery over the past 50 or so years have been absolutely incredible. Back in the day, you would have to be admitted to the hospital, have an enormous incision made to have the lens pulled out in one or a few pieces, then stay there with sandbags next to your head to keep you from moving for ~a week. Complications rates (e.g. infection, edema, capsule rupture) were relatively high. IOLs didn't exist, so even after surgery you'd wind up needing to wear +10.00 or more correction. In the early days of IOLs, surgeons counted themselves lucky if they were within 1-2 diopters of the target after recovery. With advances in IOL technology, as well as technology and improved formulas to measure and calculate lens powers, in uncomplicated cases it's typical for post-operative refractive error to be 0.25D or less off target. As you are experiencing, some residual myopia in one eye may be beneficial as it gives you some ability to see at near, which would not be possible otherwise with monofocal IOLs. Congratulations on your excellent outcome, and enjoy your vision! "

His pediatric ophthalmologist has suggested next exam to see an optometrist at the university for contacts because sensory wise he will not tolerate glasses on his face. He freaks out if anything touches his head or mouth or hands. He breaks metal frames in minutes and the flexible plastic frames are too easy for him to remove so no one can keep them on him; I have tried, his teachers have tried and no one has been successful. I have severe doubts about using contacts. I'm worried it will start his eye stimming behavior again (toddler and early elementary years he was an eye poker for vision stimming). I'm concerned about placing contacts in his eyes when he is combative. I can't get through a diaper change or colostomy bag change without some screaming and squirming (100% of the time) and sometimes hitting or kicking (50% of the time depending on his day).

9558,"I actually don't think I have Sjogrens but my neurologist thinks I do.... My eyes are somewhat dry (but I take allergy meds daily which can cause dryness and I stare at a screen all day long. I wear daily contacts all day long because I hate my glasses and I've only noticed some more dryness once starting my new allergy medication which works better than what I had been taking the first time I had dry eyes a few years ago), I have schedule an appt with opthalmologist to get his opinion and testing. I have muscle pain in legs only (but we found my pelvis is misaligned and probably causes my leg problems as I'm being treated for it and feeling so much better), I had nerve burning and tingling for a month but I had been taking a lot of b6 and it has lessened like 90 percent since stopping the b6, I still have to get a skin biopsy though. It is scheduled. I have dysautonomia but I also have low dopamine which can be a cause of my dysautonomia, I also don't believe the test was done correctly. My blood pressure is normal low and I was having pre-syncope once I stopped being active due to the pelvic issues. I also had been having no salt in my diet and was dehydrated. My blood pressure spikes when I'm panicking (which happens frequently when I'm upset or stressed) the dysautonomia is not defined but I believe it is orthostatic hypotension and/or maybe vasovagal syncope since seeing injuries makes me dizzy and queasy. I have morning fatigue but I don't sleep well and I have anxiety and possibly undiagnosed autism which causes even more anxiety when I was working, as well as meltdowns and shutdowns where my whole soul felt tired because I was so overwhelmed. I only feel this fatigue when stressed or when I haven't slept well due to insomnia or anxiety. I have stomach and histamine issues which we found is due to bacterial imbalances and too many oxalates, I'm being treated and feel so much better .... So basically I have a bunch of symptoms but have found they can be caused by these other things and they have all improved by treating them with what we've found out... HOWEVER I had an EARLY Sjogrens test done and my salivary protein came back abnormal at around 79..... I refuse to have a lip biopsy out of major fear of it and the fact that it can be false negative.... I still have to do a skin biopsy to rule out small fiber neuropathy and I have to do a shirmers test for my eyes (even though I'm still on the allergy medicine) My question is, does early Sjogrens always mean it's Sjogrens?? My neurologist thinks so but my rheumatologist says it's unreliable and that I need the other tests especially the lip biopsy. Oh and all of my inflammation markers are fine, regular Sjogrens panels are negative... extensive blood work and other testing only found I did have a folate deficiency and I have low dopamine and low estrogen which can all cause a lot of these symptoms. I also felt like my neurologist was putting words in my mouth about my description of the leg pain I was dealing with. And I was upset that he diagnosed me with small fiber without a biopsy so I had to ask for one myself. Seems kind of sketchy. He also was so pushy that it was Sjogrens but then didn't want to treat it at all and instead suggested Zoloft. I was very upset. Thoughts? Im in panic mode and the Facebook group keeps insisting everyone has Sjogrens even if all tests are negative and that sounds insane to me, sorry. I work with a holistic doctor too who has been the ONLY one to help me make progress and we have been finding causes for all of my issues so far, we are just stumped on the Early Sjogrens SP-1 abnormal test result.

9559,Short version: rock to eye from a lawn mower. Had two surgeries to remove lens and repair pupil. Still a scar on cornea. Too deep for laser or scleral lens to help. Is corneal transplant an option? Long version: In June of last year I was at my buddies house and my friend was on a ride on lawnmower. He happened to hit some rocks from the driveway. It shot directly into my eye (40 feet away) Everything out of that eye went black. Rushed to the hospital and then rushed to the surgeon and had surgery the next morning. I damaged my lens and lens capsule and my iris sphincter muscle tore. The surgeons removed my lens and put some stitches in. There was so much damage and swelling they did not insert the IOL as planned. I seen them every week for the summer and they removed my stitches maybe in July. I came back in late august for a second surgery to somehow get an IOL in there and he completed a pupioplasty to bring my pupil to a normal size. I think he did an excellent job with the cosmetic part and just the fact that as bad as my vision is now it's not a glass eye. Nobody can tell by looking at me that I had a serious eye accident. The outstanding issue now is a scar 24 microns deep on my cornea. I have several other specialists for scleral contacts or laser surgery but the scar is too deep to do anything with. nobody has mentioned a corneal transplant yet but I haven't seen my surgeon in a few months. Just wondering if that would be an option for a corneal scar from trauma? Or is that usually saved for corneal diseases that cause scars? 
9560,"I know it is burdensome and confusing but you have to take some time to understand how your health insurance works if you want to get the full benefit of your policy. In my experience, health insurers do try to educate their customers about how their policies work. But it still isn't the easiest thing to understand. Since I don't know anything specific about Univera insurance policies or New York insurance law, these are all just guesses. My guess is that Univera cannot simply tell you to prepay for a procedure and then decide later if they will reimburse you. But you probably have to follow their procedures for requesting a preauthorization pretty closely to get a decision ahead of time. Did your doctor submit a Preauthorization Request Form? If you don't know, you probably call Univera customer service and ask. * [https://provider.univerahealthcare.com/documents/54041/303553/Preauthorization+for+Medical+Necessity+Form. pdf/19fe4e62-db47-3699-f176-8b5092f6016d?t=1534963238004](https://provider.univerahealthcare.com/documents/54041/303553/Preauthorization+for+Medical+Necessity+Form. pdf/19fe4e62-db47-3699-f176-8b5092f6016d?t=1534963238004) If Univera does preauthorize your CXL, I don't think you should have to prepay anything beyond whatever deductible and/or copay that might apply.

9562,"It depends person to person unfortunately. If you are in your 20s, you might get 10 to 15 years, maybe even 20 before you need correction again. Some people feel not having to get glasses and contacts anymore is worth it. Other people feel that maybe it wouldn't be. Your prescription is tricky though. And even calling ahead might give you and answer, like Pacific did, before you commit. I can't tell you what to do exactly. I would advise even talking to your local optometrist before you do consultations. If you really want to make sure. "

Saw an Opthalmologist and he looked and said it's a corneal ulcer, virus similar to what causes fever blisters. He prescribed me Zirgan and I've been dropping it in for about 2 days now. Today it's a little worse in that the burning, redness, itch that only happened at night has moved into the day today. It sucks bad. I called him today and he said to use a re-wetting tear drop with the Zirgan and to let him know tomorrow if that still isn't helping. This has never happened to me before and I haven't been sleeping in my contacts or even wearing them everyday. I'm in my late 30s. If I'm on the Zirgan already for a couple days does anyone know when it should feel better? "

I don't need reading glasses yet, but would need the mildest strength ones if I go up to -11.00D. I'm not thrilled about the idea of getting a cataract. It's scary. But I've been legally blind my whole life, and considered IOLs in the past, contact lenses get pretty tiring. But it's scary eye surgery, with scary risks, and I honestly wish none of this was happening. Do I sell my lens to the Devil for five more years of my life back? Or do I give up driving, sunny days, begin pain management for the constant pain in my PVD eye, so I don't maybe possibly go blind via two surgical stops? Or do I believe the surgeons who tell me it's going to be fine? Are they the Devil? It's all overwhelming. "

9571,"Hello there and thanks in advance for any response! Last week I was finally able to get into the eye doctor as I'd been having some trouble with my vision (things being tinted a bit dark, lots of difficultly seeing at night, and occasional headaches /eye pain). Before I even explained my symptoms the doctor realized something was wrong while looking at the imaging they do at the start of an annual visit. After a chat she diagnosed me with papilledema. The Dr. referred me to a neuro ophthalmologist but they don't have any openings until early November. Just two years ago, my brother-in-law had two brain tumors (he is thankfully fine now) and so this news is obviously freaking me and my partner out. While I wait for this neuro appointment, is there anything I should be doing? Should I see my PCP about getting an MRI or something to immediately rule out a brain tumor? Should I try and see if I can find another Dr. who can see me earlier? Apologizes for being a bit impatient, things went quickly downhill with my BIL and we just know that time can be crucial with brain tumors. For context I'm in my mid-twenties, a 5'7, female, and 150 lbs. I've worn glasses since I was a little kid (currently around +4 on both plus an astigmatism). I exercise less than I should but more than nothing and eat averagely. "
9572,I am 56 and have had KC most of my life and just went from RGP to sclerals and wow. 41 years if hard and RGP lenses and these are so great. Comfort and vision so much better and i am early in fitting process. The acuteness of my vision is so much better. 
9573,"I'm struggling to be diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder or anything for that matter. I am in agonizing pain around my neck and behind my head anytime I eat. I've tried to begin rearranging my diet to be less inflammatory but it doesn't seem to matter what I'm putting in my body. Furthermore,I'm getting insane pain in my ribs on my sides under my armpit and in my shoulders in random bursts. Dry eye is very persistent, my throat and nose are beyond dry and my mouth is retaining some moisture (except for at nighttime and in the morning) but I often have pain in my tongue. Joint and muscle aches change and go all over, I'm extremely fatigued and experiencing confusion as weird lapses of ""out loud dyslexia""<U+009D>- its the only way I can describe it . I have tested negatively for Sjogrens antibodies and ANA. I have been seeing doctors every week over the course of a month and just saw a rheumatologist Monday. They deny anything is wrong because of my bloodwork. They say some of my problems are caused by a b12 deficiency and the rest are unexplainable. Like how degrading!! Honestly, the pain and irritation I feel all around my body is taking away my quality of living. I can't sleep, eat or feel like I can take on my day. How do you maintain feeling valid or furthermore, how do you finally assert yourself enough to express your pain isn't a cry for medicine but simply an answer? I have been tested for the flu, TSH, Lyme, anemia, all of which have came back negative. I posted here a few weeks ago explaining my symptoms extremely in depth. A new symptom, being the neck pain after eating is so unbearable I can't take it. It stays for hours at a time. I presume a lot of this has to due with my age, I'm an 18 year old woman and my body isn't expressing the way I'm feeling the way I need it to, I think. I'm seeing a completely new doctor in a new facility Friday. I'm scared to have the same problem and be completely re-dismissed. Feel free to ask any questions, looking for recommendations or even hearing similar stories of how you've overcame this issue. Im very much by myself in regards to family and my partner is getting very worked up listening to me be so upset and discomforted all day. It's making me guilty. Anything helps. "
9574,Were you diagnosed in your 30s? I was just recently diagnosed with KC at 27 and with correction I am able to see 20/20 with right eye and 20/30 with left. I am not very interested in wearing sclerals and would like to stick with glasses. My doctor report says that I have mild KC in right and moderate in left. Since I was just recently diagnosed I am still wondering and doing my research if CXL is absolutely required for me. I might get a second option from another doctor. Thanks for your help. 
9575,my eye doctor mentioned CXL but also said that my age being 31 that they probably wouldnt consider me a candidate for it? something to do with usually KC is fully progressed by the time u hit ur 30s? i noticed the blurring in my right eye vision about 2 years ago. and i didnt start seeing double images/light streaking until about 7-11 months ago. 
9576,... I can see clearly with my glasses on but I'm worried about the cataract getting worse or something. I'm only 26 and this is very upsetting. I'm not sure what to do. If you're happy with your vision then there's nothing to do. Dont worry. 
9577,"Consider COBRA coverage for a short while after you leave. But he doctor's description doesn't sound like anything requiring surgery or expensive treatments. Possibly glaucoma, but glaucoma is a 20-year disease and nothing changes quickly. "
9578,I'll keep this short. I developed severe dry eye after numerous medications for acne and also trying contact lenses and working under supermarket lights all at the age of about 17. I still suffer today at 39 years old. I have digestive issues and anxiety as a result. I get lots off discharge in the corners of the eyes and inflamed eyelids also. To help others I'll list the things that help me. Blink more often consciously. I probably blink 60 times a minute. Look at getting tear ducts plugged. I have upper and lower done. Use a steam room regularly. Followed by cold shower. A hot shower works also. This helps unblock the oil lipids along the eye lids. Reduce sugar intake to absolute minimum ( fruit not included) Eat a clean diet when possible. Limit alcohol and any caffeine stimulants etc. Exercise regularly. Particularly outside. I find running or biking outside can help clear my sinuses if done regularly. Try and get as much sleep as possible. Wash your pillow covers regularly. Wash your eyes gently with warm water regularly to clear the discharge. Work towards a stress free life. I.e work flexibility and a job you enjoy. Get on top of money issues etc. If I do all of the above my eyes are drastically better. However it's easier said than done particularly a clean diet and regular exercise. Hope this helps Some one.

When I was about 15 I noticed that I couldn't see things in the distance quite well. Of course, I turned out to be nearsighted. The diopter increased from -0.5 (beginning of highschool) to -1.75 (the end of first year of college). I have finished my second year in college and now the diopter is -2.25. Of course, med school being med school, I study a lot and when I rest I usually spend time on my phone or laptop. I was pretty chill because I thought I'll just get laser diopter removal, but my ophthalmologist told me to never do that because I have only one functional eye. After learning that I have trouble sleeping and am in general just really worried because I already have a pretty bad eyesight and I don't know how to stop my diopter from growing. My doctor told me that it will stop growing probably after college but I have 4 more years to go.

Interesting the continued notes on the poly though. Doctor 2 insisted on not using poly and I have ordered CR-39 lenses there. I'm not sure what Doctor 1 re-ordered with my latest prescription yet, but I would guess Poly again based on the notes from my appt yesterday. I should have the CR-39 lenses this week to try. Before I went to Eyezen Poly, I never had remakes done. The Trizen lenses were great. I had noted that a few times and they would just change the Eyezen power and found PD numbers were off by 5-6mm in another set which they blamed for some items too. I will definitely be more persistent on paying for the better optic material though. Yes, I'm not looking forward to progressives at all when that day comes. :). "

9585,"Hello reddit friends! I am a healthy 29 year old. A month ago I had a spontaneous retinal detachment, macula-on. I had a scleral buckle placed in the eye. Previously, my glasses prescription was: -.5.50 OS, -2.50 OD. However, to my dismay, I learned today that my Rx in the eye with the buckle is now -9.50. The optometrist says my options are contact lenses or LASIK. I have never been able to tolerate contact lenses in the past because I work with computers for a living and my eyes get painfully dry and blurred while wearing contacts. This is why I have always worn glasses. I am scared to get LASIK because my right eye is fine. (I'm so grateful for that!) Some questions I have (and I would be so grateful for any advice or answers etc) are: 1. How do others avoid computer vision syndrome and/or dry eye while wearing glasses? 2. Why can contact lenses fix anisometropia but not glasses? 3. Should I get LASIK in the eye with the buckle and leave the other eye alone. Is that too dangerous? 4. Will patching the ""bad"" eye at work cause a lazy eye? 5. Is there a special diet or any ""alternative"" approach I can take to help with any of my visual problems? 6. Support groups for sudden vision loss are not operating in my area due to the pandemic. Are there any online support groups or resources? It has been very traumatizing to face sudden vision loss and I am experiencing a lot of sadness and grief over it. 7. If you've been through retinal detachment or scleral buckle surgery or dealt with high anisometropia do you have any advice? Thank you all so much. "

9587,"Hi- I've recently had CXL and intacts into both of my eyes (developed noticable keratoconus in early 20s and it's progressed rapidly in my right eye). But anyways I've been getting fitted for scleral lenses but I just have the hardest time putting them in and need assistance. I've tried a ton of different methods and I know it'll get better the longer I work with them. Did anyone who uses scleral lenses use a stand or other helping device? I saw a video and have seen on Amazon a stand for $300-$400 but that seems a bit wild to pay for a tool. But I'm not opposed to paying that if it's the best option available. I'd appreciate any advise to new scleral lens users also, this is totally foreign to me. "
9588,A bit of backstory first. I transitioned from RGP lenses to scleral lenses which are much more comfortable. I have glasses too in a pinch but they really only correct my left eye to about 90% and do nothing for my right eye. I was diagnosed with Keratoconus about 6 years ago. I recently asked my Eye Doctor if getting CXL was an option to help my vision but he said I was too old. I'm a 40 y/o male if that matters. Do I have any other options here?

9594,"Yes because, even though I am only 18 and have had sjorgens problems since maybe freshman year, I already have damage on my left eye from roughness thats very visible with my front camera, ongoing blepharitis and my eye doc said both eyes have severe lacrimal dysfunction. I also went into kidney failure this year because I didn't know sjorgens could cause renal tubular dysfunction- I had extremely alkaline urine, blood/bacteria in urine, and for the past month have had severe kidney pain, itchiness and the most extreme dryness ever, it got to the point where I haven't been able to breathe, when I cough just a wheeze comes out and inhalers don't help. Now that I am on the right antibiotic (immune to most from UTIs as a child), I can breathe- before it was like my lungs were heavy almost, it wasn't really my throat that was the issue. Mine was untreated for a while and I probably have damage. The few months it has even been to where when I eat something I get intense pain and dryness to where it hurts to breathe, and I always fall asleep. Because my kidneys couldn't filter out the waste. Sjorgens is such a pervasive thing. Because your body needs acetylcholine and lipids and moisture for absolutely everything. If it goes super untreated for years your risk of lymphoma will go through the roof. But don't get scared by that. Find a really good rheumatologist, I go to one that has 5 stars everywhere online and has won awards, this makes for a doctor that listens to you and doesn't tell you to just go outside and thats there nothing wrong with you. Which I was told more than once. For eyes, you can get punctal plugs. You can be prescribed cholinergic medicines. Or immunosuppresants. Sometimes people can downplay sjorgens and just treat it as something that makes you dry.

9598,"Hello, I had intralase sbk 2.5 months ago. After 2 weeks I noticed a tiny horizontal smudge in the center of my vision in both eyes, almost like light is refracting differently off of a tiny line in the center of each eye. 2 months ago, when this started, I went to an optometrist nearby and she said everything she could see looked good, including that I did have some dryness but very minor that shouldn't cause visual changes. And she didn't feel that the lasik would cause what I was describing. She wanted to send me to a retina specialist since it was a blurry problem with my central vision. As I mentioned, I wouldn't describe it as blurry, more like a tiny horizontal smudge on a pair of glasses, in both eyes that hasn't changed at all since it started March 19. But I was very happy to be referred to a retina specialist just in case. After the optometrist I went to see the surgeon who did my lasik procedure and he didn't see anything he was concerned about. He did see a little wrinkle in the left eye but it wouldn't be something I could see according to him. He said to follow up in a week at the clinic. I went to the follow up with an optometrist at the surgery clinic, didn't see any problems. Said *maybe* it's from dry eye and to use only preservative free eye drops every 1-2 hours for 2 months (the week before I asked the surgeon if I should be using only preservative free eye drops and he said it didn't matter). Now I'm 6 weeks with heavy use of preservative free drops, no change at all. A couple of days I've been out hiking and didn't use the drops for hours, when I got back to the car I checked closely for change in the smudges by closing one eye at a time and it was no worse at all. I wasn't dying for the drops either, my eyes didn't feel dry or irritated at all. Yesterday I went to the retina specialist & was told that my retinas are ""very healthy.""<U+009D> He said I *could* have dry eye and he will send a note back to the optometrist to treat me for dry eye. I have seen blurry vision as a symptom of dry eye, but my vision isn't blurry. And the smudges don't change at all depending on frequency of use drops, screen time, etc which led the original optometrist away from dry eye as the cause. No doctor has outright said I have dry eye, just some dryness and lots of ""maybe.""<U+009D> Could the smudges really be caused by dry eye? Even if for 6 weeks there has been no improvement with LOTS of drops? What else may cause it? I stayed away from looking online until the past few days because that can be a useless time suck and I have access to doctors and in person appointments thankfully. But after several visits with no definitive answer I started looking. There was only one instance I found (so far) of specifically a smudge in center of vision (not blurring or vision loss) and turns out she had vitreoretinal lymphoma. I'm not freaked out and thinking I have that, but I'm wondering if there's an unusual answer that doctors aren't looking for... they've kinda been dismissing my claim and saying all looks good. I have the next follow up with the surgery clinic in 1 week. What should I be asking them? I feel like they are going to keep telling me it's dry eyes and to do the same thing which has had no effect... Also the ophthalmologist (retina specialist) yesterday said my cornea was pitted. I should have asked in the moment (I'm pretty terrible at asking questions at medical appointments sigh), is this a common term? Would pitting cause the smudge I see? I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just wondering if it sounds like I should continue thinking it's dry eye and amp up the treatment. And mainly hoping for advice on what to ask at my next appointment to figure this out and get proper treatment. Each time I keep asking ""so you don't see anything that would cause the smudge""<U+009D> and I'm told ""no.""<U+009D> But something is causing it so I guess I need better questions and I have no idea where to start. Maybe I shouldn't have written so much and I'm sure I'm asking too much, but any thoughts will be muuuuuch appreciated. Thanks for reading :). "

Anyway, my reflux is usually mildly aggravating at night and I need the meds to sleep. Nothing has changed so far and the ability to have saliva bathe my mouth is heaven. I'd gone off pilocarpine years ago due to vanity and drooling while I slept. Yeah, well I'm older and wiser now and a little drool is so worth it!

This got me thinking about skincare and cosmetics. I'm in my 30s and have begun to worry about my skin and ""aging"", so am trying to wear sunscreen more. I've been using [this Supergoop eye cream](https://supergoop.com/products/bright-eyed-100-mineral-eye-cream-spf-40) with SPF around my eyes when I remember to. At night I've been using [this RoC eye cream](https://www.rocskincare.com/products/retinol-correxion-eye-cream-new-look). I have sensitive skin that's oily and acne-prone, so also use OTC Differin on my face most nights. Over the past year, I began experiencing MGD and blepharitis worse than before, and my eye MD switched me from restasis to cequa ~1 month ago. She also asked at that time if I had been diagnosed with rosacea or eczema, which I haven't, but I said it wouldn't surprise me at all. We also talked about possible IPL treatments if the cequa doesn't help enough. I began using the two eye creams in the fall, so I don't think they're at the root of the worsened MGD/blepharitis, but I don't want to contribute to my eye issues if I can help it.

9609,"When I was about 10 or so, I had to do a tonometry because my pupils were a bit larger than average, and so doctors wanted to check my eyes for glaucoma. The test itself required me to take numbing drops, hold my head still on a machine, and wait for a blue ring of light to gradually come closer and touch my cornea. Problem was, I felt it when that ring made contact (no pain, just a touch sensation), and I reflexively blinked and flinched backwards. The attending doctor quite sternly told me not to do that, because it could damage my retina. That knowledge (and being reprimanded in general) made me further terrified of the test, so when I had to take it again for the other eye, I tried my very hardest not to flinch backwards. But, of course, my reflexes and instincts didn't obey me, and I jerked my head back again. I got scolded for a second time, and I felt awful, because even if the reprimand was light (and valid), it was ultimately over something that I didn't feel like I had any control over.

Regardless, this memory of fear has stuck itself in my head, and even if it wasn't affecting my anxiety as much nowadays, I still think I'd flinch and/or hold my breath again if I was given the test. The ""puff of air"" test, on the other hand, has never significantly bothered me when I've taken it, and it's actually been a relief, because I know it's not the *other* test. All of this to say: I'm scared that I'll ""have"" to do another contact tonometry at a new doctor I'll be seeing (even though I'm not a minor anymore), and I'm just posting this to vent and possibly get some basic reassurance that there are other ways to measure eye pressure, such as the ""puff of air"" test, if possible. Thanks for reading! "
9610,"Hi, So Acuvue discontinued the biweekly lenses I normally buy for like 60 dollars. Now its like 130 because they only do 12 lenses instead of 6 in a pack. Does anyone know if switching to another brand like Splash for instance with a BC of 8.6 will make that much of a difference? On my prescription I am a 8.4 BC but it doesn't give me the option to choose my BC with the other contact lens options. Thanks! "

9612,"I'm currently just an Ophthalmic Assistant (float between all clinics), but from my own personal experience it's an extremely busy but rewarding job. My day involves doing full work ups (no refraction), any additional testing needed, lensometry, dilation if needed and finding time to do an I&R in between patients. Personally, I LOVE my job and based on which doctor I work with for the day, they're very open to asking for input and actively including me in the process which is fantastic for understanding the depth of every decision being made. I would say, the hardest aspect of the job is finding time to do everything that's needed in between patients (usually seeing one every 20 minutes). I'm currently also uncertified and I've only been teching for about ~6 months (90% of my prior eyecare experience was as a receptionist) so it's definitely doable! Everyday is a new experience. "
9613,"It's different for everyone. There was a study suggesting that pain is strongly correlated with age. Young people that get it experience pain, but older (30s being old for this condition) people don't experience much. I'm in my 30s and I only had some pain immediately after waking up the day after. Put my eye drops in and took some painkillers and was completely fine 15 minutes later. I had a little more discomfort after they took the contact lens bandage off several days later, not really pain just discomfort. If you haven't felt any, you probably won't feel any at all. Out of curiosity though, do you know if they even did an epi-off procedure? Or epi-on? "
9614," I should in theory notice my near vision deteriorating. Almost everybody notices it after 40.

9616,I'm 20 and have had myopia since I was 16. Every year my eyesight becomes worse (I'm on -2.75 in both eyes) and I'm left with a chunky bill for diagnosis and new frames+lenses. Is there any anatomy or physiology of the eye which can suggest the progression of myopia will stop / be very slow? Akin to a growth plate in a bone which fuse at the end of growth? I'm really annoyed now at paying 200-300 pounds per year on this. 
9617,"how much does hard lenses help? Is it supposed to restore my vision to 20/20, or is that to optimistic? Every case and experience is bound to vary enough that you mightn't want to set expectations before seeing first-hand what correction each type of lens can provide for you. For context; at diagnosis my left eye had deteriorated to the point where I'd unwittingly started to ignore all input from it. I was unaware that I automatically defaulted to using one eye at a time, so it was only when I was referred to an Optometrist that I was made to use the left and immediately became conscious of the extent of the problem. The right eye was affected as well, though it was a milder case. In my first appointment with that Optometrist I tried small RGP lenses in both eyes, and we found that despite the severity of the condition in my left eye, as soon as I had the correct lens in it was able to give me a greater degree of sharpness and clarity than I could achieve with the ""stronger"" lensed right. The primary obstacle to use at that time was my aversion to putting anything in my eyes, and just the general discomfort of wear. Even so, the effect on vision was pretty stunning with my worse eye, and I became more comfortable with use over time. Lenses corrected my right eye as well, though there was nothing like the same sharpness. Was able to use small lenses in the left for four or five years before they stopped fitting. I've never been able to achieve a fit [or anything approaching comfort] with the larger scleral lenses. Most folk report much more positive experiences and results with scleral lenses, recommending them over smaller RGPs, so again it will come down to trying all options that are available to you to find what suits. [Still using a small RGP in my right eye after sixteen years.]. "
9618,So do most people with occasional 20-22pressures not get glaucoma?

9620,But then we get back to the fact my pressures are likely actually 15-19 on average (most of my appointments are early morning by the way which I've heard affects it) if we assume a slight decrease in IOP for thickness. Yes I know there's no perfect equation but we can assume a tiny bit at least. Even that makes a big difference. Are you implying that most people are actually 10-12 IOP or something? Genuinely curious what most are for young adults. 
9621,"AMD stands for Age Related Macular Degeneration, being 26 years old it is incorrect to call this disease AMD. As you mentioned it ""AMD"" affects only central vision, correct. Having a scotoma in the periphery means that your macula isn't touched (if you do have your fundus photo, feel free to send it to me I'll have a look, if you have a report and would be willing to share it in private it's better). As for the differential diagnostic of toxoplasmosis, it sounds more likely. Infection to the disease isn't only through cat feces, it can come from undercooked meat, mother to baby transmission during pregnancy. How ever if it so happens to be a Macular Degeneration, according to your age it would be a Juvenile Macular Degeneration (such as Stargardt's disease) If you have a photo of your fundus do send it to me, I'll take a look. It would be good to have a 3rd opinion, to reassure you. The most important thing is to have trust in your doctor's diagnostics if that needs to come from a 3rd opinion so be it. :) - optometrist. "
9622,"**Disclaimer:** * I am no healthcare professional and just genuinely curious about this topic! I am not trying to start a battle between ODs and MDs and hope this discussion will be peaceful. * Please redirect me to another reddit if this question is more appropriate there. **For non-Americans or anyone interested in learning the years of schooling:** This is from a perspective of the American education system, but I would LOVE to learn more about other countries' processes of optometrist (OD) to ophthalmologist! In America, you have to do medical school (4y) + ophthalmology residency (4y) to become an ophthalmologist; it totals to 8 years. Currently however, there is no shortcut program from OD to ophthalmology. That means if an OD (4y) later wants to become an ophthalmologist, they have to go enter medical school (4y) + residency (4y); that totals to 12 years. On the other hand, dentists (DDS) (4y) can go into oral surgery (OMFS) with a 4-6y shortcut; that totals to 8-10 years. **Actual Question:** I heard some OD and DDS students take the same amount of systems and pharm class (some are even in the same classroom together). So if DDS can go to OMFS via a 4 year (w/out MD) or 6 year (w/ MD) path to OMFS, why cant ODs do the same to become an ophthalmologist? If OMFS is a dental specialty, has the education system consider ophthalmology as a optometry specialty? I ask bc I feel that a shortcut path may be beneficial to those optometrist that later find interest for ophthalmology. **TLDR:** Should there be an optometrist to ophthalmologist program like how there is a dentist to oral surgery program?

9623,"You won't make the good eye worse. You might talk with your doctor because wearing just the +2.50 creates an imbalance and I would probably adjust the bad eye to +2.00 or less if you aren't wearing the +1.00, so they'd be off by a more similar amount. Also you'd probably see fine with +0.50 in the good eye but if you're under 30 it's hardly worth doing. "

9625,"What you may not understand is that you may have developed keratoconus even if you never had LASIK - i.e., LASIK may not have been the cause of your ectasia. Keratoconus is a natural occurrence for some people. You may now benefit from corneal crosslinking, which can stabilize your cornea. This can often be followed by PRK to alleviate any residual refractive errors and irregularities. Once again, sorry you are living with a problem with your vision, but that's not the outcome for 99+% of people who benefit from clear, natural vision after LASIK. I will not go away, just because you are unhappy in your life. For many people like me, it's the best thing I've ever done for myself. "

9627,"Zeiss lenses are super nice. I cannot deny that. Though they honestly may not be available wherever you go. To be flat honest with your script and style of frame choice you would be best with plastic CR-39 lenses. Brand doesn't matter. Plastic is the best for your visual acuity. You could pay more and get a high index lens of again, whichever branding, but with your Rx, you don't honestly need to. If you really want Zeiss lenses I would do that by purchasing the frames separate and then contacting Zeiss directly and see where they recommend sending your frames to. They have a web interface for all their users. Transitions ( brand ) lenses. What colour is your personal choice however the gray tone does get the darkest. As others said, they don't darken well in the car. An Anti Reflective coating. No particular brand is needed, but with computer use you need it. If there is more than one option if it seems like a scam, don't fall for it. Your frame style you like is awesome. Be aware that it may be impossible to get that exact frame or that frame might not fit your head. However there are a lot of look alikes out there. Just show the picture and tell them that that is what you want. When you get the frames make certain they are not too big or too small. You want your eyes to be roughly in the center of the lens without a huge amount of lens room to the outside edges. Also the temples of the frames should fit well and not cause dents on the sides of your head or make the hinges stretch way out. Hope this helps! "
9628,"My right eye is -10.75 and my left eye is -14 (with mild astigmatism mixed in there). Right now I wear glasses. I've been curious about trying out contacts, but I'm a bit nervous that if I do, my brain will stop being able to merge the different sized images if I ever do decide to go back to glasses. Is this something that I would need to consider? My main reason for considering contacts is that it's been getting harder to find glasses where my eyelashes don't touch the lens, because plastic frames with nosepads and smaller frame styles seem to be getting less fashionable. I just got new frames a few months ago so my insurance won't cover new frames for another two years, and my eyelashes touch - and this particular style can't be tilted so I'm stuck with either trimming my eyelashes or cleaning the lenses every few hours.

9633,"Sorry but what you're saying is nonsense. Your eyes don't 'get worse by getting lazy and getting used to wearing glasses all the time'. There's no evidence of this at all. I presume, given what you've described and that you're wearing multifocal glasses with different focal lengths, you're over 45. If so these changes are called presbyopia not 'farsightedness'. They are due to a loss of flexibility in the lens in your eye. No amount of training, exercises etc will help with this. If there was an alternative to glasses as easy as 'training your eyes' do you not think it'd be very popular and widely used? The optometrist you see isn't a 'salesman with an optometrist course'. They're a healthcare professional and will be the best person to advise you. You'll find they will be more helpful if you're not as disrespectful about their position and motivations. "

I looked in internet for any related research and found interesting one here.

What do you think? "
9635,"I'm an optometric technician and I perform visual fields on people daily. Over the years I've had a few patients with anxiety issues regarding the VF machine and it can impact your results. I'll tell you what I tell my patients that are stressing about it. The more relaxed you are the better it will go. When you are anxious and your blood pressure goes up and your monkey brain thinks you are in fight or flight, it really can affect your vision. The best thing to do with the visual field is to remember that although we call it a test, there's no right or wrong. You can't get an F on it. And it also isn't an absolute determination of anything. It's simply a diagnostic tool, just like the slit lamp exam and acuities are diagnostic tools by themselves. The VF tests check multiple points in your central and peripheral vision, depending on which one they are doing I'm guessing a 30-2 or 24-2 for glaucoma checks? The lights at each of these points will vary in brightness, which also makes some look much larger or smaller. This helps determined the threshold of your light sensitivity at each point instead of just ""yes/no"" can you see it. So if you are seeing some dimmer lights and thinking ""wait that can't be a light I click on, it wasn't as bright!"", You are wrong. The less you analyze it the better. You think you see a light? Click. Don't worry about the brightness of it or how quick you saw it or if it looked smaller than the last one, just trust your eyes and if you see a light, click. The results will tell the doctors if you were just being click happy, so as long as you aren't just clicking willy-nilly you will be fine. Don't get in your head about whether or not you are clicking fast enough, or blinking too much, or if your head it straight... that's the techs job. You don't need to worry about anything but focusing on the fixation light and clicking if you think you see a light anywhere. Deep breaths, relax your back and shoulders, blink at your normal rate, and think of it like a whack-a-mole. If you think you saw that little mole fuckers head pop on, swing at it. One last thing! You can always take a break whenever you need to. Most machines are set so that if the patient holds the clicker down it pauses the test, but the technician can also pause it. So if you need to sit back and shake it out for a sec and remind yourself to relax, just tell the tech to pause! It's no big deal to us. We get paid hourly lol. "
9636,PRK cxl otherwise known as the Athens protocol will be effective in re shaping your cornea surface. However thickness and kmax value will need to be considered to estimate the appropriate outcome. If your scan says 85% chance of KC then yes you have KC and yes it is bilateral affecting both eyes. Sclerals should give you amazing vision and comfort if your currently using rgps. PRK and cxl is highness effective In treatment of KC according to multiple website sources mainly Keratoconus support group has some experience as well as on here.

9642,I ended up having really high eye pressure (34 in left and 40 in right) and the Optometrist send me to an ophthalmologist that took me in instantly. He did a bunch of tests and checked for any damage( there is none and he says my nerves look healthy). He prescribed me Combigan eye drops(twice a day for 7 days) and Diamox pills (twice a day for 5 days) to lower the pressure. He also said it will lower since I stopped the steroid eye drops and he wants to check the eye pressure in 4 days. I really don't wanna take the Diamox pill as the side effects are really scary. Do you think I'm okay with just taking Combigan drops today and not taking any Diamox and calling tomorrow to ask if I can avoid Diamox. I'm not sure if it's okay for me to wait until tomorrow to take Diamox or if I should take it immediately. The office is closed now so I can't ask them until tomorrow noon. 
9643,"I'm 60 and am debating whether to have surgery for this. I found out I have a membrane in one eye, about a month ago. I saw an eye doc not because I was experiencing any visual loss but because of eye pain. Turns out it was just dry eye and all that was needed was drops and gel. So the pain issue was resolved. But during that exam, to make sure nothing else was an issue, it was found that I have an epiretinal membrane. The doctor referred me to a specialist who gave me the option for surgery. So here's where I can't make up my mind to have the surgery. I didn't just develop the membrane, I must have had it for a while before seeing my eye doc for that unrelated pain. In fact, the doc said they call this ""sudden realization."" But now that it's been pointed out to me I notice the blurriness. But overall it's not terrible. I can see fine close up. I only really notice it while driving and looking out over far distances. I don't have that wavy line symptom that some people get. The reason for sitting on the fence about the surgery is from what I understand it's not always successful in restoring most of your vision. But even more than that I'm nervous about complications like detached retina. What I can't find any information on is how many people who have this just get used to it or actually have surgery. I had a Weiss Ring a few years ago, it was a pretty bad one but I got used to that. Do people get used to an epiretinal membrane as well? Any info or advice is welcome! "

If no history of migraines or presentation after age 45-55 then I will get MRI brain. I've seen MEWDS cause odd areas missing from one eye but should be apparent on exam or imaging with red-free imaging (i don't think it requires FA).

9646,So I just went to the eye doctor because my vision in my left eye got a little blurry suddenly last year. They ran some tests to find out I have keratoconus in both eyes (idk if that's always the case) Vision in my right eye is still near perfect. Left is a little worse but manageable without glasses/contacts. However after hearing it gets progressively worse into your 30's and my doctor telling me I will get contacts and when that doesn't help anymore I'll need a transplant I'm pretty scared. I've always seen perfect so this is a bombshell. Did any of you experience this and what did you do about it or what can I expect. Also my doctor didn't say anything about CXL but is that worth looking into early on?

To fill the distance prescription you simply just leave off the add power and use the distance PD of 65. Hopefully this all makes sense. Easier to explain verbally sometimes! "
9648,"I am getting old (44m) and need glasses for reading, and computer use. I tried reading glasses (+1) and thought wow, this is awesome, I can read again!

I have spent about 15x more on the varifocals (<U+00A3>17 reading, <U+00A3>305 on varifocals and that included a 33% discount on the lenses), and despite all the wonderful testing and getting the best lenses they had on offer, I hate them so far. The area of the lense which brings text into focus is tiny. With my reading glasses I can see my whole monitor perfectly; with the varifocals I can see about 10%, and that is surrounded by a circle of... not blurry as such but kinda wobbly. Reading a book is uncomfortable, I can't can't read a line in a small book without having to turn my head. Typing this on my phone, the edge of the phone is not a straight line and if I move my head even a tiny amount, the line wobbles.

9650,"35 year old male, I had cataract surgery on my left eye at the end of January 2021 with a ZCB00 monofocal IOL. I had a cataract in this eye for about 5 years, only got really bad beginning of 2020 but with COVID, surgery was delayed until 2021. I went for a prescription check 3 weeks ago, I only have a -.5 astigmatism in that eye. I am experiencing some side effects such as ghosting / double vision in my outside peripheral vision. I also get very bad eye headaches in light, if I'm wearing sunglasses, the light that comes in the side is very bothersome. My eyelids feel very heavy as the day progresses. I went to see my surgeon today and he said that I am experiencing most of these issues because of dry eye. He prescribed me some Hylo eye drops and told me to just follow up with my optometrist. Does that seem like a reasonable explanation or just something to get me off the chair for now? How would that cause ghosting / double vision? I plan to follow his instructions but just wanted to get an outside opinion for now. "
9651,"Vision is not a direct measure of KC severity or changes. But if you get decent vision with conventional soft lenses, your KC is almost certainly mild. I'm in the US, so I don't know what equipment a UK optician would typically have. In the US, many optometrist have equipment for doing corneal topography but certainly not all of them. To me it is always obvious whether or not they are doing topography. Topography is not the only way of evaluating KC. Topography wasn't even generally available for the first 20 or so years of my KC experience. But it is certainly much more definitive than other methods. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have an exam by an ophthalmologist to get a better check point on where you are at with your KC and your eye health in general. You are getting to the age where other eye problems can start to appear and KC plus another eye problem isn't fun. "
9652,"I hate to say this, but some people just cannot wear contacts at all. I'm one of them. In my case it has to do with my astigmatism and chronic dry eye. But I have definitely seen cases like yours. Sometimes you can never get perfect, at least with a soft lens. ( You could get close with a hard lens or a Rigid Gas Permeable as those places DO spin and cut to order still. However getting the patient over the hump to be able to wear them is a trick. And if you have tight fitting lids that might not work either, though I have quite a large portion of +50yr olds still wearing rgps with very tight lids that just got used to it forever ago when that was the only option besides enormous glasses and they have no desire to change now. Though fitting young people in them is a bear. They are uncomfortable and you have to muscle through them. But you could discuss them as an option if you aren't satisfied with your Oasys.

With having Sjogren's, I'm sure you are aware that autoimmunes usually come in multiples, so there is a good chance you might actually have PPP instead of D.E. It's also important to make sure, because if you do have PPP instead of D.E., 30% of those with a form of psoriasis also end up with Psoriatic arthritis and if psoriatic arthritis isn't properly treated, it can erode and destroy your joints. I also was diagnosed for 10 years with Dyshidrotic eczema and it was just recently switched to PPP when i developed major, major, arthritis symptoms and they realized they had diagnosed it wrong years prior. Good luck! "

9660,"Hey there. So about a month ago I had an episode of BPPV complete with nystagmus. Physical therapist did an epley maneuver which cleared up the vertigo. I've noticed though now at night when I'm trying to sleep, I will have brief horizontal saccadic movements that only last a split second. I'll probably get one every 5 minutes or so. This has been going on every night, but strictly only at night with my eyes closed. About 7 days ago I started to get a headache, and on one night the saccadic movement was much more pronounced and lasted about 3 seconds total and persisted after I opened my eyes, but I haven't had one like that since. Just the small ones. I have an appointment with an optometrist to get my eyes checked on Tuesday, and my headache had mostly subsided (neck really sore too, I'm wondering if it was a tension headache?) I'm wondering if I should try to see an opthalmologist instead of an optometrist, any ideas? History: None, 20/20 vision, no family history. "
9661,Im 20 years old male. My opthalmologist performed a dilated eye exam on me. Found out I have lattice degeneration and vitreoretinal tuft. I'm high myopia with both eyes with around -10 diopters. My doctor doesn't see any holes or tears which is great but still have high risk. He recommend me to go for prophylactic laser surgery to seal which decrease risk of retinal tears and holes. My main concern is blindness. I'm not sure if I have pathological myopia which gradually worsen as I age. I ask the doctor but he said I probably don't have it unless my myopia worsen. I feel like my life is pointless with all these surgeries or whatever treatment if one day in 5 to 10 years I'm going blind anyway. Might considered getting euthanasia/assisted suicide if that happens.

9665,"Withdrawing from steroids?? Had been on tapering schedule of lotemax 3 times/ week for a full week without any issues until symptoms started below. sorry if it's long... was trying to be as specific as possible. **Started last Monday night(8/5)**: Intense burning aching pain in right eye that also caused insane headache but dissipated in about an hour **Tues(8/6)**: those same symptoms on and off all day long **Wed(8/7)**: checked in with ophtho. He said there was a bit of inflammation going on in left corner of right eye- along nasal cavity. Was put on lotemax 4 times that day. And Twice a day for two weeks starting the following day. **Thurs**: had that extreme burning aching pain again, worst migraine of my life, heart racing, felt like I wanted to faint. Called doc on call and he said to put an extra drop of lotemax in for the night (total of 3 drops) and to come in to get it checked tomorrow just in case. But after I put in my second drop for the night, I felt completely fine so I didn't do the third. **Friday**: checked in with ophtho again and described symptoms of last night. Said there was a bit of inflammation going on still, but no break in epithelium of cornea or anything abnormal. He said it's probably that I was having rebound inflammation/ was withdrawing from the steroids. Kept me on lotemax twice a day until my official follow up on the 20th. **Since the weekend**, it's been different like every day. I've been having on and off pain and headache. Some days my eye feels great though. Other times, my eye feels like there's this stabbing aching pain( like someone stabbed it with a small knife and left it in there) with a terrible headache. Steroids have helped a little but haven't helped anymore as much as it did the previous days. **Today** I had that pain, took a nap and it felt better, but then there's been the lingering uncomfortable small aching feeling in my eye( like something might be in it). Really have felt extremely aggravated all day bc of it for some reason and I'm never usually aggravated for anything. Pressure was 21 in right eye on Friday. Controlled with timolol and lotanoprost as I am a steroid responder. I'm 21, Have a HX of herpes Keratitis in right eye. On Valtrex twice a day for that. Is this truly symptoms of rebound inflammation/ withdrawing from steroids??? Or could something else be truly going on? Didn't think withdrawing from steroids was a thing tbh lol, but it's driving me absolutely NUTS. Feel like I just want to cry sometimes bc of how frustrating, uncomfortable and sometimes painful, it's been and can't really focus on anything while that's going on. Dont notice any changes in vision. There's no redness or anything that I can see. Been having a bit of photosensitvity in affected eye when I go outside.

9671,"This is correct. That is what we tell students: the correct question when doing a refraction is not "" which one you like better"" but ""can you still read"". Younger patients love forcing with their eyes. Accommodation brings smaller, darker, sharper images, which we equate to ""better"". ( accommodative micropsia+myosis) The main drawbacks of an over minus prescription is potential for myopia progression, and fatigue. With that said, most young myopes won't like/tolerate the max + or least - rx. So it's a fine line. Those 2 prescriptions you are mentioning are just 0.25 apart, so no big deal. Choose the one you like the best. If there is a pseudo myopia component, as you get older, your vision ""will get better"" ie slowly, those numbers will get close to zero. "

9673,"As someone who has won the battle with Keratoconus, I like to answer all of our newly diagnosed people with this message :) \-First of all, do not panic. KC does NOT mean the end of your eyesight or your world. You are now embarking on a journey, a KC journey. I was diagnosed in 1968 and 1970 when there was no such thing as CXL, Sclerals and transplant procedures were primitive. I had successful transplants (1980, 1982) and I am now in glasses 20/25 and 20/40.. My advice to you is: 1. Not panic 2. Find a doctor and lens fitter that you trust. It's YOUR eyesight. Get a 2nd opinion if you need it. 3. Follow his/her instructions 4. If you have ANY problems or concerns, contact them. Even when it is after clinic hours, there is always someone on call to help. Yes, you have support online, something I didn't have in my day; however, run everything you read online by your doctor before any treatment; even advice from me :) There are so many great treatments today. The chances of needing transplants are much slimmer than in my day. You should do fine. Most get relief by CXL and Scleral lenses. I hope this calms your fears a bit :) \*\*\*\*\*Update,\*\*\*\*\*\* July, 2021 Saw my doctor on the 26th.. 39 and 41-year-old grafts are still clear and healthy.

9677,"The discussion around PD is a lot more nuanced and complex than you'd think. I honestly wouldn't expect you to understand because you don't know what goes into making a good pair of glasses. It might seem as simple as doing a 2 second measurement but there is a underlying liability undertaking involved in that measurement. The standard industry practice is for the O.D. to measure your refractive error and for the optician (the guy who sells your glasses) to measure your PD. This way, it's clear which party is responsible if the glasses aren't working great when they come back. By asking your optometrist to measure your PD, it muddies the liability of the glasses a bit. Suppose you buy glasses online and you feel like you can't see too well out of them. Normally, you'd take them back to the optician who made them and they check the fitting and make sure there were no errors in manufacturing. If the optician confirms that everything was done properly, you then see the eye doctor to make sure the Rx is correct. Your optician and your eye doctor normally has no problem trouble shooting this for you because you paid them for a product and a service and they want to make sure you're happy with that product/service. Now imagine you bought glasses online instead. The first problem is the optician (the online store) refuses to measure your PD (and frames this as if your doctor is the one refusing to measure you). Let's say your doctor gives you a PD. What happens if you don't like the glasses? You certainly don't go back to the online retailers because there is no physical location. So you go back to your doctor. The doctor is obligated to take time out of his day and turn away from paying customers to help troubleshoot your glasses because he provided a fitting for you (your PD), but he's not exactly thrilled to do it because he never got paid for the PD and isn't getting paid to waste time figuring out why you don't like your glasses. He's also not thrilled because he knows there is a good chance the fault lies with the manufacturer you bought glasses from, and yet he's the one meticulously troubleshooting your glasses for free. Then, when he tell you that the glasses were made incorrectly the end result is everyone is unhappy. The patient is left convinced that the doctor could have done more to ""fix"" the glasses. And the doctor is frustrated that instead of making money seeing paying customers he has to have this stressful and difficult conversation with a customer that isn't even paying. That's not to say no places offer PD. I offer PD, but with the disclaimer that I absolutely refuse to troubleshoot glasses if they're bought somewhere else (no ifs, ands, or buts) because I am a busy practice and I don't have time to baby-sit non-paying customers (and my patients in the waiting room WILL give you the stink eye as they are forced to wait for me to help you with your cheap demands). If you have a problem with your glasses I'll tell you to go back to where you bought it, or charge you a fee to look at it and *schedule* you for whenever I can get around to it. Other places offer a PD but will charge a small fee for it (to cover liabilty). You have to understand, doctors aren't in the healthcare business to *""disrupt the industry""*. We're trying to provide for our family, keep the lights on, and pay student loan bills, and we use our passion for vision and eye health to achieve those goals. We can't do that if we give services away for free and sell glasses at a fifty cent margin. Those online retailers are losing money on glasses and contacts to generate a lot of media attention and capture investors. They're 100% in it to play the stock-market game, not to help you see clearly. And it shows. A lot of online contact lens distributors sell lenses that will give you an eye infection. And the quality control on online glasses is pretty poor compared to most physical locations (I once ordered non-astigmatism glasses from Zenni as a student and when I checked the prescription on them after getting my degree they had astigmatism correction.... how do you even do that?) Oh yeah, by the way you can just look in the mirror and measure your own PD. Honestly, that's what I did *when* I was using Zenni back when I was in undergrad. "

Also, the people who post regularly are often people who have severe symptoms. It's entirely possible that your mom will have a mild case of the illness and do well, so don't get too scared by what you read here.

For every year you go to school you get a bit more nearsighted. <U+00B7> Myopia is not just hereditary our lifestyle plays a role. <U+00B7> In Asia in some countries up to 80% or 90% are nearsighted. <U+00B7> The WHO estimated that 1/2 of the world's population will be shortsighted within 30years. (I don't think we are taking enough steps to prevent this from happening) <U+00B7> The most important thing is to send children outside into the sunlight for 2 hours every day. We know this is the best way to prevent nearsightedness. Outside the light intensity is 100 times higher. (even with the brightest of bulbs). "

9698,Does anyone have any sort of good solutions for wearing a face mask and not having it be insufferable with your eyes. I'm struggling so bad. I don't even wear fabric masks anymore because they're the absolute worst and the nose wire on surgical masks doesn't help. I resort to wearing a KN-95 because it's the most form fitting but it's also terrible. Idk if it's my face shape or what but wearing a face mask is horrendous no matter what I do. I even got a trial of those moisture chamber glasses and both sets of frames didn't even fit my face correctly and still bothered my eyes when I wore a mask. I don't know what to do and I'm running out of steam. I want to be able to go out and do things safely while wearing a mask and right now the most I can do is a quick grocery trip. Does anyone have any advice or mask recommendations? 
9699,Hello guys so I'm 22 years old and I've got diagnoses 2 years ago. I've undergone a cxl surgery two months ago. Prior the surgery I was unable to see clearly with glasses and the keratoconus was progressive. I had hard lenses and I was able to see with them clearly. Now after the cxl I'm seeing clearer with the old glasses! When should I change the prescription? AndI had a friend who've already undergone cxl and had intacs after that with the same doctor of mine and he can now see without even wearing glasses!! Is it worth it to try it out ??? I need advice! And btw my right eye is moderately affected while the keratoconus is mild in my left eye. Thanks in advance! 
9700,"I have a very high myopia prescription, -12 in one eye and -9 in the other. I also now have cataracts. I am almost 60. My doctor is recommending the basic, mono-focal lenses for distance and did not mention mono-vision as an option. I am ok with wearing glasses for close and computer work. I often wear reading glasses with contacts now anyway, though without my contacts I can read pretty well. However, I just want to be sure that my vision will actually be corrected with glasses. I am an artist and really want to see clearly at all distances whether with or without glasses. Of course, now my vision is not clear at most distances so this will be an improvement regardless! Just seeking some reassurance that I'll be able to see clearly. I see people complaining about their near vision after cataract surgery. Thanks very much. "

9702,"Does anyone have reactions to this? Please don't comment if you're one of those who won't/doesn't wear masks for everyone's safety. I very much need actual experience from any answers. 30F here. I find it really difficult to breathe with the mask on. I start to sweat, feel really hot which then turns into feeling borderline faint and on top of that my lungs were hurting enough that I actually needed to stop moving to rest and catch my breath. On my walk home from the grocery store (which was only five streets away from home) I had to stop twice (away from people of course) and needed to remove my mask because I felt like I actually couldn't breathe and legitimately needed to rest because my lungs, entire chest and head was hurting. I did have pneumonia as a child so maybe that plays a factor into it and perhaps my lungs/throat are just messed up from that. Anyone here with SS that has also had pneumonia? I don't really know how to go about proceeding. Wearing a mask makes me feel like I'm going to faint and my lungs are on fire but I should probably be wearing it because I imagine we are more susceptible to catching covid. It's just absolute torture going out anywhere though. It's enough pain that I really feel like I need to sit/collapse and wait it out when I reach the point of feeling more and more like I'm unable to breathe. "
9703,"Hi! I had cataract surgery a year or so ago to have a monofocal lens put in my left eye, and I've recently noticed some issues that I'm concerned about given I'm 17 and my eye hasn't fully matured (according to my ophthalmologist, more on him later) and I thought I'd pop onto this sub and see if I can get some answers before I go see my ophthalmologist. Context: I'm a 17 year old who used to be short sighted in both eyes with prescription glasses at around 3.0. I had cataract surgery a year ago and got a monofocal put in my left eye which leaves me longsighted but also shortsighted in that I can't see directly in front of my face and can't see things which are too far away. The issues I've been having are that with glasses on, both my eyes have trouble focusing on things, and I've found that in photos my left eye tends to drift to the side if the camera isn't in an optimal range to focus on. Also, lately it seems that the my right eye is slowly becoming longsighted as well, and I'm not sure if that's because my eyes need to be coordinated in order to see things near to my face or for other reasons. The reason why I'm on this sub and not in the waiting room is because my ophthalmologist wasn't exactly a people person, meaning that throughout my time with him he tended to be rude and standoffish and sometimes outright refusing to answer certain questions because he said I 'wouldn't have to worry about it as \[cataract surgery\] is a really simple surgery'. I'd get a second opinion, but with COVID and all finances are tight and I can't afford to visit another doctor for the time being. I'm also interested in knowing if anyone from this sub has operated on patients in my age range before, and if so what the long term consequences are, and some do's and don'ts. Will it be possible anytime in the future to get another surgery to replace the lens with a multifocal instead? Is a multifocal better than a monofocal lens? Any and all help is appreciated! "
9704,"So for the past five years or so my vision keeps getting worse about every 6-8 months. My current prescription is -5.75. I've been near sighted ever since I was a teenager, however my vision didn't get bad so often back then. Probably every 3-4 years my vision would change. However, like I said it seems that my vision has been declining a lot more quickly the past 5 years compared to my late teenage years to early 20s. I've had multiple tests now so I'm not concerned about going blind, but the eye specialist recommended low dose atropine eye drops to slow down the progression for I assume, forever since I'm 29. I started taking them three days ago. I take them at night before I go to bed. But ever since taking them I can't go outside at all, even when it's cloudy, it feels like my eyes is burning out of my head. I also can't see anything up close with my glasses and contacts. Even without wearing them, I can hardly see anything up close. So now I'm basically not near or far sighted. Should I continue to take them? I'm tired of having to get new glasses every year, but I can't go my whole life not being able to see outdoors or see anything up close. "

Immediately after the surgery I saw my night vision got worse, the Phakic lenses I have have a lens flare to them & I could get rid of them with a low dose of [pilocarpine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilocarpine) eye drop which helps constrict the pupils. IDK if it is the same thing that is causing you trouble at night, This drop helps constrict the pupil but it would work for several hours. This is what my Dr. suggested at the time. Using the drops caused discomfort but it was not painful & that discomfort would last for several minutes only. He used to say not to use it frequently but i stopped using them since I was able to manage myself at night. Check with your doctor to see if these would be suitable for your case, it helped mine, My job is includes a lot of reading & I can manage around 10 hours of it, past that it gets difficult & I get a headache, I got a prescription for new glasses, change is for my dominant right eye so hopefully that helps, My thought on the surgery is that it bought the comfort & to skip that morning / night ritual to put the hard lenses in & out, & to doze off & nap without thinking if I am wearing them,.

9720,"I don't wear glasses or contacts. Let me describe a recurring situation which happened most recently this past night. Woke up at 2AM. Right eye was very watery, there were tears all over my eyelashes and spilling out onto the outside of my lower eyelid. The eye also had a moderate stinging feeling(5/10). Right nostril seemed plugged up. Left eye was normal. Got up, washed the tears out with water. Stinging sensation continued. Noticed that my right eye was quite blurry, looking at a LED clock for example the numbers looked blurry like I was looking through water, even though there didn't seem to be excess tears in my eye at that point. Opened an OTC eye drop (B+L Soothe PF) and put 2 drops in my right eye. Instantly felt my nose unclog and a feeling of dripping in my throat. It almost felt like some of the eye drops went through my eye into my nose and down my throat(is that even possible?) Waited a moment and put a 3rd eye drop in. Waited 5 minutes and noticed the blurriness lessened a bit and stinging lessened also(2/10). Laid back down for 15 minutes with my eyes mostly open. The stinging gradually went away completely as well as the blurriness. Slept and eye did not sting or water for the rest of the night. Now this situation basically is happening 2 times a week consistently for the past month, always randomly in the middle of the night with my right eye very watery. It started in April a few times, then didn't happen at all again until mid July when it started again randomly a couple of times a week. I had a dilated eye exam in early August because I noticed a bunch of jelly and smoke like floaters in both eyes but the exam didn't find anything unusual. What could be causing my eye to water so much at night, and what causes the stinging and blurriness? Always seemingly the right eye, and it never happens twice in one night. After I wash the tears out it's fine for the rest of the night, and never happens during the day. (although my eyes sometimes feel like they sting a bit during the day, but they don't water excessively) Anything I could try to perhaps prevent it from happening? "

During the day, normal - they don't feel dry or uncomfortable. I have a couple of 'signature' veins! But nothing that seems out of the ordinary. I've only noticed this over the last few months, because the house I moved into has a different bathroom setup. No window so I have to turn the light on - and the mirror faces the doorway. As dryness doesn't bother me during the day - could this be some sort of blood pressure issue? Sleep apnea? I am 31, no known health problems, not overweight.

9728,"OK. Let's get real. There are hundreds of eye diseases that cause permanent irreversible blindness. This is not one of them. This is completely treatable and, therefore, is not the end of the world as another post mentioned. First, a majority of patients get very good vision and never need any kind of treatment other than rigid gas permeable contact lenses or scleral lenses. Surgery can be considered but is not necessary in most patients. For those who progress over time, cross linking can be done. INTACS can be inserted to reduced astigmatism. A cornea transplant that has 98% success (which is an incredible number) can be done where the entire cornea is replaced with a new one from a donor (no matching needed because the cornea has no blood vessels) = cornea transplant. Or, just the front part of the cornea can be transplanted (the sick part) leaving the normal back part alone = DALK (deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty). I've had KC in both eyes since I was 17. I'm 62 now and still doing well just wearing glasses. I became an eye surgeon and performed about 40,000 eye operations with excellent vision in both of my eyes. I've had surgery on both eyes. Doing just fine. Relax dude. It's treatable. There are plenty of folks who develop diseases that are untreatable. Celebrate the fact that you can treat this with contact lenses to start with. "
9729,"Hi all, Long time reader, first post. I was diagnosed with KC in my early teens and have been managing since. My right eye vision, without correction, is horrendous. My left eye thankfully (knock on wood) is pretty good on its own. I'm now in my early 30s. For my right eye I wear a ""piggyback""<U+009D> lens system, which is a soft lens underneath with the hard lens on top. I started with just the hard lens, then moved to a hybrid hard/soft lens, and am now in this configuration, which works pretty well. I was using monthly soft contacts for the underneath and tried switching to dailies about 2 years ago, which I've found to work pretty well. After a long day of wear (15+ hours) I notice a buildup of what I'll call ""eye crud""<U+009D> on my lenses, don't know if it's on the hard part or soft part, but it substantially affects my vision in that eye. My guess is that it's some kind of eye proteins and other stuff, don't know exactly what it is. I also feel very dry in my right eye throughout the day. I've tried a few different kinds of OTC drops which are ok, but haven't stuck with them religiously. I'm wondering if any of my fellow KC support group folks have had a similar experience with this or a similar setup? Or any advice generally on how to deal with this? Also curious if anyone has tried this kind of setup with daily vs. monthly soft lenses and what brand you've found to be best. Thanks to everyone, stay safe and goodnight. "

Wore them from about 4 pm when I had my makeup done to about 10pm and I had my glasses as backup and I'm sure during that point they were irritating me) and started trying to build up wear. Both eyes are astigmatic; my left basically negligible, my right enough to need a toric lens. When I put them in for the first time yesterday (I took them out after an hour, today I'm trying 2 hours and they've been in maybe 10-15mins) it took a couple mins for my left eye to adjust obviously, and after that I couldn't feel it, but my right eye I could still feel it and it would come and go and feel blurry.

Migraine with aura is almost always a neurological thing and has to do with bloodflow in the optic part of your brain, rather than anything to do with eye specifically. IF this happened suddenly and you are really worried, I would be seeing a doctor about your general health - eg blood pressure etc, possibly an MRI to make sure there is nothing neurologically wrong.

9739,"Hi, I have a question regarding the accuracy of non contact (air puff) tonometers. I have had wall to wall readings with both hand held devices as well as the one that is stationary. It seems like most of the doctors in my area do not use the Goldman tonometer which is supposed to be the most accurate. Anyway, the readings have been from 16-21 and once even 23 in one eye. Most often the reading has been around 19. Consequently, I do not know whether I have ocular hypertension or not although it certainly seems borderline. However, I do know that I get slightly anxious before the measurement because I am anticipating the air puff (I can feel my heart beat get faster despite my best efforts to remain calm) and then when the air puff happens my head usually goes back as a reaction. I do not know enough about how these tonometers work to understand whether any of this makes a difference for the readings. The optometrists never seem concerned about this affecting the results though. I have researched online about the accuracy of non contact tonometers and it seems they are fairly good when your IOP is low but the higher it is, the less accurate the non contact tonometers get. The difference could apparently even be +2 to 3 mmg compared to GAT. I will try to get my IOP measured by GAT but in the meantime, I was just wondering if anyone could comment on the reliability and accuracy of non contact tonometers and whether sensitivity and reaction to the air puffs could alter the results.

Burning eyes, red and dry eyes af as if I opened my eyes for one hour in a pool (I have NEVER experienced that before) 2. Sudden weird vision since the symptoms appeared with high photophobia. As if I looked through a window, everything seems to be zoomed in with a focus and I can not see what is next to it. When I read a text on my computer it is like my vision focus on one word and forget the other. When I look down at line on the ground or in the supermarket my eyes feels so lost. I noticed I can not put high luminosity on my phone or computer but only the lowest possible. 3. Migraines (?) I guess. Located only in temples, if you read Naruto it is like I have a byakugan, my veins temple are aching and my eyebrows are tough. 4. Hair loss. It is one of the saddest since I have long hair and I used to love them. At the same time my vision has changed last year, I experienced a big hole in my hair. It grew back and it has happened again last month. 5. Floaters (never had one). I am getting a bit used to it as it is not painful, it is just sad that when I look at a white wall all I can see it black dots. But it is okay. I also deal with fatigue. Test done : MRI & scanner : clear, only weird thing the pituitary gland/hypophys is abnormaly huge. But they dont know why. ENT : sinus are clear. Ophtalmologist : I have seen like 5 different. Perfect vision. I performed 15 sessions of visual training but it did not improved. My eyes are not dry according to him. Blood test : Very low leucocyt. Idk what it means and my doctor did not know as well. Neurologist : think it is maybe uncommon migraines Medication : Artelac for my eyes Sanmigran for the migraines I used to loooove my life and enjoy it. Now all I can think about 24/7 is why I suddenly had all these mystery symptom that doctors do not understand ? They tell me it is stress. It could be but I never had one good day without symptoms since it started. It is permanent. Do you have similar experiences ? Any idea of what it might be ? Any advices please ? Thank you, take care. "
9744,"That but the cylinder designates an astigmatism though so while it's small it might actually make a significant difference, especially for headaches and such. The brain has to work harder to process if they have an astigmatism that isn't being corrected for. I'd recommend - while not top-tier, but cost-effective, buying from an online glasses provider like Zenni, EyeBuyDirect, or Firmo. Make sure you input your prescription correctly and pick a frame that you think will sit on your face well. Worst case they're mostly under 70-100$ including lenses and in most cases if something is wrong customer support may send you a new pair (in my experience). Good luck OP! "
9745,"Hey all, I just realized it's been around a decade since I begin my Keratoconus journey. It all began when I was approximately 17 years old (2010). I began seeing ghosts and haloes surrounding objects, and noticed that it's easily fixable by squeezing my eyes, so I chuckled it up to be something not very serious and easily treatable, and that's why I haven't pursued treatment, until the condition turned into a very advanced case. Before approaching a medical staff, I already began researching my symptoms, of which Google provided with the diagnosis: Keratoconus. My self-diagnosis was confirmed by doctors who topographed my corneas. By late 2012 I undergone CXL on my left eye and cornea transplant on my right eye. Both were done succusfully. Within few days from transplant I was shocked as I could easily and perfectly read the letters on the computer screen completely unaided. While my left eye's keratoconus stopped progressing, the eye vision quality was still very bad, that's until I undergone topography-guided PRK on it in 2015, after which I could see 20/20 with hyperopic correction (or 20/20 unaided by manually focusing my eye). Those 3 first treatments were the most beneficial and the most important, because I acheived 20/20 (although not with perfect quality) after them. Since then I conducted 2 other treatments: PRK on my right eye (2016), which was very beneficial, however regressed a lot, probably because my cornea still recovered from stitches removal + regression of the treatment itself as in common on grafts. 5th treatment was Mini ARK on my left eye in 2018, which corrected some of the irregular astigmatism, so I can better watch computer screens and televisions - after this treatment I noticed that I'm able to see the 3D effect of movies completely unaided. My lastest prescription is : Right Eye SPH +1.75 CYL -3.50 Axis 65 / Left Eye SPH +3.50 CYL -0.75 Axis 70. I doubt I would ever use contact lenses as I'm very intolerant of them. How can one really use them when ""sometimes"" your eyes get reddish and don't allow you to insert and them, let alone the uncomfortable sensations, side effects, and the inability to work certain conditions with them. But I can completely understand how some find them appropriate in their situations. In my current condition I don't even use spectacles, unless when driving, or when using computer or television. I'm satisfied with my current condition for the most part except for when I want to watch movies or shows, because the subtitles have ghosting around them and it somehow irritates me and prevent my immersion in the media, so I'm unable to enjoy them to the fullest which is of a concern to me. Further treatments are available options but I don't know if I would have additional ones yet. If anyone wants to ask me anythink I'm here to listen and provide a commentary. "
9746,"I started a new clinical rotation for school last Monday where I'm sitting &watching a computer all day. Since Tuesday last week, my eyes have been super tired, straining, dry, sometimes light pink, itchy, burning, a little pain,& like I feel like I'm looking up a lot to stretch but it feels like they're stretching on the inside of the eye if that makes sense? Anyways, I've taken this to be eye allergies cause allergy eye drops are the only thing to relieve them for several hours before it starts again. (No other allergy symptoms) I've been rubbing my eyes a ton more than usual this last week because of this. I've also started getting my winter super dry skin&it's on my face this year too. Today my face was super dry when I woke up and also noticed my under eyes were much much more wrinklier than I've ever noticed. (I'm 30). Later at my rotation, I realized when I'm focusing on the screen or I guess in general on something, my eyes squint but mostly under the eye. You can see my skin move as I focus/concentrate. I continued noticing this throughout the day and constantly caught myself having to let go, over and over. Anyone know why this is or how to stop this? Maybe this is why my eyes are so tired? Also have always been sensitive to sunlight, squinting a lot when outside. (Excuse my shiny face; aquaphor to the rescue). "
9747,"Hello! About 2 weeks ago at my routine eye exam but eye doctor noticed that both of my optic nerves were a bit swollen. She said i shouldn't really worry too much but she was going to refer my to my GP to see what he wanted to do. (She also said it was the minimum degree of when she would refer, but wanted to be safe) I wasn't having any symptoms at that time. However I have a history of migraines and allergies. But I have major anxiety so as soon as she told me I went and googled and am not 100 percent convinced that I have a brain tumor. I started getting a headache and blurry vision and feeling like my head was in a cloud. I couldn't concentrate or remember much and I automatically assumed, because of google, I had a brain tumor. I ended up in the ER where they did a CT scan and it was normal and they also did a lumbar puncture which my opening pressure was 10 so he was able to rule out pseudotumor. I have an appointment with a neurologist next week, but was just wondering if anyone ever had an experience with swollen optic nerves being nothing? Can it do up and down? If there was a tumor technically my spinal pressure would be up, right? Thank you so much. "
9748,Yea optimel is very pricy I've heard of it but have wavered because I have manuka honey in a jar. I'm guessing it's completely different from making your own? I've been convincing myself of that in order to run off from the price of optimel. Yes sugary drinks make my skin on my scalp itch badly or sugary foods. Never happens when I eat home cooked meals though. Interesting I've had my Chalazion in my eye for about 5 years and I'm in my early 20s . Does optimel drain the cyst or?? I also have been using an eyebright eyewash . It burst my styes when they were fresh but doesn't do much for Chalazions really. 
9749,how do you take them 10-15 times a day? I take 3 eye drops a day and even that is soemwhat of a pain to do. 
9750,"If you didn't have an OCT and visual field test, and you have high-normal pressures, it might make sense to do those tests. I went to my regular ophthalmologist and both he and another doctor at my clinic missed my glaucoma. I was mid 30s age range btw. I went to a specialist anyway for a second opinion and had it confirmed through tests. My nerve looked healthy to the regular ophthalmologists too, but to a specialist, he saw something else. Just adding my experience, for anyone with higher 'normal' pressures that have never done the usual round of tests. "
9751,"Thank you for your response! I have my RGPs for about 15 years now and have been happy with them minus the discomfort and this just doesn't go away. So I have high hopes for the scleral lenses. I've also lost some RGPs, but I think the fit is actually pretty good with mine and they don't fall out, but again they just hurt far too often. Curious to see how they will feel and I won't for sure not get rid of my RGPs right away. "
9752,"All good, but toric lenses if they fit are as cheap as any disposable lens; $100 or so for 3 months. Either way, sclerals will be better, Toric's just might have been handy for 'I need them in quick, and 60% vision is enough' like, if you forget to take the garbage out or something. "
9753,"I am 62, have had surgery in both eyes, and I'm living my life just fine. It's a perfectly treatable problem. There are thousands of other diseases that are not treatable and progressive. This is not one of them. It's treatable with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery or any combination of the above. Just relax. Worrying and anxiety won't change anything and worrying about a completely treatable problem does sound a little excessive. "
9754,The primordial criterium is that your vision is stable for at least 2-3 years. Usually this occurs round the age of 21-23. It can depend from one person to another of coarse. 
9755,"Several remarks: 1) The symptoms (even the GERD) are consistent with Sjogren's, but the length of time is extremely short. 2) Seronegative Sjogren's is super common, particularly in younger people. The longer you have the disease, the more likely your SSA, SSB, and ANA are to flip. Seeing as you are 20, it's not impossible that your markers just aren't there yet. 3) If it keeps progressing and you really need to know, definitely go after the biopsy and don't focus too much on some of the horror stories. The reality is that the procedure is extremely helpful (since seronegative Sjogren's is so common) and low risk *if* you find the right surgeon. I recommend finding a good surgeon, paying the extra money, and doing it. "
9756,"""Oblique"" is not what makes it difficult. Glasses and soft toric contacts are just as effective at axis 45 as they are at 90 and 180. ""Irregular"" is what makes KC difficult. The ""cone"" protrudes so the surface isn't a smooth football any more, it's ""irregular."" "
9757,"I can't fully express the amount of grief this has caused me. I have several chronic health problems, but none of which has impacted my life as greatly as this. I was diagnosed at 29 after struggling with bad vision for several years. Keratoconus isn't my only eye problem, so it took 8 months from that point to get to my first lense fitting. I have two eye specialists working together and I've been able to see for 5 - 6 months. It's been great. I never want to go back. My childhood optometrist noticed something was wrong with my eyes when I was 12 and told me I was likely going blind. I remember him telling me he'd never seen this before and he was scared for me. That is an awful, awful thing to tell anyone, but most especially a child and it came back later to rear it's ugly head. The specialist they transferred me to at the time found nothing wrong but dry eye. So, my parents didn't want to do any further follow up and it was put to bed for a while. My experience with Keratoconus has been the fluctuating astigmatism that worsened over time. It'd seem bad and then seem better, which made me feel crazy or dramatic. That started when I was 18, though maybe sooner. At a point, it stopped seeming better and only worsened. It took over a decade and for the disease to significantly progress before I found a doctor that understood Keratoconus. So, for 10+ years, I thought I was either crazy or slowly going blind with no one who could help me. I went to countless specialists, even a neuro ophthalmologist. They couldn't find anything physically wrong all while my vision continued to get worse and worse. Some were nice about it and tried to console me even though they couldn't help me. More often, they were impatient and dismissive. Sometimes just mean. I've been accused of drug seeking and mental illness to the point that it prevented me from seeking any health care at all. I knew it wasn't mental health and I wasn't so special that I was the only one with this problem - but I'd never heard of anyone with my symptoms and my doctors were stumped. It truly seemed hopeless. It was very isolating. It caused me a great amount of emotional distress and significantly detailed my life. Thankfully, I have a good support system in my partner and friends. I have a really positive attitude toward the whole eye disease thing. My diagnosis was one of the absolute best, most deeply validating days of my life. It has only brought positive changes and my quality of life is greatly improved. Like, I have a life now. I don't care about the eye disease, I cared about living without a diagnosis or with any treatment options. I'm learning to drive now that I can see and I have more freedom/security in my career options. Nothing can be as bad/hard as it was, it's only looking up from here. I'm not going blind - at least not from Keratoconus. And I have a fantastic medical team working together to make sure I can keep seeing indefinitely or for as long as possible. Now, I feel incredibly lucky and grateful. I tried to plan a nice life for myself with good people and now I can enjoy it. "
9758,"I think are not floaters. I'm 18 and i see floaters only looking the sky but is normal I think. The white snails are two and always there, they do not move at all. "
9759,"then charged more for actual exam to cover the lights and water a doc's student loans Hah! I've thought of that as well. Too bad insurance companies put a hard cap on how much you can charge for an exam. If your doctor charged $300 for the exam, the insurance would make the patient pay a $10 copay, then the insurance would pay the doctor $25 (but of course they tell the patient they covered the exam). Most of the money we get when a patient comes to get an eye exam comes from the sale of glasses (but even that is heavily capped by insurance companies most of the time). So you can see how that would add even more frustration when someone comes to you for troubleshooting problems for an outside Rx. Vision insurance companies *generally* screw us over royally. We could heavily discount our products and services if you paid straight cash and make more than what insurance pays (except that's contractually not allowed and could get us audited, which again, is another way we're forced to do things the way we do things, which hurts uninsured patients). "
9760,"Great, I have a bad eye vision of about 20/70ish. What vision can i achieve with Zenlens? "
9761,Your vision is likely just blurry from the abrasion still. It would be very uncommon to have scarring from an abrasion 48 hours after it happened. Think of it like this: if you cut your finger two days ago would you expect that it would still be healing or would you expect it to have scarred a lot already? Scars just don't form that quickly. 
9762,Unfortunately there isn't much you can do but have another surgery to remove it. I struggled with chalazions and blepharitis for 11 years and I have tried literally everything. I have a small chalazion on my lid margin now and have just learned to accept it is there now and apart from using a heated eye wand there isn't much else I can do. I did have a steroid injection for it but it didn't help much. I'm just going to give it time as sometimes you have to let your body heal it for you. If it's bad then get another surgery done but I found that everytime I had surgery another new chalazion would form! Good luck and if you Google heated eye wand there are tools that can directly heat the cyst to 42 degrees and above which is the temperature that the oils in the mg need to reach to then after massage the lid to almost express the oil out. 
9763,"Age: 38 Symptom: red eye, swollen lower eyelid. Right eye. No blurry vision, no pain, no itching other than discomfort from swelling. Right eye has small chalazion in the inside lower eyelid from a sty 6 months ago. Optometrist said it's too small to have it punctured, asked to just to hot compress and eyelid hygiene. One day, woke up with whole lower eyelid swollen (very red and puffy), and white part of eye very red. No pain and no discharge. After one day with no improvement, started doing hot compress with an eye mask, several times per day (like 10 times during the day) and also cleaning eyelids 2-3 times per day. It has been already 5th day with this condition. Eye is still very red, but eyelid is a little less swollen. For the past two days, noticed some sticky crystal yellow discharge in the morning. Sometimes when checking inside the eyelid, there is very little light green discharge coming out of the chalazion, cleaned with a swab. It's very light green, and very little. Most noticeable is crystal yellow in the morning (near the nose). Would it be conjunctivitis that allocated in the chalazion? Would it be bacterial or viral? This is the 5th day, and the other eye is fine. If it was viral or allergic, I believe at this point the other eye would have been infected too (unless it takes many days to flare-up). "
9764,"A monofocal IOL will only give you one ""distance"". To simplify, there is far distance which is beyond 20feet, intermediate or computer distance, and near which is your reading distance. It seems like you were set for far distance with your specific IOL. Astigmatism will cause your vision to be fuzzy. Toric lenses can help accommodate or correct this to give you the sharpest possible vision, but nothing is ever 100%. Before the surgery your cataract probably made you nearsighted giving you that ability to read up close. LASIK is precise and is dependent on the thickness of your cornea and your prescription. It would also be an easier option instead of asking your surgeon to go back in there and exchange your lens. Toric lenses are also more complicated as if they rotate, they would need to be surgically fixed again and repositioned. If you do decide to proceed with LASIK, understand that you can have sharp DISTANCE vision. But you will need reading glasses. This is just the way our body works. We lose near sight as we age. You can also do it opposite, set your eye to see up close, but you'll need to use glasses for distance. "
9765,"21, about almost 2 years ago. "
9766,"Are you in your 40s? Or close to it? Your most lonely hitting something called presbyopia. Aka time for reading glasses or bifocals, yay!!!! What attributed to this is simply aging, not the glasses. However it may seem that the prescription got stronger therefore you can't read with them unlike before. Dr. Q. "
9767,"Some additional info on my situation: - 26F, 5'6, 160lbs - originally from Western European country, now live in the US for work - severe myopia (-15 on right eye, -13 on left eye, negligible amount of astigmatism on both eyes) - started wearing glasses at 5, moved to contacts at 16, at 20 became unable to tolerate all contacts so switched back to glasses, at 23 I was given intra-ocular lenses to correct my nearsightedness - now I'm left with a little bit of refractive error (20/25 on right eye, 20/40 on left eye), but I don't wear glasses. I also have occasional starburst/halos in low light conditions (due to the lenses) - I go to the ophthalmologist every year for a comprehensive check up. Last time I went, everything was fine and stable. In the doctor's words ""my retinas are super resistant and solid""<U+009D>, even for my level of myopia. Yesterday I was out for a walk when I suddenly noticed a wash of floaters (like a wave of tiny dots) come over my right eye. A half an hour later I saw a huge, very dark cobweb floater form ""right before my eyes""<U+009D> - it was like something was squirting black ink into my eye. I knew that these could be early signs for retinal issues so I went to the ER immediately. They checked my eye pressure (22, 23), dilated my pupils, did all the usual tests and everything checked out. ER doctor did an ultrasound over my eyes: my left eye was fine but my right eye was, per his words, ""a little concerning""<U+009D>. He was undecided between PVD or RD. They had the ophthalmologist on call come check out what was happening. ER doctor did two types of tests using the light and the lens to look into the retina (one with the large thing where you put your chin against it, the other one she had a light on her forehead and was using a large lens and having me look in all sorts of directions. According to her, my retina looked smooth and perfect (no holes, tears or detachments) but she could indeed see the PVD as well as the floaters. She told me that PVD would likely be benign and likely brought on so early by my high myopia and my history of ocular surgery. Because the PVD was still ""in progress""<U+009D>, she advised me to stay alert to any change in my condition (such as very intense flashes and a curtain over my eyes), as that could mean a RD. She also told me that eventually a similar thing could happen to my left eye within a year or so. We booked a follow up appointment for December 16 to see if any additional issues could come up until then. My eyes are currently still very dilated from pupil drops (my eyes are very light blue, doctor said they were very responsive to th drops so they could take a while to go back to normal) I'm now left with a few questions that I didn't manage to get answers to because the doctor left so quickly afterwards: - are there any special precautions I should take in the next few weeeks to make sure I don't get a retinal detachment? - I run and swim for sport. Should I stop either of them? Or both? - are there any other activities that I absolutely should not engage on? - I have a trip to NY scheduled between December 4 and 8. Should I cancel all current travel plans? - she mentioned that once the PVD is complete it will actually be less likely that I get an RD (unless caused by trauma). Is this true? - are there any lifelong repercussions of PVD? - the floaters I'm having right now are unlike any others I've ever had. Will these go away ever? - I'm considering asking my PCP for some short term anxiety medication. Could these interfere at all? As in cause further problems? - the whole ER context was so stressful and nerve wrecking. I'm nervous the doctor may have missed something. Should I look for a second opinion? Thank you! "
9768,"Haha totally OK to fuss abt it no worries. Usually there is no way of tracking how fast the cataract can progress. If it truly is congenital, you only noticed it after 26 years! Typically blunt force trauma can cause cataracts, however i doubt your baby had enough strength to do that sort of damage. We only see it in more severe cases, I.e someone getting socked in the eye. There are some variations of cataracts that we can tell the difference between during an examination, however I still think that perhaps you can maintain your yearly visit. There really is nothing to worry about. Cataract surgery is the bread and butter of a lot of specialist. It has now become a v simple 15min procedure with a 95% success rate. "
9769,Yea I was diagnosed with it when I was 13 but when I started looking into treatments for it my left eye was already to thin for cxl and I think infacts wouldn't have helped my eye much but I should have looked into it more. If you don't mind me asking what was your vision like uncorrected and corrected before your surgery? 
9770,"I got diagnosed at like 15, had the cross linking (CXL) surgery at about 16, and i haven't had any further deterioration since, im now 21. Get to a good eye doctor quick, and in most cases if your careful you'll be fine. This wont improve your vision, but itll stop it getting worse, which if youve made it this far is probably ok. Thinks to improve vision is a much more complicated issue that i dont know enough to comment on. About the headaches, they fucking suck, but they can be mannaged. I get them when ive not been sleeping well, and im reading a lot. Sit in the dark for a bit and listen to something, maybe hold something cold on your eyes and youll feel much better. Good luck dude! "
9771,"Thats USA exclusive I think. OP didnt state their country. Regardless, you still dont want people using Lumify without advice, the skin problems it causes 5 or so years down the line need to be discussed with a GP or optometrist first. Since I have ketatoconus, I just put up with the skin effects (ive used it for 15 years); but i recently switched to pilocarpine because i was sick of 'peeling' the skin around my eyes, haha. https://pubmed. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/14578562/ Plenty of good studies on it; but you do need a ""backup"" drug, when you develop a slight allergy (latest studies suggest its a ""when"" not ""if"" scenario). "
9772,"Hmmm... I just asked for them straight up. The Dr said, ""you can try temporaries (again) or get permanent plugs."" I didn't hesitate to ask for permanent plugs knowing how well the temps worked 20 years earlier. I would think knowing your autoimmune history, the Dr would be falling over him/herself to get you into them in order to help relieve your eyes issues. "
9773,I'm 66 years old and been battling KC since l was diagnosed at twenty eight years old. I have raised this question to my cornea specialist as well as when a full eye transplant if the eye would be possible. It certainly won't be in my life time. As to the sclera lenses they are a blessing verses vas's permeable lenses. 
9774,"I'm 30. No major non-visual symptoms. Insomnia, fatigue, and anxiety. Also, thank you for your input. "
9775,The conversion for 584 is -3 and 588 is -3. Your true pressures are then respectably 19 (-3) and 22 (-3) So therefore your pressures are actually 16 and 19. Nothing wrong here. Theyre normal. 
9776,"I have known about my bad eye since I was 4 years old. I am 25 now. I get my eyes checked yearly but haven't worn prescription lenses since I was 13. I have been told by two different optometrists that it wasn't worth wearing prescription lenses, but rather I should wear glasses to protect my good eye. I'm unsure of the prescription I should have. My right eye is near sighted and can only see the E on the eye chart (2/200?). My left eye has near perfect vision but is far sighted. Prescription lenses show no improvement in vision for right eye. I used to get headaches the optometrist said were from the very uneven prescription lenses I wore. Now that it's been 12 years since I wore prescription lenses, I'm fighting recurrent painful headaches behind my right eye. The eye is pretty much useless, it goes black as far as I can tell if my good eye is open. Is it normal for my bad eye to degenerate to no vision? Could this be the cause of my headaches and is there treatment options I should seek out? I just learned this term so it might not be correct. Thanks in advance. "
9777,"Hi everyone. I'm 19 and have had worsening myopia over the years. I first discovered it at the end of 2015. However, in 2018, for the first time my optometrist said I have sudden strabismus and I went to a specialist. He didn't find any significant issue. Then for my eye exam last year, the strabismus totally resolved, but my optometrist noticed new slight astigmatism. Now I've myself noticed the strabismus returning. Is it possible that strabismus and astigmatism are linked? Also, can ortho k lenses fix all of this? "
9778,Same here. I go to bed at 10 or 11pm and am up at 4am. Even if I have a few drinks it doesn't help. Sometimes I then fall asleep at 5am but it late since work starts at 8 am. 
9779,"It's right up there with fatigue and muscle weakness for me. I used to be pretty sharp mentally, but now I struggle with focus, concentration, critical thinking, and memory. My brain just feels frozen at times, and I assume it's what people with dementia or Alzheimer's feel like in the early stages. I'm actually relieved that I under-achieved in life and didn't end up in a career requiring higher education or intense cognition. I can't learn well or perform brain intensive work most days. It's really frustrating. I'm 38 and I feel like my brain is going on 75. "
9780,"I'm not sure if this advice is current (they were planning on changing part 3 from grading on how you perform the skills to include a greater emphasis on disease management/clinical decision making). The hardest part is the script. You aren't supposed to say everything you are doing out loud in real clinic, and so having to change the good clinical habits you have is hard! I wrote out a script and practiced with it and memorized it. Stating findings or what you are doing is a good amount of points, if I remember correctly there's at least a point for each skill to state your finding. This is the part they want to get away from (ie anyone can memorize a script), but if that's still the structure when you take boards that's the test. Voicing everything you are doing and examining (even if your view isn't perfect) will get you points. Second I would highly recommend what Kimeako already suggested. Practice! They have a check list of what you're supposed to do, so it in that order so it's easy for them to grade you. This is the only test in which they give you all the questions and answers. Know exactly what is going to be on the test because undoubtedly there will be someone during your test time that doesn't. On the day of the test there is a practice area that you can use before the exam. I think I showed each of the other students that day how to perform a task or focus an instrument (it sure did boost my confidence!). Our school had practice lanes with the same equipment as they do in the testing center that was really helpful. they can give you a standardized pt that might be more of a challenge than a classmate, but by the time you take it you will have 9 months of clinical experience under your belt. I started practicing about 1 month beforehand I think during my final semester. I missed about 18 points out of the possible 1000 ish. Make a script it works. "
9781,"Hi all. I'm a 32 f and I've been having a variety of eye and neurological issues (mostly left sided) for a little over a year. I had an MRI last year in March and it was normal. At the time my vision ailments were an onset of blurry vision, jumping/shaky vision, what may be nystagmus (have video but my eye docs and neurologist haven't said for sure what it is), double vision, and temporary loss of peripheral vision. A month and a half ago (around New Years) I started seeing something out of the corner of my left eye. Nothing was ever there. Then I noticed it's almost like a blurry spot. It seems like my mind would kind of ignore it most of the time and it was more obvious in low lights. I went to my optometrist a month ago and they did a full exam but seen nothing. I'm awaiting an appt with a neuro ophthalmologist as referred to by my neuro as well as my eye doctor. I went to the ER today because the blurry spot is starting to progress further into my vision. It is still not in my line of sight but getting closer and I see it all the time now. It's more obvious when going from brightly lit room/ outside to a dimmer or dark room. The ER has referred me to a regular ophthalmologist this week as they didn't have anyone available to see me today. What is an ophthalmologist going to see that my optometrist couldn't? Will they have different equipment that can see further in my eye? Is there any important questions I should be asking aside from ""how come it's blurry on the side?""<U+009D>. "
9782,"There is no proven answer on what causes KC. There are a few hypotheses with some data to support them. But KC is such an unpredictable disease that it is hard to establish anything about it with certainty. Even though you may think you have no family history, people do find out that someone in their family did have KC but never said anything about it. Also it is only in the past 30 or so years that it has become fairly easy to diagnose KC. In the past many cases of KC were probably undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, especially if they were mild. With eye rubbing, a lot of KC sufferers do have a history of aggressive eye rubbing. But there are people with KC who have not rubbed their eyes much. And there are a lot of people who rub their eyes aggressively who do not have KC. So it is hard to know what to make of it. In my non-medical opinion, the advice for KC patients not to rub their eyes is one of those it can't hurt and it might help types of things. Curiosity about why you have KC is natural. Just don't get obsessed with the question because you won't get a clear answer and it doesn't matter as far as managing your KC. "
9783,"It's not diagnosed yet but my RA doc seems to think it's a possibility. I have loads of tests to do- but wanted to check in and read what other people deal with while having this condition. A few questions- how long did it take you to get your diagnosis? Was there any conditions that accompanied your SS? Also, is anyone here in there 20s? For some reason I keep getting conditions that are meant for 60 year olds lol. Would love to hear stories again and any general advice or feelings!! "
9784,"Sometimes it kicks in. Got diagnosed 2 years ago when I was 24 yo and had just started training to become a pilot. It's been my passion since forever and it can be depressing learning you can't do the one thing you feel you were born to do but as other have said, there're people dealing with worse diseases. Therefore, I try to be grateful and focus on my blessings instead. "
9785,"Hi experts, I always had great vision and never needed glasses until I was 16, but ever since then, my eyes have both become consistently more myopic by about a dioptre every year or two to the point where I'm now 25 and am sitting on -6.00D. I've only ever had about a -0.5D astigmatism in each eye and that's been unchanged the entire time. My optometrist tells me that there doesn't seem to be any obvious pathology and that it's purely refractive. They used to say it'd slow after I hit about 20 but it never has. I use computers and other screens but not extensively - no more than an average student. Just wondering how common it is to see deteriorations like mine, and if it's likely to ever slow. I'd love to get laser eye surgery one day but it's not looking likely if I keep going the way I am! Thanks for your thoughts! "
9786,"Hi everyone. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for from this post to be honest. Perhaps you could tell me what you would tell your patient who's just been diagnosed at age 35 with full fields and pressures are now under control, but is still completely consumed with the fear of blindness. Having this and knowing it's lifelong is a monkey on my back. Anytime I feel happy about anything, my mind immediately goes to, 'yeah, but you most likely will be blind by the time you're 80'. I've been told by my glaucoma specialist that my chances of blindness are low. My optometrist says I'm going to be fine, I've had many of you wonderful doctors tell me the same thing, but still here I am fearful each and every single day. I feel like I wouldn't be so fearful if a definitive neuroprotector was going to be available in the next 10-15 years. Or vision restoration in the next 20 years or so. I know there's been great progress in this area, but a breakthrough has yet to come. Any insight at all? A different perspective? What would you tell me if I was your patient? This has done a real number on my mental health.... and likely physical health too. TIA :). "
9787,Basically he says my right nerve is stressed and that is an early sign for glaucoma? He was asking if anyone in my family has glaucoma. I'm a 26 year old man and my vision is very important to me because im a pilot. I have a follow up appointment for him to do more tests. 
9788,"I'm a fellow 23 year old with KC. I was diagnosed back when I was 18. The first thing my doctor did was get me scleral lenses because my astigmatism was so bad in both eyes that I couldn't wear soft contacts or use glasses. I have also had crosslinking which is a procedure done to stop/slow the worsening of KC. I would definitely talk to your eye doctor about it. I personally have had great results, where I haven't had to get a new contacts prescription for the past couple of years. I live in the US and when I got crosslinking done my doctor was able to convince my insurance that it was medically necessary so if you have any problems with insurance be sure to talk to your doctor about that as well. "
9789,"Thank you, the information is screenshot worthy. I have been to the eye clinic where my opthalmologist suggested to get cross-linking done on Monday. But I'm not mentally prepared for it and he only took the penta-cam scan of my eyes once (in April, probably he'll have one more scan with this appointment). And another appointment after a week. I'm worrying because I live alone and if I postpone this treatment I might not get the treatment done for more than two months (doctors are avoiding patients cuz of COVID-19). I'm wondering if I can manage it by my self after the treatment... "
9790,"Your symptoms and presentation do seem to sound like contact lens intolerance. If you have any dry eyes or ocular allergies, wearing contacts can exacerbate those conditions. In the photos you've provided, your eyes look very inflamed. I wouldn't be surprised if you've had several flare ups of subepithelial infiltrates or corneal ulcers. I wear SofLens Toric For Astigmatism. These contact lenses have very poor oxygen permeability. Combine that with your higher Rx, your eyes are likely getting insufficient oxygen. Have been wearing contacts for about 20 years. Only had maybe 2 or 3 eye infections the whole time. Contact lens intolerance usually takes years/decades to occur. Having *any* eye infections during this time is a sign that you should be switching to daily disposable contact lenses. First thing I would suggest is going back to your optometrist to see if you have any dry eyes, meibomian gland dysfunction, ocular allergies, papillary conjunctivitis or eye inflammation that needs to be treated. Then it's time to switch to a more oxygen permeable daily disposable contact lens. If you've truly developed an intolerance to contact lenses, I'd even consider refractive surgery (IF your dry eyes are under control). "
9791,"Hello, I recently went to visit a new optometrist, and there was a discussion about atropine as an upcoming treatment to slow progression of myopia. First of all, I am very upset that I am approaching my mid 30s and my vision is still changing, not rapidly, but progressively. I'm not sure how I could stop it. I am on the computer a lot. My optometrist told me that there are studies out on use of atropine to slow progression but it is not yet FDA approved, and if so, it may be expensive. He is following the research. Do you all have any thoughts on slowing progression, or on Atropine as an upcoming drug? "
9792,"I think you'll have to weigh both sides. General anaesthesia is generally safe but has greater side effects than local so there's that slight risk. However, since he's so young and already feeling anxious, he may feel overwhelmed during the procedure. I am in my 20s and I found it difficult to deal with. Also you need to follow instructions while they are doing it. My doctor kept telling me to not move my head and to keep looking directly at the light, to keep both my eyes open as I would try to close my eyes instinctively and I found this even harder to do while feeling anxious. It seemed like the longest 40 mins of my life. So this is also something to consider since anxiety can interfere with the procedure. A lot of people have reported not having any issues with it but I think the experience varies from person to person. Your doctor should decide what suits your nephew best after discussing it with you guys. I would definitely suggest the calming stuff if you decide to not do it with GA. I am not in pain anymore, thankfully. It's only really bad the first day and gets better really quickly in the next couple of days. With epi off they put a bandage contact lens in the eye so the eye heals nicely in the coming week or so. I didn't need to take pain killers after the first day and by now I'm only feel a little discomfort now and then. Vision definitely gets worse at first though but it improves gradually, I'm told. Given how successful the procedure is generally said to be, it's def worth it! "
9793,"""Normal"" is relative to the population, not necessarily your body. Some people can have a pressure of 24 and have no glaucomatous damage, while others can have pressures consistently in the teens and still progress. There are a lot of variables and risk factors at play, which is one of the reasons it can be such a hard disease to diagnose in the early stages. "
9794,"Hey y'all! I'm 27F who has had symptoms creeping up since high school, and I am waiting for some test results, hoping I have an official diagnosis or some answers. In the meantime, it's stressing my husband (and I) out to have me go through this and the possibility that if I have Sjogren's, my symptoms will be sticking around. I'm wondering if you have any tips or advice on helping your spouse through the Sjogren's process. I got to a low point one day and told him that because I loved him so much I would let him leave me so he didn't have to deal with my health issues anymore. Luckily for me, he isn't an asshole, and he said he is here to stay in sickness and in health.

9799,"So you guys, I've been suffering for the past week with an absolute mystery eye problem. The story starts on Tuesday night of last week, I was crying, and wiped my eyes with a used microfiber makeup wipe that was a few days old (probably not my best choice.) I tried to get all my makeup off before I went to bed, but I was feeling down and lazy so there was still some left when I hit the hay. This has never been an issue for me or caused the issue I'm having, I've gone to bed with makeup more than a few times in my life even though its not recommended. Anyway, I woke up Wednesday morning with swollen eyelids and EXTREMELY itchy eyes, and a little redness. I did cold compresses, warm seasalt compresses, and antihistamine and regular eyedrops for a couple days. Little to no improvement. Friday comes and my eyes still feel like crap so I go to the eye doctor. That morning my eyes were less swollen, but I have almond shaped eyes and barely a lid so it's hard to even tel if they're swollen unless you see me every day. Anyway, he did a full eye exam, and said my eyes looked fine. I was worried about having blepharitis or something, and he specifically said he saw NO blepharitis. He told me he thought I maybe had an allergic reaction to the makeup getting in my eye from crying, and prescribed me a anti-inflammatory eye drop. Other than that he was kind of dismissive because my eyes looked ""fine"". So I start using the eyedrops, and although they feel good and get rid of the itchiness, my eyes are still red and irritated. Saturday I went to urgent care, and they prescribed me antibiotics. I've been taking those both and they seemed to help A LOT. My eye issue seemed to have gone away by Sunday morning - and it was my daughter's birthday party. I know this is kind of dumb but I did put on a clean new pair of false eyelashes (with no other eye makeup) because I was seeing a bunch of people and I literally never ever go without makeup, its embarrassing to me. That was fine. I cleaned my eyes and used drops before and after. Everything was okay. I took them off as soon as the party ended and woke up Monday with clear eyes, seemingly back to normal. So at this point I figured I was good. I continued to clean my eyes and use the drops and went grocery shopping with a little makeup on last night. Nothing burned, itched, or bothered me. I will say I haven't replaced my makeup yet from possibly having an infection, but I've cleaned my brushes and sprayed everything with alcohol. I have makeup to replace it with, but id figure id do it after like a week of no symptoms. I didn't think I could get reinfected with an eye infection (if I even have one?) If I'm still using the antibiotics. Anyway, woke up this morning... swollen eyelids again. Slight itchiness. Wtf? I really hope I don't have blepharitis that the eye doctor missed? Is that possible? I've been religiously taking the antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drops, removed all my makeup last night, cleaned my eyes, etc. TDLR; Woke up with swollen eyes the morning after crying and getting makeup in my eyes. Treated it myself with compresses and various kinds of OTC eyedrops for days with little progress. Saw eye doctor, he gave me anti-inflammatory eyedrops. Those helped the symptoms but seemingly not the cause. Went to urgent care and got antibiotics drops. Been taking them both with lots of improvement, basically back to normal. Wore false eyelashes Sunday for an event - was very clean about it - no issues. Continues to use the treatments. Then I wore a tiny bit of eyeshadow with clean brushes and (brand new) lashes again yesterday, took if off and cleaned before and after. Woke up this morning with puffy lids again even though I'm on antibiotics still. So basically my questions are: 1. If I'm allergic to my makeup and its causing this like the eye doctor suggested, why would this only happen after I cried Tuesday night? I've been using the same brand makeup for 10 years. 2. If its an infection would it really clear up completely and get worse just from a tiny bit of makeup even though I'm still on antibiotics? I was really careful and again, cleaned my brushes. I only put on eyeshadow and false lashes. I was not wearing false lashes for days when this reaction first started, so I know its not those. 3. Could the doc have missed blepharitis? I just am severely worried about my symptoms. Especially the swollen eyelids. I don't see any crusting, yellow oozing, etc., though... EDIT: I'd also like to mention, my right eye has been more symptomatic this whole time than my left, but now this morning my left eye is a bit worse than my right. (Swelling and itchiness-wise.) Those are really the only symptoms I'm having... redness, swelling, itchiness and the occasional feeling like something is in my eye. No discharge. "
9800,"I (35m) was diagnosed with keratoconus about ten years ago when I was in my mid-twenties. At the time I was still practically homeless and dealing with a lot of issues around being queer and being rejected/kicked-out by my family at age 16. It's taken me a very long time to get my life on track and get to a place where I can start to look after myself. I can tell my eye sight is deteriorating rapidly and I am wondering what the future will hold for me. My keratoconus is considered very bad, I cannot get any meaningful correction with glasses anymore and for the last two years have stopped wearing them altogether. My right eye is totally blurred, my left eye is better. My husband does all my banking and form filling for me because I find it very difficult. I've always considered my lifestyle incompatible with the contact lenses because I live in a very remote farmstead and I'm always dirty, working with animals, sleeping out, sweating, swimming etc... But maybe that's a misconception? Whats the minimum care required to try the contacts? Do you wash them? Do you have to take them out every day? I've heard about the cross-linking but I was under the impression that it only worked if you caught it early to preserve the eye sight you have left. I could probably go to the nearest city and get cross-linking very easily but is it worth it? What could it achieve for me? Lastly, have I left it too late to do anything? What will happen if I do nothing? Will I eventually go blind? Are there any other treatments out there? Thanks for reading everyone, have a great day! "
9801,Prescribing prism can be tricky. Try to aim for the least amount of prism that allows the patient to see comfortably. In your case it might just be 13 BO. It's too bad the patient has already had cataract surgery in both eyes - it could have been the perfect time to perform monovision cataract surgery (if the patient could tolerate it with contacts beforehand). 
9802,I am 25 and have recently developed a few eye floaters that have made me hyper aware of my vision. I am just wondering if after images that last from 10-20 seconds after looking at bright lights or the sun glinting off cars are normal? I have been noticing them often after the floaters developed. 
9803,Hey I'm 26 and I just got 2 cornea transplants in both my eyes as I was at the end stage of kerataconus. I left it too late to fix. The transplants are the greatest thing that I could've done. It has changed my life. 
9804,"I can see quite severe white light flashes in my peripheral vision in only one eye. They become worse with eye movement. They are always in the same places. I am 22 with no underlying conditions. I went to a neuro-opthalmologist a few days ago and they did not see any issues with my eyes and retina, apart from being near-sighted (-1.00 in both eyes). Any idea what this could be? Should I just wait and hope the flashes subside or seek the opinion of another doctor? "
9805,"People get used to seeing terribly, especially when it's gradual. Lots of myopes, especially kids, come in for their routine test saying they're asymptomatic and their vision is fine. Last year they maybe saw 6/6, this time you turn on the chart and they're seeing 6/12 and need more minus on top. A similar thing happens here I think. Because they reduce it so gradually they don't realise their VA is reducing (or they do and they're in denial). One patient I saw had been doing this herself with specs bought online over a period of 18 months. The previous optom told her it wouldn't work and she came in to show us it had. Turned on the chart and she was seeing 6/18+. I politely advised her she wasn't even seeing well enough to drive with her current specs and she stormed out calling us con artists who just wanted to make her eyesight worse. *Sorry for the UK terms...6/6 is 20/20 in US terms. 6/12 would be 20/40 I guess and 6/18 must be 20/60.

9806,"And also, I know where I messed up 20 years ago. I was young and stupid and I slept in my lenses because the doc at the big box stores told me it was safe as long as I took them out for one day every week. And I abused that as well, I didn't always take them out, and if I'm honest probably didn't take them out once a month. So I absolutely know what I done wrong then and would have probably done more damage had I not went to a doc that had an open appt the day I needed it. She told me how bad it was and honestly have me a good chewing out. Asked me if I had my eyes dilated at last exam and I told her no, they told me I didn't have to. She let me know the seriousness of it then, and I started taking care of my eyes more then. No other doctor ever gave me the option to not have dialation, but I knew I would always have it from that point forward anyway. But this time, I just can't figure out what I done wrong. Sorry for the novel lol. "

9811,"Hello, I am 22 years old, female, and recently started to have problems with my left eye. It started at the beginning of July this year, I suddenly got problems with the visual field of my left eye. I was still able to see everything but the periphery of my left eye is darkened, kind of like this: [Initial problems, darkened periphery](https://preview.redd.it/gmqv0m2kdpu51. jpg? width=1197&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a084776a9ce2646a1ce35a3c7fae4c862a9f9333) Soon I went to the doctor, he diagnosed an acute posterior vitreous detachment. The intraocular pressure was 21,5 mmHg for my left eye, whereas it was 16,7 mmHg for my right eye. He also took an OCT scan (see pictures), where he diagnosed a thinning of the retina, and fundoscopy scans (see pictures), where he diagnosed a cobblestone degeneration. [OCT 1](https://preview.redd.it/s8bvxazjtsu51. width=1700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81d2ef705b8751bc7fff6c52e149e3c4b6b1bb3e) [OCT 2](https://preview.redd.it/wo0z2d1ltsu51. width=1700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c4b2ea0cc73f200bc818754b1f98514abffddfc) [Fundoscopy scan 1](https://preview.redd.it/zw0c5cprdpu51. width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c821e34e052f90d96bd3fef6c7f83f50ff97a0db) [Fundoscopy scan 2](https://preview.redd.it/vl7djdprdpu51. width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ca92704a0176ea8f96bfbeab503c3636ec0fc55) [Fundoscopy scan 3](https://preview.redd.it/irzsxfprdpu51. width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb19e5d52c161106ccbcb2ae12e285332882b9fc) [Fundoscopy scan 4](https://preview.redd.it/syimejprdpu51. width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=203971671659b5d0ac25e73650218d76d6a4aa49) The doctor also did the following other tests, which were all fine: ultrasound, visual acuity (100 %), visual field test, Amsler grid test. Since then, I started regularly take 125mg Anthocyane (once a day), 120 mg Gingko Biloba (once a day), and 20 mg Lutein (every second day). In the following time, the intensity of the problems was varying, I have even had 2-3 weeks end of September, and at the beginning of October where I felt like I had no problems at all. Now, however, it all got worse. I feel like there is a completely missing part of the visual field, illustrated in the image below: [Problems now, can't see at the very left](https://preview.redd.it/hrybnfjydpu51. width=1210&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=249a2a36c05f018fef157ce1ad01d097b2278abc) Furthermore, there is a numb feeling for over a week in the lateral part of the left eye. Occasionally, there is also a pressure/burning sensation in the left eye, especially in the evenings. Only on one day, it was strangely gone and I was able to see without any restrictions, but on most days, I have these problems. I suspect that my general problem is the higher left eye pressure. My questions are three-fold: First, what could be the cause for my problems and what could be a possible treatment? Second, is it normal that it can vary and get worse or better quickly? Third, should I go to an ophthalmologist to get another OCT or visual field test, or should I go to a Neurologist to check the optical nerve? I will go to a doctor soon, but hope to get some more perspectives on Reddit. Here is some further background information: * My father has glaucoma * Both of my grandmothers have a cataract and a macular degeneration/AMD (but only at a high age) * My only other medication is a contraceptive pill Thank you very much in advance!

9812,I've been having eye pressure in my left eye and my vision feels slightly out of focus but not necessarily blurry. My doctor thought it was from these prednisolone drops but I stopped using them a little over a month ago. I never had eye problems before besides just needing glasses and contacts. So I'm not sure what this could be. Could it be a sinus problem or something then? I heard if my eye pressure is 20/25 I wouldn't feel anything unless the pressure was higher like 40 or something. But I definitely can feel something and I'm not sure if it's dry eye then but it's not painful though it just feels abnormal. I'm only 27 too. 
9813,I got the Oasys daily wear ones and toss them at night and I've been wearing contacts for about 26 years. I've always taken them out at night and cleaned when I used to have the yearly ones then the monthly ones etc and only had issues a couple of times both when I managed to scratch my eye during sleep or my kid hit my eye and scratched it. I've always had glasses as spares to wear when I wake up or take a flight but other than that I've worn contacts daily since 1995 ðŸ˜€ If you're comfortable wearing them go for it! usually put in my contacts at 9am and take out at 10pm. efore with my old schedule I put them in at 6am and took them out at 10pm. o issues. 
9814,Great that it is working for you. I would say don't necessarily expect it to work for you ongoing and never have to do it again. I have done Lipiflow with BlephEx treatment 3x in the last 5 years. I am also going for IPL in a couple of weeks. I also am looking into meibomian gland probing next. That said it all depends on one's individual situation. I am in my 70s and my dry eye is age-related. Yours maybe not. 
9815,"I completely agree. I would like to add that if you do the upgaze test and it is negative, that does not necessarily mean you do not have myesthenia gravis. So, you need to be seen by an ophthalmologist regardless. Also, there is a blood test to see if you have certain types of antibodies that can diagnose myesthenia gravis. I have seen many many patients over the past 35 years whose only sign of myesthenia was intermittent droopy eyelid and the only positive test was the blood test. There is also another test where a certain medicine is injected in your veins to see if the drooping goes away. Doctors often don't do that test and just prescribe a drug (Mestanon) to see if it goes away and they do this instead of the IV test. The disease is treatable but as mentioned can ""spread"" to other parts of the body, most notably breathing (so this can be very serious) but also other muscle weakness. A neuro-ophthalmolgist would be the best person to see but they often only see patients by referral so you might need to see a general ophthalmologist first. Do not underestimate the importance of being evaluated by an ophthalmolgist or neuro-ophthalmologist as soon as you can. "
9816,"I recently went to get an eye exam and on my results, it says I have a DPD OD of 63. My optometrist did not indicate what this was so I was wondering if someone could explain it to me? There is OS right next to the OD but there is no number there. Is this essentially the same thing as PD? If this is not the right place to ask, I'm sorry! "
9817,"Having been in tech for a looooooong time, it is funny how the fashion keeps flip flopping between light text on a dark background and dark text on a light background. (I actually predate the availability of video monitors.) Back in the bad old days of black and white CRT tube monitors with laughably low resolution we started with light text on a dark background because that was what was technically feasible. Then they advanced to being able to make a light background with dark characters and everybody liked that better because the text was solid black rather than a bunch of horizontal white stripes. (Bunch meaning something like 7 to 13 depending on the resolution of your screen.) Then we got color monitors and we went through the periods of hideous light colored text on hideous dark colored backgrounds and vice versa. Not to mention the periods of colored text on almost the same colored background. So while display technology improves, the taste and design sense of programmers does not. I also have a background in printing (like printing press ink on paper type printing). I am not sure what is more painful. Trying to read a computer screen with KC or having to look at a computer screen with typographic sensibilities. "

9821,"I'm glad you have good boyfriend. Support is KEY. I'm glad you are on here, too. Thank you for the offer. 22 is young, but maybe it is an opportunity to manage things well from the get-go. Maybe you can keep it in check because you are young? IDK how that works. I got my first autoimmune (hashimoto's) at 30. Celiac soon after. Some significant POTS and chronic fatigue. Multiple migraines per month. It took a while to figure what my body needs to live well. I didn't kick things into high gear until after Soeren's, unfortunately. I found a rheumatologist who urged me to do massive food modifications (autoimmune paleo for a while). He says he wished all his patients would do it but most just want pills because diet and lifestyle modification is a lot harder to do. He was thrilled when I said I would do it. It dropped my hashimoto's antibodies (aTPO) from over 1500 to under 600 in 12 weeks. Soeren's is a pain in the ass. I' m 50 now and do a lot of biohack-y stuff, dietary interventions, and functional medicine and have stayed free of the biologics. I also appear a lot younger than my peers at this point lol, because I don't carry extra weight and have not had alcohol or bad eating patterns in some years. POTS has resolved. So far my organs are clear, though eyes, ears, salivary glands are permanently damaged. I don't have Soeren's flares as often, and they are not severe like my initial ones were. Autoimmune disease is unfair, but it does provide us built-in opportunity for self care. We need not ever apologize for needing sleep, refusing to spend time on stupid things, etc. It allows me to prioritize and live life in a more deliberate manner. I don't waste time anymore for the most part. And I don't take things for granted. I still wish I didn't have it. It has impacted my ability to work full time and life with pain all the time sucks. But I am doing what I can do to keep it in check. "
9822,"Hello all, Fourth year student here. In speaking with my classmates I have spoken with a few students who passed TMOD on their part 2 boards on a standard scale with the cutoff for passing being a 75. Two students received 80s on a standard scale but where pushed back to a 74 due to the curving criteria? It seems like many students in this ball park where pushed back points. I don't quite understand why they have to curve a test like this. I feel like those in nbeo are just trying to make it harder to pass so they can generate more money via overpriced test fees. I'm sure they didn't have to deal with the nonsense on these exams when they where grinding their teeth while they where in school. "
9823,"In a practical sense it delays or reduces the need for presbyopia correction. Most patients who are myopic don't feel the need to wear glasses for reading after age 40. In fact, I find it difficult to convince most of them that wearing bifocals is more convenient than removing their glasses every time they want to read. From the typical myopic patient's perspective, they have no problems reading. They only need glasses for driving. From a technical perspective, myopia can actually delay the onset of presbyopia. I'm not going to go into the gritty details but since myopia correcting glasses don't actually correct vision but merely create a virtual object closer to the ***lenses*** (not the eyes) there is an overall reduce accommodative demand on bespectacled myopic patients from compared to normal eyes. If you draw careful diagrams or use complex equations you'll find that nearsighted people don't need quite as much accommodative power to see up close as everyone else, even while they are wearing glasses. The effect is small but this means with a high enough myopic prescription patients will notice a slightly lesser presbyopia symptoms, to the point that they may even be able to put off bifocals for a year or two compared to if they weren't myopic. This advantage is lost when wearing contact lenses because the lens is directly in front of the eye. This is admittedly a niche case and not something you will encounter often but it's possible for someone with a high enough myopia (-8.00 for example) to reach the age of 40 and feel like they suddenly need reading glasses while wearing contacts, but be able to read fine while wearing their single vision glasses. They are effectively presbyopic only while wearing contacts. The opposite is true of hypermetropic patients. That long last bit is not very practical but I think it's interesting. "
9824,"Hi everyone, I wanted to see if anyone had this case before or may be able to suggest something. I've 20/30 and 20/40 on my eyes without correction, so they are decent, just really bad ghosting (50 and 58 diopters). I've tried scleral lenses, RGPs, and hybrids, but none of them work effectively. They increase my visual acuity to 20/25 but the ghosting becomes sharper that it becomes harder to read. I then tried non-keratoconus hybrid lenses. These are much flatter than our corneas. My optometrist took a scan of my eye after 15 minutes and some of the hard part of the lens was sitting on the cornea (tight fit). But, my vision was perfect. Absolutely no ghosting. When I take the lenses off at the end of the day, it would make my vision worse than my non-corrected vision, and would take a couple of hours to return to normal. It seems like the tight lenses was changing my cornea shape temporarily. Due to fear, I stopped using the lenses, even though the optometrist said it should be okay if touches a little (we are talking about a maximum of 20 microns distance in the furthest area from the lens to the cornea, in other places its touching). I miss the perfect vision and knowing that I was able to get it makes me believe there is a solution. Is there anything anyone knows about this or can suggest? My ophthalmologist who did the CXL has been absent since this whole COVID situation. "

I put my right lens in the left eye. Then took another 20+ tries before the doc did it for me so he could get a measurement. Second appointment was today. Same story. First try, it goes in almost perfectly on the first try, but there's a bubble. Take it out and try again, and again, and again. Probably 15 tries before I got it this time. I don't know if I psyche myself out, after being calm and confident for the very first try. "

9831,"A little history, currently seeing a glaucoma specialist due to high pressures. He's run tests and says my corneas are thick so my pressures aren't quite as high as they are reading which puts them really close to normal (like 22-22 maybe). He says based on several sets of pictures and his exam that he is leaning towards me not having glaucoma, just high pressures but if he does decide that I will still need pictures done every six months to make sure glaucoma does not develop. My previous doctor (who diagnosed me with glaucoma after two regular eye exams for contact lens renewal) had put me on latanoprost, glaucoma specialist took me off the drops and I go back in April to see how my pressures are and to take another test he said he couldn't do with my eyes dialated. All this was in November. It is time for my contact lens renewal, so I went to a different regular eye doctor to get a new script since my glaucoma doctor does not do refractions. This new doctor said I had neovascularization (sp?) and severe dry eye (very shocking to me because I have no symptoms of the dry eye). I told her that I knew I had it years ago, but that I always ask about it and they say that (to the best of my understanding) the vessels had dried up. She was quick to say no, it's new. You need glasses with an updated prescription, bifocals, and they need to have sun protection because your eye pigment is light. She refused to give me a contact prescription and prescribed ketorolac 3x day for two weeks then once a day, along with rephresh drops twice a day and I go back in 3 weeks. The neo really shook me because I do not sleep in my lenses and I use dailies which is what I was told was the cause of my previous case 20 years ago. They threatened to never let me have contacts again, so I make sure to follow the rules, and it just surprised me because I haven't had any issues all this time, but it is what it is. I really hate glasses, so I am looking into options as I fear she will no longer allow me to stay in the current contacts (Soflens Dailies). I've tried the silicone lenses and could not tolerate them for longer than 3-4 hours due to them drying out and causing bumps under my eyelids, but I had not noticed dry eye in the soflens. I tried the rgp lenses before the soflens and I was able to tolerate them, but dropped one and realized the problems it would be if I lost one, so if I do decide on that route, I would want to make sure I had a spare lens just in case. I would love to try OrthoK, but my prescription is -7 and -7.25 so I don't think it would work based on the research I've done. I did find a place near me that does that, so I'm not ruling out talking to them in the future. Any suggestions other than rgp or the orthok? I saw where they now make a hybrid lens, but I think it is really expensive and I couldn't find anywhere near me that done that. Anyway any advice about contacts you can offer would be great. "
9832," I've found it either runs STRONGLY in the family or simply occurs randomly. See, this is why the confusion is there about if KCN is genetic or not, even in the field. In my case, neither of my parents or grandparents have KCN. All I know is that my great grandma went blind in her 20s. Could it have been KCN? I don't know. I wonder how it came up for me. My advice is have your excellent provider run topography every year through their teens and cross link if it ever shows up. Yep. Don't be /u/Upper_Comedian_1974 and not catch it early. :). "

9834,"Background: degenerative myopia, and diagnosed with post vitreous detachment (-18 rx in both eyes contacts) I got a new contact prescription about two months ago. I noticed yesterday that my while my close vision was decent, my distance vision has been rather wonky. My eyes go blurry when I am trying to see anything farther than about a foot in front of me. It takes a few seconds, they focus and then go blurry again. I can still make out my surroundings but faces and any reading at a distance doesn't really happen. I have been on the computer/tablet a lot because of classes and I have been wearing my glasses more to try and rest my eyes but I haven't seen any improvement in the last 24 hrs. Is it possible this is just a prescription change? The dr has also been monitoring me for macular degeneration ðŸ˜¬. And while I see a fuzzy film when I first look at the charts, it does go away in a few blinks. ut then it comes back when I retest the same eye. ny advice appreciated. "
9835,"It really is! I want to see if scleral lens will work for me but I can't reason with that price point. That process for the autologous drops doesn't seem all too bad, especially considering how much it's helped you. Is it something that is covered by insurance? I have not been diagnosed with Soeren's syndrome, just severe dry eyes (tears evaporate very quickly) and mild-moderate MGD and my ophthalmologist thinks there may be a ""neuropathic component."" I'm a 23 year old female so I'm not exactly sure why I've been dealing with such severe dry eyes but I wore contact lenses for about 9 years and went on Accutane in 2018 so maybe that's why. I also found out I have dust, mold, and pollen allergies so I've been taking sublingual immunotherapy drops from my doctor's office that are supposed to ""cure"" me from them but they are $145 a month so I'm really hoping that helps. I'm running low on options but it's good to hear the autologous drops work for you and that there are still more things to try. "

9837,"Now more frequently the optician has been having look through more and more blurry lenses to see what I can read even if its squinting to see what I can see ....... Don't squint or do anything unusual to try to read the eye chart. It is the lenses that are being tested, not you. You are scoring the exam of the lenses and a possible vision correction added to the lenses. Just call 'em like you see 'em... literally. This part of the fitting process is very important and relies very much on what you are telling the doctor. For people with normal eyes, they can pretty much just keep following the trail of what's getting better until going further gets worse and then backtrack to the best vision. When you have KC, it's not that simple. Vision can get better, then worse, then better again following a set of lenses in one direction. And the whole concept of better doesn't always make sense if you have KC. I like to rephrase the question as ""which do you prefer?"" And if I don't like either I say so. If I can, I try to describe what is wrong with what I am seeing. That can give the doctor some idea of what needs to be fixed. If you get good vision through the phoropter, without squinting or other contortions, and you don't get almost the same vision from the ordered lenses, then something is wrong. That is something your doctor should be trying to figure out. Sorry to be ageist, but at 25 years old it is unlikely your doctor has had time to gain much experience fitting KC patients. I know everyone has to start somewhere, but it sounds like they are in over their head. "
9838,"I posted yesterday after my appointment because I had absolutely no idea what was going on. Thanks to a very helpful poster, I am a little more knowledgeable, but alas, I have more questions for you super helpful people. For reference, I am a 33 y/o female with slight nearsightedness. As of yet, I have not noticed any loss of vision in my periphery. After seeing that I had a bit of loose pigment, my optometrist scheduled me for a follow up in November for further testing. He briefly mentioned the optic nerves, but didn't go into too much detail because the office was packed that day and I think he was a little frustrated at how hard it was for me to keep my eyes open during the dilated pupil test. He asked me if I ever get any headaches and I said I get light ones maybe every other week for 20 min, but I thought everybody did. (However, now that I'm kind of scared, I've started wondering if I've been ignoring headaches and have convinced myself that I maybe have had one all day.) I also had the standard air puff test and a couple of tests were I had to focus on a cross hair as something scanned(?) my eye and I had to focus on a picture of hot air balloon. Now that I've done the research and learned how serious nerve damage from glaucoma is, I've become quite a bit more anxious. How likely am I to accrue damage over the period of three months until my baseline test? I keep trying to assure myself that if it were something super serious, it would have been scheduled sooner. I've also been searching and reading online all day, but I'm the sort of person whose thoughts are drawn to the scariest possible outcome even though I try not to be. If I do schedule another exam for a second opinion, it would be at potentially great expense as my insurance isn't amazing and I'd have to travel quite a distance, but if there is an authentic threat to my eye health, I'd be willing to do it. Any advice, knowledge or reassurance would be amazing right now. Thank you all in advance. 3. "
9839,"Sounds like you need to find a new rheumatologist that will help you more. I would find someone that can sit down with you and work out a diet plan, not just to avoid triggers but to get essential nutrients that might be helpful. Look into helpful supplements like Omegas, joint supplements and VITAMIN D. You may also just be severe enough to need medication. Restasis, systaine drops, and therabreath mints are my favorite helpers. I have been on Restasis for years, with otc drops in between (remember: Restasis =healing, otc drops=moisture). About a year before diagnosis, I received lasik in one eye and it has been wonderful. I'm not sure if they would have done it after my diagnosis, but they did not act concerned that I was already on Restasis. They, in fact, said they often prescribe it post surgery. I've been symptomatic for about 10 years, and diagnosed just over two years ago, after my first born. I overhauled my diet and cut out all of the common culprits, including dairy, and started recommended supplements. My exhaustion, pain and dryness were fairly bad, until a few months ago. Turns out my diet changes were not sustainable, despite seeming very healthy and I developed a severe vitamin D deficiency that was causing most of my pain, insomnia, brain issues, etc. Once I addressed it, my overall health has greatly improved. I still have to watch out for carbs and the common triggers, and deal with dryness, but it's all very manageable. "

9844,"I got my first pair of glasses at age 6 for farsightedness, and wore them off and on until my mid 20s. I could always see fine up close and far away, but would get headaches from reading things close and was told to wear my glasses when reading or on the computer. The last exam that I had prior to today was in 2014 when I was 22. A few years ago, I started noticing that my night vision was a lot worse and lights, reflective road signs, etc were really blurry. And in the last year or 2, I've started noticing that things are blurry at a distance during the day as well. It feels like my eyes just aren't able to focus properly. I finally made an appointment and had an eye exam today and the doctor said that I have mild myopia, but that my eyes look healthy so that was good to hear! I'm just confused about why my eyes went from farsighted to nearsighted in the last few years and couldn't find much info on it online. Is this common? I asked the doctor and he didn't really have an explanation, I'm not sure if it's just because it's something that's so common that it doesn't really need a reason or if it's because he just thought that I was probably misremembering my old prescription. Hoping someone here could provide some insight! Not sure if it's relevant but my new prescription is: RT sphere -0.5, cylinder-.25, axis 040, LT sphere -0.75, cylinder -.25, axis 05. I don't have my old prescription for reference but I know that it was for farsightedness (was told to wear when reading or working on the computer and it made my distance vision worse). I'm probably overthinking it, but it's just been a bit unsettling to go from never having real vision issues to struggling to read road signs until they're really close and just having a lot more trouble seeing things clearly that aren't up close, and understanding the ""why behind it would help!

9846,So a few monthes ago I've been diagnosed with myopia in only my right eye and got prescribed glasses. One thing I've noticed is that the myopic eye sees slightly darker than the healthy eye. But it gets pretty noticeable when it's nighttime. I initially brushed it off as a side effect of myopia but I'm getting really concerned about it lately. My ophtalmologist checked my eyes 2 monthes ago and didn't find anything wrong with them. I'm scared it might be cataracts or something else serious but I'm only 22 :/.

It's kind of like when you accidentally get a fingerprint on your glasses, but it's all over. I noticed it shortly after putting my contacts in, so I took one out for a bit assuming it was the lens itself but realized I can't go about my day half-blind so I switched to glasses, and that's when I realized it was still happening. This has happened before, but always in both eyes and it normally tends to happen after a long day and is guaranteed to happen if I've been crying. It occasionally gets a little better, then gets a little worse again. I also have a vague pain right under my upper orbital bone. I also have more floaters in this eye than the other, which isn't really new but now I'm hyper aware of them. Could this be a retinal detachment? I have no warping, loss of field of view, or flashes, but my myopia makes me nervous. I know I should put my phone down and do non-screen things, and I have a LOT to do, but I'm down the google rabbit hole now. A bit about me: 35 y/o, female, myopic since age 7. Primarily a contact lens user since I was 16. Contacts are -8.00 in both eyes, glasses a tiny bit stronger. Under immense pressure right now because I'm in the middle of moving. I suffer from anxiety and ADHD as well as some mood disorder they can't pin down. I also haven't been to the eye doctor in an unusually long amount of time due to covid. When I finally got an appointment, they rescheduled me due to a recent patient coming up positive. Then *I* had to cancel due to a ~new and unusual~ sinus headache. Haven't rescheduled due to work; the wait is about a month but I only know my schedule 2-3 weeks out and my time off requests keep being denied. Lens stuff: I am absolutely useless with glasses due to barrel distortion and color separation around the edges, so I primarily wear contacts until 9-10pm. I wear two-week disposables, which lately I've been swapping out after around 10 days due to taking on a bit more computer work at my retail job. I also occasionally pass out super early (and out of nowhere) while watching TV with my contacts still in, but I usually manage to wake up and take them out. Please help calm my nerves!

9851,"\As for your analogy, I'm not sure it's applicable here ""<U+0080><U+009D> contact lenses don't need to fit all eyes, just yours. The point was towards abbe values more than lenses and more just that a lot of things aren't considered necessary to some people are to others. You might live in the inner city and only drive on roads that go up to 25 or 45 mph and not find exceeding that ""necessary"" cause a car that works but has a 50 mph limit is still a working car. But I make deliveries and use the freeway frequently I want to be able to go up to the speed limit whatever it is meaning I need a car that can at least go 70 to 80 mph. With abbe values I had a doctor tell me he didn't feel it was necessary and told me he didn't think I could actually tell the difference between the trivex lenses I wanted and the High index lenses he wanted me to buy. I can actually tell the difference between them and for me, glass is approximately equal to cr-39 but better than trivex in crispness which is better than the high index. Is it necessary for me to have the crispest vision possible maybe not to you but it is to me. Just like I think it's necessary to have a properly fit lense that doesn't bother my eyes or cover my sclera. "

9853,"So i have primary Soeren's since I was 21 years old I am now 29 years old. I work at a hospital and i got Pfizer vaccine the second dose was in March 10 . I decided not to get it in January I was scared of the side effects but waited forthr rest of my coworkers to tell me there side effects so I got in March . I take no medication but I do take supplements. The first dose I did feel tired,arm sore and a headache . Second dose I just had a sore arm other than that no side effects. I felt anxious and lightheaded on the first dose but that was just my anxiety. "
9854,"I saw a dermatologist for some mysterious red facial swelling I had a few times. It literally looked like I had a face lift/wind burn/acid on my face. I chalked it up to low vitamin C bc I had a craving for OJ and it seemed to calm it and so ever since then I take vitamin C and it never happened again. I figured it was a fibro symptom tbh. Like shit everything's broken, but long story long but not for my eyes. She was also really mean. I see an organic esthetician bc I had hyperpigmentation issues from hormone problems so she tries her best to help me. My contacts are acuvue hydroclear plus. I tried dailes once but $$$ also I felt like they were super thick compared to these. I have always used this brand bc they are super light supposedly. I always complained about that to the eye doc. I feel like my eyes are failing my contacts almost not the other way around. But again. Idk. I find the eye exam difficult. I feel stressed by choosing which one is clearer bc sometimes i feel like idk the answer. I tell them that I'm like yea I guess they are the same? I guess green is clearer ? Maybe I'm sabotaging my prescription? I see your 2 sentances and raise you 25. Sorry ;(. "

9856,"I love google, but yes if you suffer anxiety and panic attacks, maybe you should not google symptoms. If you are young and healthy, ocular migraines should not signify anything serious, if at all. I'd say you are young because this seems to be your first ""attack"". If you are a woman, then yeah, it is more common and usually linked to hormone levels. Apart from short sightedness, my eyes are healthy and I have had ocular migraines for over 40 years. They seem to get fewer as I approach menopause. "
9857,"Hi all, I am 24F hoping to get some advice on the abnormal findings from a recent eye exam. For all of you in the field, I apologize in advance. I don't know much about eye health and wasn't raised to be particularly mindful of keeping regular eye appointments. Covid has also made it extremely difficult to get appointments to help answer these questions, so I'm off-loading a lot of stuff here. I have a family history of macular degeneration and astigmatism, but no family history of glaucoma or other eye diseases I am aware of. I have 20/20 vision and only just recently started having issues with my eyes. I mainly make eye exams to get reading glasses for work, but wanted to make an appointment this time to also reassure I didn't have any other issues. The most recent appointment concerned me a bit for a few reasons. The doctor mentioned I have some abnormalities in the size of my optic nerve. I was told that one eye had greater cupping than the other and that I also had a blood vessel larger than normal in one eye. He asked if I had previous optometrists mention I had a large optic nerve. I have never been told this so assumed it was a new development. Also worth noting, my eye pressure was normal. I decided to reach out to get records from a previous eye exam back in 2017 to make sure all those tests came back normal. Apparently, my record indicated I had slightly higher than normal eye pressure and larger than normal sized nerve and retina in both eyes during this visit. I honestly don't recall being told this at the visit. The doctor from my most recent visit mentioned he thinks it is most likely a physiological issue I was born with, but wanted to be safe and refer me to the ophthalmologist for more testing. I have this appointment on June 30. The main reason I am concerned is due to an increasing number of neurological problems I have had over the last few months. I have daily headaches and monthly migraines, on top of visual auras which can be present with and without the migraine. These auras occur every other day and can best be described as either flashing balls of light and floating halos. Not sure if it's relevant, but I get these most often in the shower or immediately after. I also feel like my eyes are sore and heavy during the day, even when I am not feeling very tired. There have also been two occasions over the last 6 months were my fiance noticed my pupils were not the same size for at least a 30 minute time frame. Also, about one month ago, I began noticing my vision got blurrier than normal, but got better after a couple days. I was having difficulty reading signs and driving, despite normally not having issues before. I don't have any problems with blurry vision now. I had to start seeing a neurologist NP (can't get an appointment with the doctor) recently for random peripheral pains I've been having over the last several months along with getting help knocking down the number of headaches. I mentioned the various odd issues with my eyes but the NP didn't seem too concerned. I have not provided them an update since the eye exam. Additionally, in case anyone finds this useful, I did have an MRI of my brain recently which came back normal aside from evidence of chronic sinusitis. At this point, I am concerned that all these issues may be related and I just missed a diagnosis somewhere down the line by not keeping yearly eye exams. Anyone else out there have issues like these or have patients dealing with similar? I hate feeling paranoid but the more I think about all this the worse my anxiety is getting. How much of this information may be relevant to share with the ophthalmologist? Any suggestions on what resources I can look at in the interim to qualm the anxiety? Sorry for the long post. Appreciate any insight. "
9858,around 40-50 lbs so far. I already was eating fairly healthy. I just worked my way up to 5 miles of walking per day. 
9859,A printable 10 feet snellen chart? I want to try my vision once again but I see only the same chart with same letters on the web. If possible can u provide a chart which is inverted hat I can keep on a wall 10 feet away from a mirror ?? 
9860,"Good to know! With my left eye at 30 and 40 inches I can barely see any text, it's very blurry, while right feels quite sharp. "
9861,There aren't so many posts here. It's the same 10 people posting lol. Dry eye is incredibly common with 30% of the population having it according to many studies on PubMed. The ones who post here have an obsession with it and part of their diagnosis may be psychiatric. 
9862,Interesting post. I hadn't heard of this yet. Links below: https://www.aao.org/editors-choice/two-cases-of-corneal-transplant-rejection-after-co https://www.reviewofoptometry.com/news/article/corneal-transplant-rejection-may-occur-postcovid-vaccination Based on the information above it looks like these two cases are potentially related to the mRNA (Pfizer) vaccine and not the AZ vaccine. Just because there has been two cases of this occurring doesn't mean this will happen of course but they do state that bilateral cases of cornea rejection are very rare. If you're concerned I'd discuss with your optometrist and GP before getting a vaccine. As a note I've had both corneas replaced (at 19 and 21. I'm 34 now) and I'm fully vaccinated with AZ. 
9863,"Yep, number 4 over about 17 years. I had my first in the right as a teenager, followed by lasik to correct quite significant astigmatism had perfect 20-20 vision. Had the left done 4 years later, it was rough from the get go and healed horribly. My surgeon made some cuts in the cornea to try and help but vision was awful, we then considered an intra ocular lens but I would have lost my ability to accommodate at a really young age. Had the left redone and it healed well and is a nice clear graft but still off the charts astigmatism. Then unfortunately I developed a cone in my right eye just outside the area of my original graft, and then I got pregnant and it seemed to accelerate my KC like crazy and my vision deteriorated rapidly. I have a new surgeon because I moved and he said I have quite ""bulgy""<U+009D> eyes and where the graft and my eye meets there is almost a hump. So this time he cut the graft slightly smaller and pulled the eye taut to try and overcome this. So far so good. If the right continues to heal the way it is currently and I get decent vision, I will be going for graft number 5 in the left, using this different technique. Ironically my surgeon I'm with now hates cutting and avoids it as much as possible, he says every transplant is the roll of a dice, but since my vision was so poor and I can't tolerate sclerals I felt like it was worth taking the chance.

9866,"**The facts:** My vision in my right eye went from -1.75 to -0.50. Less dramatically, my left eye went from -2.50 to -2.00 My vision had previously been unchanged for *at least* 15 years. I've been having a sudden increase in what I've assumed are migraines. I do see halos around lights at night, including rainbow halos on bright lights. I normally use glasses for daily wear, and single-use contact lenses for sports. I am 34 years old female, with low blood pressure and no diabetes. The rest of my exam was largely normal. I do have hypothyroidism, ankylosing spondylitis, a migraine history, and pseudopapilledema (diagnosed 2004 via MRI). **The background:** So I've been having issues for several months with ~twice-weekly somewhat-atypical migraines behind my right eye. I have a history of migraines going back 10+ years, but they've been well managed so the sudden change in frequency was of concern. I was originally planning on jumping back into migraine treatment but then suddenly about a month ago realized my vision had dramatically improved in my right eye, that I could read small lettering at a distance, read street signs, the whole works. At that point, I figured maybe my migraines were being triggered by wearing glasses with a now-incorrect Rx, so I started using my glasses less (which is a novel experience, actually being able to see well enough to function without them). I have also been putting in my left contact only, which is getting me close enough to normal for days I need to do a lot of driving (though driving at night currently *sucks*). Except then I realized that the halos I see around lights at night (that I had been attributing to my glasses lenses getting fogged by mask breath) were actually present with my bare vision. Including rainbow halos around bright lights. So I consulted Dr. Google, panicked about acute closed-angle glaucoma, because what if my migraines were actually glacoma attacks?? and got squeezed into my doctor's schedule short notice because she's great and I love her. She checked my pressure, said it was good. My optic nerves looked the same as always, my angles were open, there were no signs of inflammation, and my peripheral vision testing was fine. And then she did refraction testing, and, well, you can see above how that turned out. **The result:** I've ordered a few pairs of glasses in my brand new Rx from Zenni to get me by for now. My optometrist is having me come back in a month (provided nothing changes before then in which case I've been ordered to call her right away) to revisit the issue and possibly do more thorough testing (including more glaucoma tests?) with the hopes that wearing correct glasses might solve the entire issue. I've also been given a recommendation for a neurologist to look into the migraine side of the equation. My optometrist doesn't know what might have caused my vision to suddenly improve, and says she's never seen that before for someone near-sighted. **The question:** Is this true? Do I have some Weird Shit going on? Am I going to end up as a case study or have some syndrome named after me? Is there something else I should be looking into? If you've seen this happen before please let me know! I don't really like being a medical mystery. :(. "
9867,"45M, Myopia diagnosed at age 9. I'm 1 week in. Prior to this, had to wait far too long (plus 1 extra year, thanks COVID-19) to have an exam and have my prescription checked. Vision was noticeably strained & blurry. Fine print and product labels completely illegible without a magnifying glass, but road signs & driving still OK, though less so at night. I've been getting used to the new lenses and, 90% of the time, they're spot-on perfect. Yeah, moving causes motion blur and stairs are no fun, but that's apparently par for the course. Walking around outdoors, everything looks great. Driving, everything looks great. Hand-held items, devices, labels, fine print, all sharp as can be. The screen at my desk, spot-on. But I have a ""fun"" computer in the den (an old hand-me-down instead of using the laptop & a Chromecast to stream TV). When I use it as a computer, as I'm doing now, I can't quite get the text into focus no matter how big I make it. Images & video are pretty good. But reading on this screen wears my eyes out, makes them water incessantly, and never gets sharp no matter which part of the lens I look from. I CAN read on it; it's just not pretty. Things I've tried with some minor, but not complete success: * Straightening the angle * Inching closer * Bigger font size * Backlighting * It is worse when my eyes are tired, noticeably so... but persists, if less so, when they are fresh All these things help, but nothing quite brings the text into focus, even at 40 point font (text is legible far smaller than that; I wanted to see if there was a point at which it got sharp; there isn't). It's an *old*LCD TV, probably no more than 720p, roughtly 10 feet from my face. 55 inches. All I want is opinions: Is this circumstantial, from what I'm trying to do, or is the prescription imperfect? Is there a way I could tell? It seems odd that I have basically zero issues anywhere but this one application. "
9868,"Keep practicing. I find that most people have their own little unique way of inserting the lenses that works best for them. Take your time. Don't be discouraged or put too much pressure on yourself. When I got my lenses at the doctor, he told me that he never had a patient leave the office without being able fo insert the lenses. Well, guess what? I was number one. What a way to make a person feel bad about themselves. But with practice I can now do it without any problems. I say practice on your own. I personally didn't find someone standing over me and watching helpful at all. You're inserting something into your eye so it is mainly psychological- if you are committed to practicing, you will find an insertion method that works for you. Personally, look straight into the mirror and put the lens in the very far corner of my eye (not the corner close to my nose) - I then move my eyeball into the lens. I've been putting my lenses in this way for over 20 years! Don't stare at the lens on your finger while you are moving it into your eye. Look straight in the mirror the whole time. "

9877,The FA test is usually pretty diagnostic in combination with oct. I had 5 injections I believe maybe one more or less I don't remember. My vision before them was 20/20 and after 20/20. I recently had a rebleed after two years of nothing and got one more eylea injection and it seems to be doing the job. 
9878,"You almost certainly have tilted nerves or optic nerve drusen or some other optic nerve abnormality if it's been stable for 4 years. Glaucoma is defined by progression, not irregularity. In fact, after around 4 years of no progression, you're not really even a glaucoma suspect any more. Still probably don't want to go without an eye exam for 10 years, just in case, but definitely nothing to worry about at this point. "
9879,"I can't comment on your degenerative myopia, since I don't have it. I have, however, had more OCT exams than I can count, because I had a retinal detachment 11 years ago. That surgery went really well and I got all my vision back. But my surgeon checks my retinas annually to make sure that there are no further problems. However, my main point is that OCT's are a piece of cake. They're just taking pictures of the back of your eye. They're not painful or difficult at all. Just follow the technicians instructions as best you can so that they get good pictures. The same is true of getting your eyes dilated. I have it done once a year. Once the exam is over, it just takes 2 to 6 hours for the dilation drops to wear off. I hope all of these tests give you good results. All the best. "
9880,Mine eventually went away. I saw a retina specialist about 10 years ago and I had to have laser surgery to fix a tear. Every once in a while I'll have flashes when I go from a lighted room to a dark one or if I'm really stressed out. But for the most part I don't have them anymore. The floaters don't bother me anymore if I don't focus on them.

Your insight gives me hope and I will surely look into the things you recommended. I feel a lot better after having this conversation with you. Thank you so much. I am gonna be 21 in November. I just don't want LOV. I am ready to do anything to prevent that. Medication surgery, clinical trials. I also have occluded angle. I don't know if that's good or bad. But then again people with IOP within normal limits still get glaucoma. So I am really bugged with the uncertainty of it all. "

And while I don't have signs of the more severe forms ""<U+0080><U+009D> AKC and VKC""<U+0080><U+009D>he thinks I have more of an atopic-like ocular allergy. It's weird because sometimes the anti-allergy drops work great. Other times they don't. They just itch a whole lot. Pretty much that's my only symptom. I have great lid hygiene as well to keep my kids as free of pollen as I can. I also have asthma, though that has actually improved quite a a bit in my 20s and now 30s.. "

The general guidance now is to remove all the stitches after about 2 years before they start to become brittle and break. I'm down to two or three interrupted stitches in one eye. They were all removed from my other one about 10 years ago. Hard contacts shouldn't really affect the stitches. They float on a film of tears and well fit they won't touch the surface. You may want to discuss with your doctor about having the stitches removed, if you're worried about them. In the end, they'll be able to point you in the best direction for your care. "

9890,"Hi All, 24M here. Last September, I developed persistent eye strain in my left eye, where it would continue to feel strained despite ""normal screen usage. My right eye was completely fine. In addition, every time I tried to keep ONLY my left eye open, it would quiver as if it were incredibly weak. This happens to this day, where my left eye feels incredibly weaker than my right. My right eye feels normal. Docs have brushed me off saying it is just an eye twitch, but my eye doesnt twitch. Its only constantly strained and quivers when I try to keep it open alonez The only other thing to note is around the same time last year, I developed some nerve issues that eventually subsided. These were attributed to re-activated EBV, the virus that causes mono. I have nowhere else to turn to and am desperate for help. My vision is correct on the astigmatism too. Has anyone dealt with this? Can you point me in the right direction? TLDR: Only left eye has felt strained for an entire year. Docs have brushed off eye quivering as a twitch but my eye doesnt twitch- quivers when I try to keep ONLY that eye open. Where to turn to next? "

Like there's a pact or something to not discuss bad Lasik. I'd like an honest answer to a question. My surgeon tells me he doesn't know if he can help the ""bad"" eye to any extent. I'd very much like to know if this is because Medicare won't pay for the repair, because it's related to a Lasik procedure. I've looked online, and cannot find an answer. "
9892,"Usually vision stays about the same after recovering from CXL. Sometimes it takes months for vision to stabilize and return to pre-procedure levels. BUT there is a possibility of it being worse. However, with untreated KC there is a very good chance of your vision getting much worse. KC does slow down and eventually stop progressing on it own as you get older. It usually stops by the time you are in your 40s. So if you are in your 30s, you do want evidence that your KC is progressing before doing CXL. Keep checking because KC progression is often a stop and start thing. Unfortunately KC is an erratic and unpredictable disease. It is hard to say anything with certainty. "

9894,"Hello! I'm a professional singer and have had Sjogren's for about 13 years. My advice is to take your medication. Plaquenil took the better part of a year to work for me, evoxac makes a tremendous difference too. Avoid caffeine, alcohol and anything else dehydrating including tea (yes tea!! unless it's caffeine free. I recommend Throat Coat by Traditional Medicinals). I always keep a bottle of the Biotene spray in my gig bag as well. Also watch your diet, I had to make sure I stick with really small snacks before gigs and I avoid anything with dairy, gluten or anything spicy or too acidic. Also, sleep with a humidifier and if you can afford it invest in a handheld humidifier you can bring to shows/gigs to use before you sing. I also regularly see an ENT that specializes in working with singers. I would try to make an appointment ASAP so they can assess your vocal chords to rule out any damage. Lastly, don't push it right now. It will take some time for the Plaquenil to start working so just take care of your voice and be patient. Do gentle warm ups every day to keep things in working order but I wouldn't do any shows/gigs for right now. I went through what you're going through and thought my voice was destroyed but it wasn't. I got my voice back to where it was eventually and sing in a private event (wedding) band currently. Don't worry, you won't lose your voice if you take it slow and follow my advice. It's a pain in the ass and it's scary but it's in your control. Let me know if you have any other questions. "

9903,I have VSP insurance so every year I get an allotment I can spend on eyewear. Since I got lasik 5 years ago I can use that money on sunglasses instead of contacts. Last year the DR recommended getting a pair of blue light blocking glasses since I work on a computer all day. They got me a pair with a small prescription because they thought that was the only way insurance would cover it. Is it possible that wearing an unnecessary prescription could mess with my vision? In the last week or so I feel like it hasn't been as sharp and things further away are a little blurrier than normal. I'm a 32 male with glaucoma who had lasik done 5 years ago if that helps. I take drops every night for the glaucoma and the pressure has been good. I see my glaucoma eye doctor next week and plan on asking him but would appreciate any info. Thank you. 
9904,I have VSP thru my job but have had private ones in the past that were like $20 a month. I've never had an insurance that didn't cover them for medically necessary and they all let me get a new set every year. I'd google some of the top providers and call to confirm they cover.

9907,"I'm starting to worry as my vision in my right eye is worsening fast. I have several questions about the procedure, I heard once you get a transplant you need to get another one after around 10 years is this true? Please mention anything you think I should know about. "
9908,"Yes I do! I get Aura Migraines which started last year. Lasts for about 25 minutes and then I get my migraine.

If your topography isn't changing there's no reason to risk even a 1% chance of complications. My KC manifested itself in my 30s, but I've always had terrible vision, so my eyes might be a special kind of messed up. I take naps in my sclerals, and I am psycho about hygiene when putting them in and never shower or swim with them in. Never had a problem. My prescription wasn't doing the job and I went for an eye exam and found out I had KC, my topography hasn't changed at all since my initial diagnosis. "
9910,"Hello all, just discovered this sub. I wanted to see if anyone else has shared in my experience here. For background, I have a history of autoimmune disease and I have been on immune suppressing drugs my whole life. Since I was a teenager (25f now) I have felt small, hard lumps beneath my lower eyelids. I wear glasses but other than that these bumps never bothered me, and eye doctors told me they were harmless. About three years ago, my eyes began giving me trouble, and I was getting eye infections just about every other month. After a few of these incidents, my eye doctor told me that my oil glands were clogged, and told me to do hot compresses and massages along with twice-daily Restasis. Though the Restasis seemed to fix most of my symptoms, the bumps never really went away, in fact, new ones appeared. I stopped doing compresses because I could never make my glands expel anything, at least not enough to make these lumps go down. About four months ago my symptoms returned, after about two years of ""remission""<U+009D> on Restasis. It feels as though the Restasis isn't helping any more and I have a somewhat new, large lump under my bottom right lid. The discomfort from keeping my eyes open during the day drives me to do hourly moisturizing sprays on my lids, and even then the discomfort is awful. I can't effectively do work on my computer, I can't have a fan on in my house or the AC on in my car. A month ago when I told my doctor this, she told me to keep doing the Restasis and to do more hot compresses. She suggested I find someone who can do a Lipiflow treatment on me as well. I scheduled a consult with a doctor who offers this treatment for next week. I feel like the Restasis is not offering me any relief any more, and that my oil glands are too clogged and solid for me to expel myself. I don't want to be on Restasis for the rest of my life anyway... do you think the Lipiflow will help my situation? I have no idea how much it costs yet, which worries me, but if this will improve my quality of life then so be it. Thank you ahead of time, I really appreciate that this group exists! This situation has me at the end of my rope both mentally and physically. "

9912,"I've had a lot of floaters for at least 10 years. When they first started they caused me a massive amount of anxiety. I actually ended up getting wrap around sunglasses so my entire field of vision was covered whenever I left the house, and at home I bought blackout curtains so no sunlight could get in. After I had them for awhile, and after having two doctors tell me it's nothing to worry about, the anxiety got much better and I ended up thinking about them much less. I still have them, but for the most part my brain just got used to them and I rarely even notice anymore unless I choose to focus on them. Sometimes I even play a game when I'm bored where I move my eyes to make them ""dance around"". They don't really bother me anymore. "

9914,Hey I'm 25 years old and may need to undergo a cataract surgery soon. I'm wondering how patients that has underwent this sort of surgery see up close. Please mention what lens you've gotten. My gut feeling is telling me that I'd like to have good vision up close to medium distance without glasses and worse for far away. I say this because I normally like to hold my phone closer to my face and sit close to a computer monitor or tvs. Is that a good idea and is it even possible? Other questions I'd like to ask: 1. How is reading without glasses like? 2. If you look down at your chest and look at your hands are they all blurry without glasses? Is it terrible or just a bit harder to read small text? 3. Would you have done something differently? Thanks for all and any contributions.

9917,"Key distinctions are duration: if the flashing lights PERSIST, as in, they stay in your vision for longer than a few seconds, they're unlikely to be retinal tear-related. This is especially true if they persist for a few minutes (sometimes even 15 minutes to half an hour). Google ""scintillating scotoma"" and look at images that people have made/drawn/painted to represent what they see. If yours are similar to those, it's also more likely to be migraine with visual aura. If your flashing lights are literally just that: flashing, as in, they are fleetingly there and then they're gone, with the duration of a lightning bolt, then that's more worrisome. There's unfortunately really no way to be sure without an exam though. "
9918,Hello I am 24 year old diagnosed before covid. I have not heard about this condition and have not faced any problem till now. But now i am having lot of anxiety and depression due to which i am not able to focus on my studies . My left eye is bad I get by glasses as my right eye is taking all the [weight](https://weight.

9920,"I would plan on taking at least a week to be sure she's in the clear and can focus on relaxing and not worrying as much about your baby. If possible, maybe play it by ear for the following week? For me, my severe light sensitivity lasted about two days, and then it hurt to go outside with sunglasses on for about two weeks. I think taking care of a baby would be an added stress to the recovery and having that help would be wonderful. Make sure she has at least cheap prescription sunglasses ready to go after her procedure because it'll make it easier for her to be outside. I didn't have any and got to go out with the fabulous old lady sunglasses on top of my regular glasses. It's been about 10 years since my procedure and I'm not sure what if anything has changed about how it's performed, but I can tell you my vision deterioration has slowed considerably. I know it's scary to consider a procedure for your eyes, particularly as a stay at home parent, but it worked well for me and for all the stress and pain I was in for the two days following the procedure, I'd do it again. I was very depressed when I got my diagnosis and I totally understand that it's hard to face, particularly with being in charge of a young child. I'm glad you're being such a supportive partner for her, it's hard enough to take care of a 1 year old \*without\* this diagnosis during a pandemic!

9921,"Hello everyone. I have a question about refractive eye surgery. For whatever reason (ignorance, poverty) my parents never took me to an optometrist when I was young, so I only got glasses in my early 20s. I never felt like I needed them either: I have perfect vision on my right eye, but about 15-20% on the left. I discovered I have mixed astigmatism. I'm in my mid 30s now and I finally have the means to get refractive eye surgery. I just got back from an evaluation and the surgeon dropped this on me: my left eye's sight never fully developed, so it doesn't matter if I get surgery, I'll never see better than what I currently do with my glasses. That was a bit devastating. I'm thinking about getting a second opinion, but I'm not sure. Is this an ""it is what it is"" thing or do I have options? Thanks! "
9922,"Ok fair enough. I guess I have been, although I've never been made aware of that distinction until now. As someone who's worn contacts for 13 years this is new to me, usually they would just adjust the prescription for contacts on the fly by doing a bit of math. But hey, sounds like you know more about it than me! Thanks for the help. I'll get my optometrist to have a look. "
9923,Ohh thats so relieving. Thank you sir. I was kinda concerned about getting RD by using phone too much. But yeah i'm not myopic at all. No underlying health conditions too.

At the time, I've had been having lite headaches, lite dizziness (not so much dizziness but, more as I recall explaining to my doctor at the time, some sense of ""out of sync"" or like if I had two beers, for the lack of a better explanation - I'm not English so forgive me) for a few years. Once I described my sensation the doctor immediately started testing me for brain problems and prescribed an MRI although he told me to, just in case, go to an ophthalmologist first. Which I did and never got an MRI. I've been diagnosed with lite Astigmatism in one eye. Like 0.5. Once I started wearing glasses to work at my computer, the problems were gone. Immediately. And that was it. This was 30 years ago. And in the process, I learned that Astigmatism gives one person light sensitivity which also explains (I think) why I've used my car's sun blinds even at night (street/road lights just mess up with my vision). Maybe it's your situation also. Who knows? That would be a good thing, I think. Good luck. "

9933,"I feel you. I first got diagnosed with bleph in my first appointment. But oh boy the ride to find a routine! As someone else said, find an ophthalmologist that runs you under some tests! This way you can know how severe your condition is and how to actually have a routine that does something for you. Change doctors as often as you can if the current ones aren't being considerate or helpful. But well, sometimes blepharitis might be caused by demodex mites (which can be helped with ivermectin or tea tree oil eye cleansers). Right now I'm trying a cleanser with them (can't tell you the brand cause it's custom made by my ophthalmologist clinic) but prior to that, I was using Bioderma Gel cleanser (pink bottle) and it helped me a lot, people suggest baby shampoos but my eyes absolutely couldn't tolerate them. I'd suggest you looking for cleansers like Ocusoft lid scrubs, Blephagel and Systane lid wipes. Also check hypochlorous acid sprays (ocusoft has one, I believe tower 28 also has one but it's not specifically for your eyes). Annnnd maybe a heated mask like bruder, they last about 6 months and it's washable and reusable. Took me a while before actually buying it but it's so much easier to use, so that it makes me actually use it instead of avoiding the whole thing. And finally, looking for non preservative eye drops. Sometimes preserved ones sting like a bitch. Everyone feels stressed about their health, specially with the eyes. You're not alone! :) Please don't forget that with chronic conditions, it gets better and sometimes it get worse, but you'll find a routine to care for it and have less and less flare-ups. Take it from me, two years ago I was having flare-ups weekly. Now I go by a few months without them. "
9934,"I am a bit over 40 and have been wearing soft contact lenses for 25+ years. My vision has mildly deteriorated over that time, but not significantly (both eyes are around -5.0 with slight astigmatism). What has changed is my tolerance for contact lenses. I used to wear them every day from the moment I got up till the moment I went to sleep, but about 5 years ago I found my eyes sometimes drying out or getting uncomfortable. I went to an optometrist and switched from Acuvue 2 to Acuvue Oasys, although I'm not sure it made a big difference. The other change was to start removing my contacts when I got home from work. On the weekends sometimes I skipped putting them in altogether. During the pandemic (work from home) I have been wearing them even less, because the discomfort has gotten worse! Recently I went back to an optometrist to try some different brands to see if they would improve things. I am currently trialling Biofinity and B+L Ultra, but it seems no matter what brand I try, they all feel dry or uncomfortable, and I'm always relieved when I can take them out. Is this a normal thing? My current optometrist says that my eyes are healthy and I shouldn't expect contacts to be completely ""unnoticeable"", but I'm not sure he believes me when I say that for decades I never even noticed they were in. Is it possible that my eyes have just changed and they don't like contacts any more? "
9935,"Hello all, A stupid question, but nonetheless one I'd like to hear about. I got a sudden increase in floaters recently, and went to get my eyes checked. The eye doc said everything was fine, but said not to dart my eyes back and forth a lot to try and see the floaters, as this can cause retinal detachment. I'd never read this anywhere else online and, being a very anxious person, now it's all I think about lol. I am entering treatment for anxiety soon (covid-19 has really not been helpful here) but I thought I'd just pose the question here: is this true? I'm 22, had a full eye exam, and they said everything else was fine. Thank you! "
9936,"Helloo, posted here a couple times before and the answers are always very useful so basically my eyesight was always 6/6 till keratoconus came and fucked up my sight on my left eye. In 4 months my right eye which is the 6/6 eye increased in a diopter (i'm 22) and the doctor suggests to get crosslinking done on that eye but he did say there's a chance my sight won't be 6/6 after the surgery. Has anyone else here done crosslinking on 6/6 eye and can share their experience?

9937,"I don't think that you understand the term ""lazy eye"". You probably had surgery for crossed eye. Lazy eye is non fixable. There isn't surgery for it. What it means is that your brain does not precube light signals for this one eye and the musce is weaker. Patching is only helpful when you are a kid, up to 12 years old. When you are an adult it is waste of your time. I have lazy eye and it doesn't mean it goes away or points into different direction than my healthier eye. Vision on my lazy eye with glasses is 20/100 while the other eye with glasses is 20/25. Do you understand the difference now? "

9939,This is something that I am a bit anxious about since my last appointment about a week ago. I am 26 years old with high myopia. I took a peripheral vision test and another test that gave me score of 0.4ish for each eye (not quite sure what test this was) and my ophthalmologist said my results were borderline for both tests. he doesn't think I have glaucoma. The doctor said my nerves might be on the larger side and a previous ophthalmologist said that this is common for asians. The doctor also said that he wants to see me again in a year to monitor this. I have no family history of glaucoma that I know of. Also my pressures are normal. Is this something I should be worried about? Is there a chance I actually have glaucoma but it's hard to tell? I don't want to be losing my vision for the next year or something lol. 
9940,"I took Plaquenil for over 15 years. At first I took a low dose and it didn't seem to help. The rheumatologist tried many combinations of drugs and none helped. I finally switched doctors and the new guy took me off everything else and doubled the Plaquenil. That worked great for me for a very long time. My visual field test started showing the typical signs of decreased vision due to Plaquenil. They caught it early and I do not notice it at all. It is not reversible, but if you do your yearly screening, it will be caught early and you can stop it before it affects your sight. "
9941,"I'm 24 and I've been experiencing this for about 2 years now. It's especially noticeable in a bright environment, like a bathroom for example. My eyes have been checked and they're perfectly healthy, so what might be causing this? Is it possibly something neurological? "

9945,"I can relate a lot to the feeling of being lazy :// and I rationally know that is not the reality, but my mind inevitably makes me think that. So I keep repeating to myself that I'm not lazy, that I have a diagnosed problem that gives me fatigue and brain fog and random aches and so many problems with my eyes and mouth.... and somehow my brain tells me ""yeah yeah yeah, okay, that's all invented."" ...so.... what can I say.... I'll repeat myself, I can totally relate with what you're describing and I'm sorry you're also going through it. Something I found helpful for the fatigue is making sure I have regular down time so that I don't fall behind tasks (as someone also said, if I plan a morning in the nature, then I can't clean the whole house or cook a huge meal afterwards because I don't have the energy, so I plan lighter activities or rest), going to bed always at the same time, and regular exercise. The latter is super helpful because it's good for the mood too, so you have a double effect :) I was also recommended to try a very low dose of plaquenil, but I was hesitant and had to move out of the country and change doctors, so I decided not to for now. I'll see of my new doctor will recommend it as well. As for the eyes, I always recommend (silicone, ""permanent"") punctal plugs. Best decision I made. Maybe with those in you can collect more tears and the eye surgery becomes maybe more viable. I've always heard that they don't recommend it if your eyes are already dry (either from Soeren'a or other reasons), because that's one of the side effects it gives. But you know, -12 it's a lot. Maybe the benefits outweigh the downsides in your case ðŸ¤ž I wish you luck!!!! "
9946,"I felt the same way in 2019 when I was diagnosed. It hit me lake a barrel of bricks preventing me from getting my license at 21. I sought to gain the illusion of control by navigating the insurance process and getting cross linking scheduled. Additionally, I read at least 50 medical journals trying to gain additional control. My worries ended for the most part when I had CXL done. Now at 23, my life feels relatively normal with glasses and contacts. Even when I went to a corneal doc for the first time since the pandemic in January and they said they potentially saw a shift, I'm not terribly concerned. As I already know the process if I have to get CXL again and this time I can have short term disability to use. Point of the the story it gets much better in my opinion. "
9947,"I had epi-off cross linking done about 10 years ago in Toronto (Canada). I can't remember for sure but I think they gave me valium to help stay calm. I was also encouraged to bring in ear buds and my preferred calming music. The procedure itself was not a big deal. They will freeze your eyes with eye drops, and they go numb almost instantly. I didn't feel any pain at all. It'll seem like they're doing things right in front of your eye because you won't feel it. The drops I had were dark orange and the light was purple/UV, so mostly I remember enjoying the effect of orange/purple swirls crossing my vision each time a drop went in. You'll probably have an attendant with you the whole time. After the surgery when the freezing wore off it was pretty uncomfortable, like the worst case of cutting raw onions you've ever had. You'll get pain killers and eye drops. Take the pain killers on time and it won't be too bad. I think the pain lasted about a day. Get some good podcasts or audiobooks lined up because screen time won't be possible. It is most definitely worth the day or so of discomfort to halt the progression of the disease. Good luck! "
9948,"Got my glasses at 17, my vision got worse at 18 as expected, but when I got checked when I was 20 it was significantly better. Sphere moved from -2.00 to -1.25 in one eye and similar numbers in the other. Had to get my glasses changed because the prescription was too strong. How does this happen? I did not lose any weight or have any change in blood sugar. "

9950,I have been wearing glasses for over 15 years. I recently switched over to Acuvue Oasys one a day. When I take my contacts out and put my new glasses on my phone screen and laptop screen look convex and more 3D-ish. Is that normal? 
9951,"I had a parasitic infection from my RGPs a decade ago, left a scar that blinded me in that eye. After 10 years now, the scar is still there but barely visible to the naked eye. Because my eyes are fragile (ehlers danlos), my doctors do not want to operate, so I just live with it. The eye alone is pretty shitty, but it provides enough visual feedback to compliment my good eye and let me live my life. "
9952,So would I have to go back in and get refitted and everything ? I wanted a trial of all three and test them or multi days... Are most places like that stingy for trials? I paid 60 for a fitting that should cover a couple 15-20 dailies. 
9953,Thank you! The puff machine right? I think highest I had on that was 19. 
9954,"I was diagnosed in both eyes in 2009 when I was 14. Unfortunately my right eye was pretty far gone with scarring but my left eye was still near perfect, around 20/30. I ended up going to Canada and had both eyes crosslinked at the same time shortly after the diagnosis, because at that point CXL was not in the US except for trials. Afterwards, I never really needed correction for left eye but correcting the right eye was a challenge. White scarring in that eye made it very light sensitive with corrected vision, to the point where I could barely open my eyes without squinting in my house. In 2016, the right eye had to be crosslinked again as it was deteriorating, but luckily this time my doctor did it in the US, and insurance covered part of it. In 2018, with still no correction easily available for my right eye, I opted for a full thickness corneal transplant. The transplant improved my vision from 20/400 to 20/100, got rid of the scarring and gave me much better options for correction. I ended up getting a scleral lense on my right about a year after the transplant, which corrects it to 20/25. I like it but I had some issues with the corrected right eye working with my uncorrected left eye, the vision was weird and it's hard to describe, so my doctor recommended a scleral on the left. The left scleral correct me to 20/25 also, but I suffer from terrible ghosting out of that lense to the point where is is practically unusable. Recently I did order glasses that should correct each eye to 20/30 (fingers crossed), just waiting on them to made. Maybe once I get more money I'll give sclerals another shot, as I wasn't a fan of the Optometrist my Opthalmologist recommend. I just wanted to share my story as I was really excited when I found this group, and I've been through a variety of the treatments people talk about a lot, in case anyone had any questions. "
9955,No that's still very helpful that it seems odd to you as well thanks so much! I always thought contact prescription was just calculated off the glasses prescription. Using the copper vision calculator neither of my glasses prescriptions gives me -4 for my contacts. For my -4.5 I get a result of -4.27 but then still tells me to get -4.5 power contact lenses. For the -3.75 I get a result of -3.59 and tells me to get -3.75 contact lenses. Presumably supposed to round up to the next .25 so my current contact prescription makes sense. But I have the -4.00 for contacts in black and white on the same piece of paper with the -4.5 for glasses from my decade old script. Freaky!

So what tests should I ask for? I can easily read smallest line on reading chart, but my eyes are just very tired after all day pc work. Do I have some hidden hyperopia despite being clearly in reading distance? I am 36. "
9960,"I am desperate to find something that helps with the dry mouth, because many nights it wakes me every few minutes, choking because I can't swallow. Dentek used to make oramoist which worked well. It was sour. They discontinued it. None of the sweet stuff works, most of it makes the dry moth worse! Biotene mouth was works for about 30 minutes, but then wears off, which does not do much for sleep. And, of course, not sleeping is horrible for my mental health. "
9961,"Unfortunately that is relative to each person's eye anatomy. Some people will develop glaucoma when the pressure is over 25, some will have glaucoma with a pressure lower than 14. You must be checked by an eye doctor who will probably order an OCT, and then be able to diagnose you. "
9962,"Good Afternoon All, I am a 25 year old Type 1 diabetic male who also suffers from panic disorder. I have frequent panic attacks, and am working on getting on better meds to alleviate this terrible beast. I've had diabetes for 22 years with good A1Cs and no diabetic related issues whatsoever. However, a week ago I had a panic attack. And when I did, I saw a bright spot in my vision that dwindled away over time and left a small blurry spot there. I immediately went to my optometrist the next day and he said that it was a microanureysm, likely related to an issue relating to blood pressure during these attacks (my heart rate will spike to 100-110 and BP 160s/90+). Long story short, I'm referred to a retina specialist. The retina specialist assured me that she believes it's an acute incident and already noticed some healing happening, despite the incident only happening roughly 4 days prior. She believes this will go away in time and believes the incident was a one-off thing. Everything I read online about microanureysms or any type of retinal damage seems to make me think that these changes to vision may be permanent. Am I missing something here, or could it have not truly been a microanureysm like my original optometrist suggested? Any reassurance or help you could provide me is much appreciated. EDIT: I'll also add that the retina specialist does not believe that this is truly retinopathy, despite having had a microanureysm. "
9963,"I started wearing glasses in 3rd grade but wasn't diagnosed with KC until fairly late (mid 30s). Beforehand I was always told I had ""some astigmatism""; no mention of KC until a really skilled optometrist caught it when he was unable to correct my vision to 20/20 with glasses or contacts. I even went for Lasik consult before I was diagnosed. They rejected me 2x but only said one of my corneas was ""too thin."" "
9964,"Selling glasses has almost always and still makes up the majority of most optometry office income. The profitability of contact lenses has declined so much from 10-20 years ago that it's barely worth selling them in office. This could possibly happen to glasses over time if online sales grow, which is why some offices are focusing more on medical exams instead of refractive exams. Some offices really push glasses sales, some do not. Just depends. Almost all optometry practice management groups / magazines / lectures encourage pushing multiple pairs of glasses on patients to make more money. "
9965,"It's when the cornea in your eye becomes cone shaped instead of curved and distorts your vision. It might get worse, but it might stay the same, which is why they're asking you to come back later to check its progress. Each person's experience with it is different. Most people get it around your age, I got it in my late 40s. Some people just see lights as blurs, I saw lights as a massive swirl. It can be corrected with a contact lens, or in extreme cases surgery, or slowed and stopped with crosslinking. I had a cornea transplant early last year which has improved things massively, but my doctor still recommends me getting a corrective contact lens. There are a lot of very helpful and supportive people on this subreddit, all with their own keratoconus stories, if you have more questions there will always be someone arround who can answer. "

His eye glasses ( per prescription above) cause his eyes to turn immediately when he wears them. Considering this should he continue to wear them ? Are the glasses making his eyes better or worse? \[We force him to wear when he watches TV. Other times he takes them off\] 2. His eye turns in, when he tries to focus something close (within 6 inches to 2 ft). When he looks at things 10 ft away (primary gaze), he is able to align the eyes & get binocular vision. What does this indicate ? What are the chances for him to get binocular vision when focuses things up close ? Is esotropia categorized by focusing distance ? Or is this an effect of myopic astigmatism ? 3. Does astigmatism evolve into amblyopia ? 4. Has anyone of you had the combination of these two (alternating esotropia & myopic astigmatism) ? What are the treatment options ? "
9967,"Yes it's the most accurate way to get it. Also being 40 you should manage your expectations. If you see worse with one eye, check and see if it happens to be worse up close. It's often useful to make one better far away, the other better up close. "

About a year ago my doctor told me I have convergence insufficiency and gave me a new prescription to help. Not exactly sure if it is helping or not, but it feels like an instant strain the moment I put them on. A bit different from dry eye, more like the eye is angry with me and frustrated from being used in reading. The moment I take the glasses of there is an instant relief. I regularly follow the 20 20 rule and take good care of my eyes, so I find this infuriating. Everything anyone has ever felt or thought has been written in books and I think it will make me genuinely depressed if I have to live with it for the rest of my life. Does Convergence Insufficiency get better if I use my glasses all the time? "

9973,"I've been on cevimeline for 7+ years and it makes a huge difference in my quality of life and ability to function at home and at work. I got really nauseas the first time I took it, and afterwards realized it was because I did not drink enough water when I took it. Tips: Take each dose with a cup of water. For me, that is about 20 . . . whatever the word is for not sip and not gulp, but the regular amount you would drink when drinking at a normal rate. Each dose gives me about 4.5 - 5 hours of saliva. I space my doses by 5 or more hours. If Cevimeline doesn't work for you, try the name brand, Evoxac. Or try the alternative for similar function: name brand Salagen or its generic, Pilocarpine. I haven't tried either of the last two because I was happy with the cevimeline I started with, but I've heard people say an intolerable side effect of Salagen and/or Pilocarpine is excessive sweating. Saliva is important for oral health and the digestive system. If prescription saliva production meds don't work, make sure you are using over-the-counter saliva aid methods. OTC saliva aids and oral moisturizers: sugar-free gum and hard candy, dry mouth lozenges, dry mouth mouthwash and dry mouth spray. Local drug stores often have a dry mouth section. Biotene, Act, Oral B and xylimelts are common brands. Sip and swish water. Get teeth cleaned at least once per year. "

9976,"I'm very happy to answer all your questions! I was diagnosed last year after a sudden onset of symptoms. Dry mouth was the worst; I also had mild dry eyes. I was positive on all four of the blood tests they gave me--ANA, SSA (Ro52 & 60), SSB. No reason for a lip biopsy. (One person on this loop said they were left with a kidney-bean sized hole in their lip!) It took me 4 mos to figure out what was going on and get a diagnosis. Looking back, I may have had some symptoms 15 years ago. (I'm in my 50s now.) I have had excellent results with an anti-inflammatory diet. (I give details low down on a thread with a title something like, Can drinking too much water decrease saliva.) My dry mouth has improved from very uncomfortable to livable. My eyes have returned to nearly normal, I would say. (Clinically, my dental hygienist and ophthalmo. no longer consider me to be a dry mouth or dry eye patient.) I made a real commitment, though. Zero added sugars and zero gluten is hard. I prepare all my own food. I really hate having this disease, but I am lucky--my symptoms are modest now. My hope is that they will continue to improve. I'm looking forward to a cure. "
9977,I had cxl epi off on both eyes in June. I recovered well and fast according to doctors. Got fitted for kerasoft lenses in October and have been wearing them since with 20/20 combined vision. The past 2 weeks I've noticed my good eye is declining. I've noticed ghosting and just overall blurrier vision with my contact although it's not as bad with my glasses however still noticeable. Has anyone experienced changes this far after cxl was performed? My good eye was also extremely mild kc and I'm pretty sure at my last topography in September the kmax value was like mid 40s. The doctors actually said it's very close to a normal eye just in the very early stages. 
9978,"I have pretty severe myopia in both eyes (\~ -9.0), and was using regular contact lenses with success. But my prescription has been worsening recently and I think there are some newer retinal holes forming. So I was prescribed multifocal lenses to I believe reduce further tearing, slow down progression? Note, I don't need reading glasses, although I'm around the age people start needing them (early 40s). But at each fitting they keep tweaking the prescription, and recently I've started feeling unwell on a semi-regular basis (negative COVID). I wrote it off to stress initially, but I've just realized that it's especially worse with prolonged computer use / screen scrolling / paperwork. So my question is: Can multifocal lenses cause headaches and nausea / vomiting? b) does it even make sense to have multifocal lenses in an adult without presbyopia for preventative reasons? (I did the sin of googling, and all I can see is studies in children). It's difficult to get in to see my optometrist that originally prescribed these lenses. The others in the office don't seem to know why I'm on these lenses (they are just checking prescription for acuity and fit). And if I'm feeling sick in the past 14 days, which is happening more than not now, they don't want me in the office because of COVID precautions. I'm still going to follow up with the office, but any insight into those questions would be very helpful for what my next steps might be. "
9979,"So just for starters, it's super late and I can't sleep because of my anxiety over this.. I was googling it.. BIG mistake. I have to ask somewhere for some peace of mind & maybe finally be able to ease my anxiety enough to fall sleep. Background Info: I have been wearing contacts for 4ish years. I tried them a bit in high school but had issues with them folding & going up into my eye (which I know now is because I wasn't wearing astigmatisms lenses lol). I stepped away from them until I could afford them myself. You see I have an astigmatism in both eyes, and have found that Acuvue Oayases (sp) Astigmatism lenses worked the best for me.. the first whole 2.5 years I had my contacts I wasn't responsible.. I wore them for months on end. Never took them out. Used the same pair for months without putting new lenses in. Like stupidity! I Have Changed MY Ways Now! For a bit I was having constant issues with what I assumed was a reoccurring stye or the other ones that start with a ""C""<U+009D>and bought OTC treatment and successfully cleared them up(2 and a half years ago). After treating the eye issue 3 times in a row, I decided to grow up and I now take my contacts out every night and usually only wear them when I work.. 3-5 days a week worn for no longer than 5-8 hours on average. I am currently using an old pair that is missing a small chunk out of the edge (I KNOW! Bad bad bad, but I've been so depressed & haven't wanted to even wear my contacts lately and my glasses have a huge crack in them.. I'm not gonna wear them in public! So I have been just going kinda blind, I don't drive far) and because of this I have been wearing my contacts as little as possible and alternate them with some dailies that actually is my roommates. She gave me a new one of hers to see if it'll work.. it does but not the best.. I'm going to call and make an appointment with my primary eye doctor on Monday regardless of any advice I am given here.. Okay skip to CURRENT: I have always noticed my eyes feel a little weird after I take my contacts out.. my left one is usually always fine after a bit and the right would take a little longer. It feels like there's something in my eye.. my doctor said this is normal and takes a bit for your eye to get ""used""<U+009D> to not having the contact in anymore. But the right one is still acting weird. It is also the one that the ripped one goes in.. could that missing chunk be stuck under my top lid somewhere even if this happened 2ish months ago (noticed the piece missing while putting my contacts in the next day) & if the answer is no or unlikely, then I think I compromised my right eye's health by using my contacts irresponsibly.. & you should keep reading.. tell me honestly.. how screwed could I be? SYMPTOMS: I should add I'm a 27 year old female. Don't know if weight or height matter, if they do I'll add it! Feels like something is stuck in right eye after contact removal. (Seems to always be ""stuck""<U+009D> in the same general area of my R eye every single time) Drops made for contact irritation don't work nor does solution or anything else I've tried. I have stringy eye gunk towards the end of my shift & after about 5 hours of lens wear. It is usually clear or a little bit of milky tint and it never smells odd, but is very sticky. My eye has often been gunked up in the morning. Has been stuck shut 2 times since symptoms started. Very very rarely I get a sudden very painful achy feeling like my eyeball is bruised when I rub my eye & the tenderness lasts about 15-20 mins after (could be cause I rub it too hard, but I always rub it hard it usually feels good) Despite all this my eyes don't seem any more irritated or dry (always a bit dry) than they usually are and my left eye seems to be completely fine.. they don't look cloudy or discolored to me..? I'm super afraid that my eye is all messed up and I can't even feel sorry for myself when it was my own VERY stupid fault. & I will be making an appointment on Monday to have it looked at because I didn't realize that this could be bad until I read an article about irresponsible contact lenses in a magazine today... TLDR: I think I messed my eye up by contact lense overuse.. now read Current & Symptoms. "
9980,I have worn contacts for over 20 years (gas permeable) and no problems. I think they are very safe. It would be hard to go back to glasses. 
9981,"I have known a few people who say progression after a decade of stabilization, yes. KC is very random. Once it's been stable for a few years, it is likely to stay mostly stable. But, as you know, there's always a chance it will take a turn for the worse and get suddenly worse. I am in the same situation as you. I'm 30 and have one useless eye (I'd have to quit my job if I only had my bad eye, even with high-end custom sclerals, nothing can be done), and my ""good"" eye hasn't progressed. I also get scans every six months and am prepared to get CXL at the first sign of progression. "

9984,"I'm 58 without any real eye issues. Started wearing glasses in my 40s, progressives when I hit 50 and get an eye exam every couple years. I started seeing a cloudy shape in my left eye about six weeks ago that made me crazy so I went to a new Optometrist approx 10 days ago. He said I had a large floater and to watch for flashes of light. He also seemed surprised when he saw something called a drusen in my left eye. I never heard of it or had it mentioned to me by any other Optometrists. He took a lot of time looking at my eyes and took several focused pictures, especially of my left one. He told me everything looks fine, watch for light flashes and to come back in a year. Now I'm experiencing a very slight dull ache in my left eye.. and it's actually a little painful if I gently push on it. It's all new to me. There is no redness, vision change or anything. I'm wondering if this ache could be coming from the floater or this drusen thing. Also is it likely I've had this drusen all along and it's just better technology that makes it easier to spot? "
9985,I feel the same way. My sweet spot is about 20 per day but there are other ODs in our practice who are seeing 30-40 successfully. I was asked to book 50 due to my high no show rate but even seeing 30 would be pushing it for me. How many do you prefer to see? 
9986,"Thank you for sharing, that makes me feel better about calling it a disability. My brother is just about to finish nursing school and he says it is a disability too.

9987,"I'm 32 and I've worn contacts for almost a decade now. I've never had this issue before, but within a couple hours of putting my contacts in, my eyes begin to dry out and as the day goes on it becomes quite uncomfortable. I find myself blinking more often and then I start to get excess eye dirt and sharp little pain in the corner of my eyes (which Google says is from dry eyes?). I've bought contact rewetting eye drops but that doesn't seem to help much. So I guess my issue is that my eyes are dry, but I don't know if it's the contacts causing it or if my eyes are dry already, and as a result the contacts are just exacerbating the issue. Before I pay to go see my eye doctor I was wondering if anyone here might know what the deal is? Is this normal to suddenly experience? Could it be from the weather / seasonal allergies and somehow I've just never noticed it as much in prior years? I tried fresh contacts twice (thinking maybe the first pair was defective); the only thing I haven't tried is changing my soak solution, but I've been using the same kind for ages (Bausch and Lomb BioTrue) so I can't see how that would make a difference. Thanks in advance for any input you may have! "

9989,"My symptoms started almost 10 years ago after having major surgery. After doing a lot of research, and talking to the surgeon, we decided it's not nerve damage as I originally suspected. About 3 years later I started seeing a rheumatologist for my arthritis and fibromyalgia. He wasn't convinced it's Sjogren's, but did test me several times over the 5 years I saw him, and every time, the tests came back normal. The only one I haven't had is lip biopsy. He didn't bring it up, so I didn't ask for it. He did however put me on Salagen for my dry mouth, and Tramadol for pain, then eventually put in my chart that due to the fact that I have the symptoms, and have for so long, that he believes I do have it. About a year ago he stopped prescribing narcotics and sent me to a pain management specialist saying he doesn't think there is much else he can do for me. "

9992,"Hi everyone, I'm 21. I visited an optometrist today and he diagnosed me with Keratoconus in my left eye. I'm shocked and concerned, as I'm sure many others in this sub were. Some background: The left eye has progressively gotten worst the last 4 years to the point where I can only clearly read words about a foot away out of it (I had perfect vision before that). My right eye is relatively good (+1.75 and -1.00). For the past 4 years, I could see well because of how much my right eye compensates. In fact, I often didn't wear glasses altogether. However, I've definitely noticed a drop in vision the last few weeks, especially in the left eye. The optometrist referred me to an ophthalmologist in the area. I plan on making an appointment first thing Monday morning. What are some questions that I ask him or her during the first visit? I feel angry at myself for being nonchalant about my vision and missing the warning signs. Also very scared for what the future holds. My main concern is keeping at least my right eye in relatively good shape. "
9993,"I have noticed that I am getting eye pain, mostly on my left eye, occasionally the right after laying on my side looking at my phone and sometimes just laying on my side in general. It feels like a stinging pain and pressure. I have had dry eye on the left side and it was confirmed at an eye exam, I went because it felt like something was in my eye. I was given eye drops and it went away after a few days. Since then I have been using refresh optive drops as needed and it does help some. My vision does not seem to be affected but I am getting a little concerned as this has been happening on and off for a few months. I wear glasses and occasionally daily disposable contacts. I do work at home and start at screens all day. I had an eye exam earlier this year no changes in my vision since my exam almost two years prior. They did optomap and the eye doctor said there might be some slight concerns about glaucoma, but I didn't seem too concerned because she said we will just follow up with a more thorough exam later. My eye pressure was 14 during the exam. Not sure if she said to just wait until my next yearly exam but they didn't seem to concerned as they didn't schedule a follow up before I left. I've read that optomap isn't as thorough as dilation and maybe the picture just wasn't clear enough but also wasn't immediately concerning. Due to COVID I haven't been back and with rising cases in my area I'm hesitant to go back until things start to settle back down some hopefully after the holidays. Since it's been happening with no immediate affects on my vision I'm assuming it's not an urgent matter. Could this pain be eye strain/dry eye? Any other potential causes? "
9994,"20/20 is more like an average, not a maximum. "

9996,I'm a 23 year old male who has had strabismus from childhood. I went to an ophthalmologist to get an idea about the procedure. I have a 30 degree inward turn on my right eye I'd like to fix. My doctor did a few tests and told me that's she recommends a 20 degree fix in order to avoid double vision. Would aligning the eye completely cause me to have permanent double vision? Or will my brain get used to the new alignment of the eyes eventually? 
9997,"Thanks so much! Do you know when it starts to get noticeable? My old glasses didn't have this effect at all, the ones from 10 years ago. But my eyes got a lot worse in that time obviously (been wearing contacts exclusively for that time). "
9998,"You mean the entire eye being further away from the nose bridge than the other eye? In that case the difference is extremely slight and I'd agree with u/Kimeako to at least wait until 21. It could just grow out. If you're talking about being permanently cross-eyed, that can be corrected without surgery. "
9999,"I wear Accuvue 2 contacts abs replace them every two weeks. On the first day they're super comfortable all day, and as I get up around 12-14 days I find myself wanting eye drops 3-4 times/day. What's the difference? Is it damage to the contacts from wearing them, or cleaning them too roughly, or not cleaning them thoroughly, or something else? When I was a kid I was often comfortable in my monthly lenses for over a month, only replacing them when I realized it had been too long. I didn't wear them for a few years and now at forty I feel like they're not lasting like they should? "
10000,"Thank you very much for clarifying. Regarding point 3: My friend has gotten reading only glasses made by adding the sphere value (OD: +1.00 and OS: +0.25) with the ADD power of +1.50.

My friend's age is 50 and this prescription was taken around July 2020. Also, if there is no distance vision (nearsightedness) and If I were to make progressive lenses, then what is the distance value calculated as? "
10001,"Sorry for the delay... If your vision is getting worse, I would tend to agree with the recommendation for CXL (corneal cross linking). Another thing unrelated to keratoconus is presbyopia (the need for a reading prescription) which typically starts affecting things between ages 38 and 42. This is something that happens to 100% of humans. Whenever you second guess a doctor's recommendation, a second opinion is often helpful. "
10002,Oh okay gotcha I was 24 at diagnosis. 25 now. I am still at the age where progression is likely. Do you wear contacts or glasses? My right eye is a lot worse off so my left is overcompensating. ( although both eyes have Kc) I can still get by without any correction. Although I work from home and don't drive much at night or long distances where I don't know where I am going alone so that can also be a reason I don't wear my glasses often. interesting . I have a twin sister and she does NOT have KC. I use to rub my eyes and play with my eyes a lot when I was younger. I really think that did it for me. Sucks knowing that now.

10004,"Hi all, I am on three eye drops and last time I checked my IOP back in October it was 15 in both eyes. Since mid January I was feeling my vision was blurry, and one of my eyes the vision was a little cloudy. Initially I thought it was due to dry air in our new home, but I decided to go and see my doctor on Friday. It was scary! I have lost alot of my field of vision, and my IOP was 28 and 29 when I visited the first doctor in the morning. He immediately scheduled me for xen gel surgery in two weeks and gave me 500mg Acetazolamide in his office. I went for a second opinion in the afternoon, and the pressure had went up to 45 even with Acetazolamide. The second doctor recommend trab in three weeks. I am so scared. How could I lose so much field of vision in such a short time? What should I do? Which surgery is better? Xen gel or Trabeculectomy? "
10005,"obably due some combination of high glasses Rx, misalignment of optical center (vertically/horizontally), poor frame selection, lab defect and non adaptation to prescription change. I would advise that you find an That's a huge relief that they did no Damage. The doctor I have at current (Dr. J) kept my prescription very close to the original lenses I was on for 10 years, thank goodness, but there's clearly still a defect in the lenses themselves that is causing the blurry spots. Even DH was able to see the warped ripple areas through the lens, and he doesnt wear glasses .; Thanks for your feedback and assistance. I am hoping that when january rolls around and insurance resets, I can take the prescription to a better company. "
10006,I'm 25. Feb last year my eyes were sph -4.25 and now (18 months later) they're -5.0 I usually go down a step every 9 months. Everyone always says your eyes stop Changing in your 20s but mine clearly aren't. Anyone else the same? Anything I can do to help the stabilisation? 
10007,"Hi all :) 20F here! I was born with left upper eyelid ptosis. Having congenital ptosis throughout middle and high school was difficult, but in recent years I realize that I cannot see straight out of my eye or look up properly. The eyelid is just in the way. I started seeing an ophthalmologist (he performs reconstructive eyelid surgery) when I was about 9, which was when people started to notice my eyes weren't ""normal""<U+009D>. It's not like I was bullied for how I looked, but I knew I looked different and didn't like it. The doctor always told me that I would have the opportunity to get surgery to strengthen the muscle when I'm older and more developed. I noticed that sometimes when I'm tired, my eyelid will droop even more! Here I am, 20 years old, 6 months post eyelid reconstruction, and I am facing the same problem. That's right: I had surgery to raise my left eyelid (by strengthening the muscle that holds our eyelids) and it didn't work. It relapsed? Not sure what the word is but my eye is back to how it was before surgery. I honestly think it's worse. My parents don't see it as an issue (they think I'm being spoiled by asking for surgery) and now they're all like ""I told you so""<U+009D> about the outcome of the surgery. Anyway, my point is, does anyone have any solutions for congenital ptosis? I am interested in surgical, non-surgical, whatever can be done to raise my eyelid so I can see. I've seen oculoplastic surgery as a solution; what are other solutions that have worked for people with congenital ptosis? "
10008,"haha yes, small world, I lived in Beadnell for 11 years, I take it you suffered that bus before. I was 25 when I was diagnosed and I'm 35 now so it was actually 10 year ago not 7 (time just seems to disappear) I think I'll call my doctor rather than specsavers and try and get a referral back to the RVI , luckily I live in Newcastle now with a car so no more excuses lol.

10011,"I'm 33. My regular optometrist has always told me Costco does great with lenses, so I have always gone there and saved a lot of money. I was traveling recently and needed an emergency pair, so I went to a random optometrist who had good reviews. They told me they highly recommended Shamir Relax and talked about all these benefits it has, but I didn't understand half of what they were telling me. When I got home and asked my regular optometrist he said Shamir are good but any progressive from Costco will suit me just as well. Any suggestions? My info is: OD: -1.75, -1.00 x 010 OS: -5.0, -1.25 x 167 Add: +0.62 x .0u Do I spend more on Shamir or keep as it is? "
10012,"You are nearsighted and have astigmatism. Your nearsightedness means if you take your glasses off everything is clear that is about 8-10 feet away and closer. Your astigmatism though means that for things like reading and more fine details will not be clear for you at any distance. There is a focusing muscle in the eye that lets us focus on stuff up close. For you, when you wear your glasses and look at stuff about arms length and closer your focusing muscle has to do a little more work than if you took your glasses off because of your nearsightedness. However, the astigmatism is still there without your glasses so things won't be as clear. You will not be hurting your eyes by wearing your glasses all the time, the focusing muscle will adapt. However, when you start to get in your late 40's and on that muscle stops working as well and stuff at arms length and closer will become blurry for you, taking your glasses off at that point will help. Also blue blocking lenses have been shown to be a placebo. The amount of blue light we get from being outside for even 5 minutes is about 1000x more than what your computer can do in a day. Save your money, wear your glasses all the time if you want to! "
10013,"I know nothing about optometry but it seems what's tricky are the cylinder values?

Any recommendations? And forgive me if this sounds ignorant but if we can't find frames to fit this would it make much difference to have the 6.75 be adjusted to a lower number when making the lense? Thanks! "
10014,"So I have high myopia(pathological). Current script is -12ish(closer to 14 with astigmatism I think)? Buy it's fluctuating a bit atm due to cnvs and Avastin shots. But I don't think this deals with that. When I was a teenager (15 years ago) I noticed at night when I looked at indicator lights, like power surger lights, charging lights etc, without my glasses the light blooms and looks much larger, and in it I could see my floaters swirling and such. No big. Over time this has advanced though. A couple years ago, I noticed that I could see the lines in the tear film coating on my eye if I paused the eyelid for a moment when opening my eye. If I did this slowly, repeatedly, I could create ripples on the surface of my eye which I could see in the light. If an eyelash fell in my eye, I could see the root, and the shaft was see-through and hollow. I could see individual (larger)cells and drops of mucus on the surface of my eye. This includes the darker nucleus with a clear ring, followed by the cell wall. This has continued to progress. If I have a dark room with a mild light I can see the same type of stuff we looked at on microscope slides in high school. The most recent one is the weirdest thing though. So if I focus on my blind spots(from the cnvs), only one eye at a time though, and I try to relax my eyes, my vision kind of goes white and staticy. Then a new image fades in. At first it creeped me out, but now I think it's cool. It's a pinkish red color, kind of geometrically shaped with little triangles flapping rapidly (reminded me of worms at first lol, but they seem to be almost perfect triangles) along the edges of each shape. So kind of like a honeycomb with flapping triangles attached on each hexagon edge. And in the center of each shape is a black line which runs out of all of them into a network of black lines that slope out of sight. (Think of looking down a tunnel, but from off to the side.)so you can see the inside disappear from sight. Now this is the same in both eyes, though the perspective is subtly different in each. Based on the microscopic images I've looked at, I THINK I'm seeing the inside ring and edge of my iris. Well a section of it anyway. The tissue also expands and contracts subtly in time to my heart beat when I watch it. It's incredibly difficult to do, but I can repeat this, with enough time and effort, on demand. Sometimes I can even maintain the focus while blinking. Interestingly enough, I have had pretty significant flashing in the edges of my vision for several years now(at night). I assumed it was part of my visual decline. However I found out that when I let my vision fade back into normal, the flapping of the triangles gives way to the flashing. And I have had the tissue fade partially into view on accident when I have focused on the flashing when it's particularly annoying to me. I think it's the actual cause of the flashing! Its like my ""microvision"" and my normal vision are overlaying each other sometimes, and focus will flip back and forth. So, I'd like to know of other people who might be experiencing similar phenomena and more about the mechanics of it! Also confirmation of exactly what I see would be awesome. I also see static, and the blue sky dots(though I can see these at other times as well, not just blue). I mentioned this to my retina specialist and I think she thought I was a little cuckoo. However I do know there is precedent for this. It's just not talked about a whole lot. Sorry, long post, ik. "

10019,"I'm so glad you came here to post! We are in similar situations and we want to help. First, I've had great results with an anti-inflammatory diet. I hope you will give it a try--stay on it for 4 months or so to give it a chance. (I do see you said in a reply that you had tried cutting some foods down but didn't find it helpful. Would you consider giving it another try? I am 100% free of added sugars and gluten. I believe this is the reason I am doing well.) I really think counseling could help. Have you checked all community, sliding-scale, etc options? Is it definitely out of reach financially? Here is some material from a post I wrote earlier this year: I'm unhappy with my diagnosis, but I think hope is important. Here are some thoughts: (1) My GP says her other Sjogren's patients haven't had major problems. (2) My dental hygienist says most of her Sjogren's patients are doing fine. (3) My aunt, who is in her 80s, knows several people in her nursing home with Sjogren's. They all describe it as an inconvenience rather than a major problem. Note: these are people in their 80s! (4) My eyes are fine now (I've had good results with an anti-inflammatory diet), but when I first saw the ophthalmologist, I told him how scared I was. He said, ""We have SO MANY ways to help you!"" (5) Read the ""Xerostomia"" post from 3 days ago \[9 mos ago now\]. A dentist has developed a device (the Voutia) that trickles fluids into your mouth at normal salivation levels. That is going to be commercially available later this year. These kinds of devices will only become better, cheaper, and more common as time goes on. (6) As far as eye dryness and mouth dryness goes, people have these same problems for many, many reasons: age, medication, cancer treatments, etc. You are not just in the Sjogren's family of 1 to 4 million (in the US), you are also in the huge family of people who have these problems for other reasons. Lots of smart people are working on ways to help us. And that is why... (7) My rheum says they might have ways to repair our saliva glands in another ten years or so. REPAIR! I like the sound of that. (8) Finally: I really like this group, but when I got diagnosed my rheum said, ""Stay off the internet! If you \_have\_ to research your condition, do it with a few of the most reliable sources--Mayo, Cleveland Clinic, etc. Most people with Sjogren's do fine, and those people don't start blogs about their illness."" So consider the possibility that the internet--as wonderful as it is--is highlighting people's worst experiences. "

10021,"Does anyone else with 20/15 vision use glasses for distance reading like subtitles on a tv? I've been trying to find any info online but have been hard pressed to find any info or related experiences to mine. I recently went in to have a checkup because I noticed mid-distance reading of street signs or subtitles seems to be blurrier than usual. The optometrist told me I have great vision at 20/15 possibly due to sports since childhood and said it would not be necessary to have glasses and what I am experiencing is a contrast of having had even better vision which had slightly deteriorated over time. They did say I could have a slight correction but that I really didn't need it and that when I was in a theater, it could have been a problem with the quality of the projection for example. I thought maybe it could be something atmospheric also but I was recently trying to read a tv channel listing from about 12-15 feet away and felt it was still blurry. So it seems to be a similar occurrence with digital or analog forms of text indoors and outdoors. I have family who say they were also told they had also been told they had ""very good"" vision via tests but still need glasses for reading up close which is the opposite in my case.

10028,"Hello friends! I've been lurking a bit for tips and tricks and thought I would introduce myself here. I'm a prime contender for any and all autoimmune issues. Just about everyone in my immediate family has something, from extrinsic asthma to Crohn's to ankylosing spondylitis. I believe that my particular issue is Sjogren's thanks to my lifelong issues with dry eyes/mouth/skin/etc. In fact, every single strange quirk of my body throughout my life is also a clear sign of Sjogren's, plus my genetic predilection. In fact, I discovered Sjogren's as a possibility while I was looking for solutions for my very dry eyes and skin. However, my blood and urine panel came back entirely clear with no cause for concern except that I might drink a bit too much water (guess why?) and Kaiser doesn't offer early Sjogren's panels. This is exactly what happened to my mom when she was about my age -- I'm 44 -- and five years later she was calling me from a hospital bed to tell me that her kidneys were shutting down and no one knew why. It wasn't until that point that her own autoimmune dysfunction showed up on her blood test! (She lived and eventually recovered and is happy and healthy with the occasional infusion, but I hope to not get to that point before my own diagnosis or all-clear.) Oh yeah, in the last year food had lost its taste, I had lost an alarming amount of weight, was having mood swings like crazy and was dizzy and forgetful all the time and my hands and feet were tingling. Once I started eating food with more liquid in it my personality came roaring back, and it was all because my vanity led me to look for ways to treat my dry skin and eyes. Also, since 2017 I've had this weird recurrent issue in my right hand when I'm under enormous stress in which two of my fingers, always the same fingers, swell up and turn all sorts of interesting colors as though they are infected, but there is no infection. It didn't occur to me that might be Reynaud's until I started researching; it was clearly AI dysfunction at some point but my doctor and I had thought it was something else, Well's syndrome, because it doesn't come on and disappear within hours -- it sticks around for weeks and fades very gradually. WWhile I am being cautious about stating outright that I have Sjogren's without a diagnosis from a health care professional, it seems pretty clear to me that something is going on given my symptoms -- many of which have been lifelong but which didn't really start escalating until 2017, the year I turned forty. So I guess I'm looking for ways to get an early Sjogren's panel so that I can either definitively rule it out or get a diagnosis and tips on how to advocate for myself. It makes little difference to my lifestyle except that I've quit drinking (it was making me feel like shit anyway, easy enough to do) and changed up my diet, aka I started eating again. I've also started to regard these strange times when I'm exhausted and overwhelmed by life in general as ""flares"" rather than depressive episodes, which I thought they were for the longest time. It's such a weird weight off. Anyway, I guess any tips for advocating for myself would be appreciated! Thank you! "

This area is typically where the heat from the central air would flow to try to exit the room. I know this wasn't something in my eyes because I turned my head a couple times and it didn't follow my line of sight but remained in the corner of the room.

10041,"**Some quick background:** Hello! For the longest time I used to exclusively wear contacts but since I'm mostly at home during these times and I got a fully remote job, I decided to get a pair of glasses. For a bit of reference, I'm 24 and while I did mostly use contacts like I mentioned, I did use my VERY old pair of glasses I got when I was in middle school (which were pretty weak but decent enough) and I had no issues. Now here's the problem with my new glasses. When I look at something dead straight, it's perfect but the things at the edge of the glasses look kind of curved. Like when I look at my fridge, the handles which are at eye level look fine, but if I just move my eyes a bit up or down, it feels like the fridge is kind of curved towards me. Similarly, if I have something like a bottle on a table and my head is above the bottle but I move my eyes to look down at the bottle and move my head left and right, it feels like the bottle is being stretched the direction I'm looking at. Another example is that when I have my dinner plate on the table and I move my eye down to look at it, it literally looks like an oval until I move my head and look directly at it, and then it looks like a circle. The other issue I have is that for some reason if I look at super black/white things from any corner of my glasses, I see some weird blue/orange outline. I googled this and it seems to be due to the light being bent and is due to the material of my glasses? I honestly thought that all glasses are the same and only the frame is different so I got a pretty cheap pair, should I have gone for a more expensive one? Any help is appreciated! I'm not sure if this is something that'll fix itself over time but this is my second day with it and seeing things being curved and distorted when I look at it from one angle or another is not fun at all... Otherwise, should I return these and get another pair? **PS**: The new pair I got is one of those oval shapes and kind of ""oversized"" where my old pair was small and square if it matters. "

What I've found odd is that it only happens when playing games and not when I'm on my computer for classes or when I'm on my phone. I've started using my dads reading glasses which are 1.25 magnification and they've helped limit it but I'd like to be able to play without them. I have an appointment with my eye doctor but it's not till January, so any advice that may be able to help would be appreciated. "

10045,"I have found relief from ALL symptoms by doing twice daily eye hygiene along with using tea tree oil on the lid and lash line. This is a DILUTED solution 1:10 tea tree oil:water (other vehicle). Using a QTip, after cleansing, smooth a very slight application on the lid to the lash line... as well as my entire face (I usually got some stinging going in the eye; but not too bad) I have not had ANY flare up in months.

10047,"Hi there, I'm a 20 year old male who has recently started experiencing a few vision symptoms, and I am wondering if you guys think I should bring up worries on possible keratoconus? I went to an optometrist for all of this, though he mostly just prescribed me normal lenses with a prism now, and didn't actually read the symptoms the nurse wrote down (Which is my bad, i should have brought it all up again, due to the fact doctor's don't usually read the notes.) But also I've heard the test for Keratoconus is a corneal topography, which, looking at those machines, I haven't seen anything like it nor did they use it on me, just the normal machines for getting prescriptions like I have gotten all the time. Basically I know he didnt read the notes because he was about to send me home with normal prescription lenses until I mentioned double vision, after which he decided to test with prisms and stuff, so I don't think he got the full information. My prescription also jumped from -8 to -11 despite previously having no change for a year, and it's definitely been getting worse with vision over the last year or two. But I have an appointment again on Monday for me to actually bring up all the symptoms, and I'm wondering if it would be a good idea bringing the possibility of Keratoconus to the table? Basically, it started around a week or so ago when I woke up and felt like the vision, especially in my right eye was weird. My left eye seemed somewhat fine, but something felt really off about my right eye suddenly. I had been rubbing my eye a lot lately before then, and it was only really then that I realized it also felt like there was something stuck in my eye, though it's intermittent, which has continued despite rushing to the ER and them telling me theres nothing in my eye, and my eye has no scratches. The reason I went to the ER is that a couple nights later I noticed a bit of double vision in my right eye, which I had never noticed before, so I got that checked out, and they said it was nothing they could see there, and to go to an opthamologist. There's also been the intermittent feeling of something stuck in my eye, but the double vision has gotten a bit worse over the past week, it's basically, first it was only on white text on black backgrounds, seeing that text stacked on top of itself but it was like a ghost. Now it seems to be rising higher, and happens with stuff like my finger, and on colored text and objects and black text on white backgrounds too, so it seems to be getting worse. I've also been getting a bit of eye pain, but mostly resulting in headaches, which I think is due to the eye strain, probably. I also get streaks down from light, and it seems to make it real hard to see past when the light is streaking down my vision, such as walking at night and being near a street lamp, there's streaks of the light down my vision. It gets a bit better if I open my eyes super wide though. Not to mention large halos around bright objects like traffic lights at night. It's also seemed like I can see less at night than I used to, and doing something like looking through my phone camera makes a huge difference compared to what I'm able to actually see. It's definitely worse in my right eye, though my left eye seems to be getting worse too. At first it seemed like the double vision in my left eye went away with blinking, but it now seems constant, though not at the same level as my right eye. Basically, I'm wondering if it's a good idea to bring the concerns of keratoconus up to the optometrist on monday, or if thats just a stupid idea, and I'm overthinking? "
10048,Yes I've met many people of all ages with high myopia without complications. I was a -10 myself before having refractive surgery. You can definitely live a normal life but I would avoid contact sports such as martial arts or any activity where you can get eye injury.

10052,"In my experience, I cannot stop a flare once it's started with anything. Sometimes a heavy duty dose of prednisone will stop it from getting worse/staying around longer. Prevention is key for me, and I've found over the years (diagnosed at 27, currently 41) that what I eat matters in a huge way. Sugar (including from honey and maple syrup) makes things for me worse so I try and limit those things to the extreme. I'm also personally off any nightshades, and anything with msg in it.. but everyone has to work out what helps personally. Decent sleep patterns, stress management and symptom tracking can also really help. Sometimes comfort food is awesome, sometimes it can make you feel worse/more lethargic. But track that, and any other symptoms (including cycle when female) and talk to your docs about any questions. The more information you have the more you can be prepared, the more you may be able to prevent. Good luck! "
10053,Age: 26 Gender: female Weight: 140 Height: 5ft Yesterday morning I was laying next to my child and I guess my head was too close to his and he decided to turn his head around and it bonked me hard right in the eye. I went to the optometrist who took a photo of the back of my eyes and even looked at them and said that they looked fine when I read up on retinal detachment I find that a blunt force can cause it. I feel like that would be considered blunt force but the doctor said it wasn't. He was kind of quick when answering my questions and was really quick to tell me there wasn't anything wrong with my eye. I can see fine out of it and it doesn't hurt or anything like that. Did I just get extremely lucky or is getting punched/bonked in the eye by a baby's big head not enough to cause damage to my eye? Or was the doctor just being extremely dismissive? Anyone have experience with this kind of thing?

10056,"Since 2019 I suffer from recurrent keratitis. Especially in the months from February to August (pollen season, I suffer from allergy), I develop painful symptoms that has been vaguely described as marginal keratitis or infiltrates by eye doctors. Symptoms are mostly unilateral, but involve both eyes at different times; they can appear as often as 3 times per month in the period indicated above. They feel like touching the cornea with a finger all the time, until they heal. Healing can take from 3 days to 1 week (in the sense that the burning sensation goes away). This all started after a sexual harassment that caused a proven genital infection by herpes simplex virus. Despite my clear history, no eye doctor has been willing to do appropriate testing of my eye and they refuse to define it as ""herpetic"" for the simple reason that it does not have a dendritic shape. The correlation with the herpes infection is high in my opinion and I can't think of anything else than an infectious nature; I have never been to an eye doctor in my 35 years of life before this event, which proves that the trigger for this event is related to the harassment. My other herpes symptoms are also active; in the face region I get chronic inflammations of my upped lip, localized always in the same area. From reading books and websites on ophthalmology specialized on keratitis, I'm well aware that herpes can cause marginal corneal ulcers and stromal corneal infiltrates, that are non dendritic. Furthermore, the golden diagnosis for this condition is corneal scrapings / debridement followed by PCR on the samples, which has never been done to me. It makes me upset that all the eye clinics of my city use the criteria ""dendritic / not dendritic"" to discriminate what is herpetic from what is not. What is your opinion / experience? This is a picture of my eye today. You can see the clouding of the cornea in the lower region, with some elevated round regions (brighter white spots) and corneal injections. https://preview.redd.it/wscxzzmet0n61. jpg? width=1167&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e66515774e065af947411217a043a282bf8311f5.

10058,"Yes, I have seronegative Sjogren's and experience many of your symptoms. I actually come up with the anti-centromere antibody but my doc dismissed it so I had the lip biopsy done to get my diagnoses. I played this game of dryness starting around age 40 and thought it was due to low omega 3s and hormone changes. My labs were always negative but I kept drying out more and more and my neurological, hormonal, and musculoskeletal systems all need(ed) medicinal support to keep me going. It wasn't until I read the sjogren's.org list of symptoms and saw I had most of them, that I felt empowered enough to push for a diagnoses. All those years I spent feeling ill and the only thing that helped stabilize me was taking LDN, multiple hormone replacement meds, and adhering to a low-carb diet. It's been so damn frustrating! I suggest that you work on taking care of your dryness/mouth for now, even if your doc says no to Sjogren's. The key to a healthy mouth is making enough saliva to keep your teeth clean/mouth healthy! Ask your doc for pilocarpine to help with salivation. Ask your dental hygienist/dentist for tips/treatment. "
10059,"I've been since little diagnosed with the lazy eye condition. They gave me prescription glasses to ""correct"" the problem, but I was afraid of looking weird and being judged by the kids at school.. so I would not use the eyeglasses. When I was older, around 15 years old, I noticed how the problem would get worse, especially when doing activities close to my eyes (such as reading, drawing, etc), when stressed, or when I do or think of something with much concentration. My insurance would only cover the lousiest plastic glasses that would not help me at all. Aside of ugly. I couldn't afford the glass ones. I never could go to an eye therapist because my insurance also did not cover it and it was very expensive. I did not like using an eye patch because my vision on the only open eye would get black or be grainy as a tv that has no signal. If I remember correctly, it would get in a corner and then take over my vision. I could see also the letters when reading and objects but could not process the information. I felt numb in what I was seeing; so I didn't really use the eyepatch. Sometimes I get worried now a days, because it can get very bad. There are days that I have no or minimal problems. But I'm afraid of it sometimes getting worse like when ie driving (I can close one eye and get over it, but still; sometimes [rarely] when I close one of my eyes I can all of a sudden have like a small black spot that disturbs my vision that later goes away a few seconds later). I used to move my head upwards or sideways and it would go away, but now... it doesn't really work anymore, and the duplicate image I see is stronger than what it was ie 5-8 years ago.

Generally computer glasses are just like reading glasses with your add power (or the amount of diopters that must be added to your distance prescription to view objects up close) cut in half.

10071,"First of all, thanks so much for taking the time to click on this. I'll try to make this succinct! I'm a 36/M. Back in Nov of 2020, I suddenly noticed something weird in the inner corner of my left eye while going on a walk. Like, whenever shrubs/grass passed through a certain part of my field of vision, they would get distorted and smudged. Kind of like here: [https://i.imgur.com/O41v0U6. gif](https://i.imgur.com/O41v0U6. gif) I kind of just let it go for a while, but later that day I noticed it just wasn't going away. I noticed when I looked at bright/white surfaces, I could see kind of a dark/static tentacle in my vision. I actually made this drawing in photoshop so I could better explain it to my doctors (note the tentacle in the bottom left): [https://i.imgur.com/bKudSpg. png](https://i.imgur.com/bKudSpg. png) This shadow/tentacle has been persistent in my vision. Also I should note, when I close my eyes after look at a bright light, the tentacle is kind of ""lighter"" and visible with closed eyes. A day later after discovering this, I went to the Optometrist and they said they noticed a cotton wool spot in my left eye that could have ben the cause and wanted to continue to monitor it. Fast forward a few months later to February 2021, the cotton wool spot is pretty much gone and the distortion has calmed down a bit, but is still definitely persistent. This is where it gets really weird. Probably from Jan/Feb 2021 until now (May 31), often times when I hear a sudden sound, the scotoma/tentacle will suddenly LIGHT UP with various colors. Sometimes white, sometimes red, sometimes a combination, maybe depending on the sound? This is SUPER extra disturbing when I'm trying to sleep or have my eyes closed, because I will see a scary/colorful flash (only where the shape is) in my left eye. I was trying to use meditation to deal wit the stress of it, but this symptom kind of prevents me from doing that anymore. Ever since I've noticed this, I have done the following: * CAT Scan of my brain/eyes/head/neck * I have had 2 ophthalmologists look at my eye with a crazy thing that scans my retina (forget what it's called) * Angiogram of my left eye * Visual field test All of it looked normal for the most part, but these are some things to note: * The ophthalmologist who did the angiogram said one of my optic nerves is larger than the other and asked me if I have family history of glaucoma. (I don't) * The visual field test resulted in slightly reduced vision in the area of complaint (tentacle in the inner corner of my left eye). It kind of sucks, and I know there are worse things in the world, but it really freaks me out that the scotoma(?) lights up whenever I hear sudden sounds. I'm aware of the existence of synesthesia, however only on the scotoma? I didn't have this before and I strongly feel that it's not normal. I'm just trying to figure out what's going on. Thanks so much for reading. "

Rub gently for 20 seconds. 4. Rinse the lens under a gentle stream of the solution for 5 seconds (edited and corrected!) 5. Insert the lens. It doesn't sting for me at all. (First time ever!) 6. Wash, rinse and air dry the case. This is so much easier than having to use multiple solutions. Stay safe, KC people! "
10078,"So inspired by the ""When have you saved a life"" thread, I thought I'd tell my quick experience with the most amazing optometrist in my life. This guy worked under an Ophthalmologist; not as a direct boss afaik, just as the ""check-up guy"" after surgeries and such, to make sure the surgeon wasn't needed during recovery. I was about 17 at the time, and I had severe keratoconus. It wasn't advanced, as far as KC goes (in a lifetime), but it was one of the most quickly degenerating he'd seen, in someone at 17 (knowing it started about 15; i was already in -4 glasses, lost 50% of the chart in 6 months, and previously had 20/15 vision). The TLDR of all of this, is that for me? A teen who wanted to be a programmer and suddenly couldn't read screens? My life was over. (my 'backup plans' were pilot, or long haul truck driver; also gone!) I'd seen probably ten optometrists, trying to find one who could fit a KC sufferer with... anything, including a specialist for RGP lenses (MiniScleral didn't exist yet); and sadly my pain levels were too great for them to be fitted. Every optometrist... ""This is a very advanced condition...."" Every ophthalmologist.... ""These are your future risk factors...."" Every specialist..... ""These are your only option, wear them...."" Finally; I met this guy. He walked an elderly lady out of his office, holding her hand, and being very hyper-polite, official, exactly how you expect a TV 'doctor' to behave. ""Great...."" I thought, another 'doctor' to tell me I have a degenerative eye disease, woohoo.... I get seen next, and we sit down; Rather than throw machines in front of me right away he spends 5 minutes just chatting (in hindsight, assessing my personality)... This literally saved my life. He realised he didn't need to put on an 'act' for me, we clicked right away like friends, and it was truly emotional magic. We get to the point of measuring and refracting, and his response is literally: ""Maaaate, your eyes are FUCKED!"" I laughed, and said ""Yep!"" ""No, like, really fucked up, Jesus! And you're what, 18? mate.... you have **no idea**...."" ""I might have some idea"", I replied putting on an exaggerated squint ""Yeah, OK, true, but man...."" At this point, I'm already completely disarmed by the feeling of pseudo 'just talking to a mate I grew up with' then, the magic sentence. **""Fuck it, that's what you've got? Lets fix it""** For a teen, a near suicidal teen, who felt like life had ended, who had been told repeatedly that this is a ""serious condition"" and spoken to like a lab rat at every meeting, this ""fixed me"" near instantly. I had a **brother-in-arms**, someone who told me we were going to **fight back**, not prepare for the worst and just dull the blow. Sadly, refracting me the traditional way proved impossible; but I was offered to ""Fiddle with the machine"" on his lunch break. ""If you don't mind me chattin' to my wife on the phone, you can tweak this, and this, and see what you find"" Showing me how to flip the lens, and rotate the axis. It took about 20 minutes of work on the axis alone, and I found one.... (mathematically, a bad one, my Axis creates a triangle, but it 'worked' somehow) ""I can read the bottom line....."" ""Honey, I have to go, my patients are *lying* to me, [click]. Prove it"" Another 15 minutes later, and I had a prescription. This took probably 2 hours of what felt like 'hanging out'. I have since written him a letter, years later, and explained how much he truly saved me. I wanted to share this because I'm **SURE** some people here will be squirming in their professionalism-boots, at someone swearing, over-acting, and at times genuinely laughing, *at* a patient... But when the weight of the world is pushing on you, adding to the pile, even if it's an *accurate* addition, isn't always helpful. Different doctors, specialists, optometrists, exist because different people exist, it's not all about education, there are times when personality is the golden ticket. While being as risky as my example above might be too much (especially in America, I visited twice, you fellas are *sensitive* to swearing, lol); don't be afraid to be a person. Especially to a customer who is trying to be 'themselves'. Odds are good they're trying to connect, and they probably need someone right now. "
10079,"Hello! I am a nearsighted guy, since I was 13/14 years old. Lately I began wondering how much environnemental factors counted in, because at that age I used to live a pretty healthy life. Later on I began to get not really great habits, but that didn't blatantly affect my prescription, which increased gradually and 'normally' in my teens. Now it is still considered mild myopia (i am about -2 something). Since I was 17, it stabilised (now I am 20). In my family there are some people who are myopic as well.

First, a little background: I've worn glasses since I was 3 years old (32 years total) so at this point in my life, I have a good idea of what works for me. That said, I'm open to an unbiased opinion. Whenever I update my glasses, I typically purchase two pairs: everyday use and sun glasses. For the everyday use, I typically use a digital (or HD... forgive my ignorance of the marketing vs. practical term) high index lenses (1.74). Same applies for the sunglasses although I have been told the highest refractive index available to me for polarized lenses is 1.67. Am I making the right choices here? Should I consider something different? When I first tried the digital lenses, I did notice an improvement so I've stuck with them. I've always wondered if I was getting ripped off, though, because the price points are fairly high. Rx is as follows: * \-8.00 -1.50 x 155 * \-8.75 -0.50 x 75 My usual vendor is Pearle Vision. I'm not beholden to them, but they know my history and I've never really had any issues. Thanks much. "

10089,"Hello triage, last month I had an annual comprehensive eye exam at an OD's office in my home town. They have been seeing me for one year so they know what the situation was exactly a year ago. Well at the exam the OD told me that my eyesight had slipped slightly from 20/20 but that she didn't recommend changing my lenses unless they were damaged. When I asked her about what the ""score""<U+009D> was or whatever it's called she brushed me off and just said it was slight. I've been led to believe that decreasing vision before age 40 is typically pathological in nature. I effectively have one eye so this is very important to me. Since the appointment I've been noticing that I cannot see things far away as sharply as I once could (as soon as last year) and I'm having some strange light refraction errors too. I guess my question is this: if the OD did a full physical exam (dilated eyes, refraction tests, everything except visual field testing) is there anyway they could miss something like RP, Glaucoma, or macular degeneration? (And I know I should get an appointment with an ophthalmologist, I already did. I have to wait though.). "

I am currently wearing contacts but 90% of the time for the past month I've been wearing my glasses a lot more because of the eye problems. I wear the Bausch and Lomb ultra astigmatism contacts when I do wear them. I've been having a problem with my left eye recently where it's slightly elevated pressure but my eye dr thinks it was because I was using prednisone drops and it raised the pressure or it could be allergies. I'm really scared about my eyes because I've never had problems with them beside having to wear contacts and glasses! Help! I'm only 27 so I really don't want to go blind. And my eye dr said I'm probably not gonna go blind but I'm just scared since it's my eyes you know. Should I call my eye drs after hours hotline about this and see what they recommend? or wait till Monday I'm just scared of my vision getting worse quickly. My vision is not necessarily blurry but maybe out of focus so maybe it is blurry I just can't tell idk. 
10091,"TLDR: Had no issues wearing lenses almost everyday all day for 10 years. Recently eyes get very dry & irritated. Need to use eye drops & limit lens usage. Was told lasik would help. Not sure why my eyes react like this when they were fine for 10 years I (22F) have been wearing daily disposable contacts (acuvue) for almost 10 years since the 8th grade. I wore them almost daily, 6 days a week, & would wear them from when I woke up to when I went to bed as I am a very active person. Never had an issue with dryness or irritation. Never used eye drops. Recently in August 2020 I tried 2 week & monthly contacts (also acuvue) & started experiencing irritation & my eyes would get dry very easily. I started using eye drops & wouldn't make it a whole work day without taking my contacts off. Now the irritation & dryness has persisted. My eyes now get dry even when wearing daily disposable contacts. I can wear them for an entire day but after taking them off my eyes will show a lot of veins & feel super dry. To combat this I now only wear contacts when exercising & only wear them all day once a week. I got a consultation for lasik & was told that I would be a good candidate as I have thick corneas. I was told it would help with the dryness. I really find glasses annoying & would really like a solution. Has anyone else experienced this or something similar? Do you have any solutions or advice? Did lasik help your dryness? Any help, advice, and/or solutions would be greatly appreciated! "
10092,I wanted to make this post to ease some people's minds who may need a CXL Epi-off procedure done. After reading some posts I was very worried about the pain following the surgery. I am currently typing this at 7 PM having gotten the procedure done earlier this morning. The first 1-3 hours post op were painful (maybe a 6-7/10) but i feel very good now. I would consider the pain a 3/10. I am currently taking hydrocodone so I'm sure that's helping as well. I would also add I have a decently high pain tolerance. I know pain levels vary with different people but I'm surprised and pleased I'm not in more pain. Now I'm just praying it doesn't randomly get more painful in the next few days haha. Just wanted to make this post so hopefully some people aren't as worried as I was going into the procedure!! 
10093,"Hello. I'm a writer. It's how I live, and how I get paid. I did a topolink and CXL procedure (athen protocol) about 5 weeks ago (surgery on March 2). I'm 38 and I had advanced stage of KC, but my eyes were doing fairly well. The disease was no longer progressing for about a year. I was reading 15/20 and 20/20. A bit of irregular astigmatism that was annoying because even with glasses it didn't correct well. I saved up and went with a reputable surgeon. At 5 weeks post off both eyes read now 20/20 on the charter. Yet that is what it says, but not how I feel. An awful amount of ghosting are exhausting my patience. Reading is tough, with letters feeling way more fuzzy than before. I'm extremely photosensitive. Outside is hell, inside is tough. Hard to do screen time. Falling behind very badly with work. The ghosting is strong, re-reading myself is difficult. One moment the screen reads ok, the next second it's a glowing sludge with letters breathing in and out of focus... Constant variations. Tons of halos and starlight effects when driving, especially at night... some haze I guess. A constant veil or layer of very diffuse fog... I guess that's also the ghosting. My eyes always feeling tired. A lot of strain, it still hurts in one of them, like a flesh wound. Follow up said I was fine. I suppose the eye that struggle more being the one that sees better, it tries to over-correct the other one. Bottom line it's hard to read and go on with life. I certainly don't enjoy working anymore which is a shame. Hard to focus. Harder to write, not to say I haven't I can't even manage to finish a page now. Headache and migraines also now. I'm being told it's normal and most people need 3 to 6 months to fully recover. That everyone being different the healing time can vary, but that overall most do very well by a year mark no matter what, unless you're one of the complication. They say I'm not a complication. That the epithelium is re-growing uniformly and that it looks good. I guess I'm loosing my mind then? Anyone been there? Am I a complication? Is this normal? How long until you're back to baseline? How can I head faster. Mostly... Will I ever stabilize? All I want is for the side effect to go away and my vision to stabilize so I can keep my eyes on something for more than 3 sec without feeling like I need to close them. I don't need to see better, but just like before the surgery, so I can go back to reading and writing. I'm worried for my carrier and my life. A little bit of optimism and perspective would come a long way. Unless I'm truly doomed... this is a bit frightening. I wish I knew. "

10100,"Hello! First time poster as I had no idea this even existed up until less than 24 hours earlier. I went in to get my eyes checked for new glasses as I haven't had a proper examination since 2017 and came out with this diagnosis. The intern was doing the work on my eyes, but for whatever reason anything she tried to do my left eye wasn't able to see anything clearly. She wound up bringing in the main doctor who did some tests on me. She lifted up my eyelid and had me look at the floor and then proceeded to have me do another eye test. I guess this test was x-raying my cornea or something? The paperwork showed that my right cornea looks like a dot, but my left looks like a smudge. Upon completion of my exam, she booked me out glasses that she told me wouldn't really help and made an appt for me to get sceptal (sp?) contact lenses next week. Now, here's my question.

The new glasses made me throw up and I couldn't do it anymore so we agreed to revert back to the numbers shown above. I got a top of the line pair of lenses from her with digital and premium AR. Now that I'll be replacing the lenses back I want to possibly not throw money at it since I already did that once. Any idea on if digital is really necessary or marginally better at this level? I keep seeing Abbe value. I've looked it up but still have no idea what that means. Ideally I'd like lenses that let in a lot of light since I've found sometimes things are darker with glasses on.

Don't feel guilty for being upset. It's your vision, and this disease sucks, it's frustrating, and it's way worse than just needing glasses. I think we're allowed to be bummed. I let my eye health lapse in my mid to late 20s because of a variety of issues too. I'm now almost certainly too thin in my right eye to get CXL, but on the positive side at 32 it appears the progression may have stopped for now in both eyes. So hopefully it will naturally slow it's progression for you, which I think it normally does as you get a bit older! My hope is just to be able to be good with sclerals as long as possible so I can put off needing a transplant. edit: I also 100% agree with getting a second opinion, if it's possible.

10109,"Ask for the Schirmer eye test, as It took me 10 years of runaround from every doctor and dentist I have before I finally got a diagnosis. The eye doctor my RA referred me to for the aforementioned test looked at the damage to my corneas (cataracts at a younger age is also a good indication of Sjogren's), and he didn't need to do the actual Schirmer test. He diagnosed me with Sjogren's on the spot. If your doctors and dentist don't diagnose you, make sure they treat you ""as if""<U+009D> you had Sjogren's. Because the treatments are still fairly vague for the actual condition. I recommend: 1. Asking your dentist for fluoride treatments and more frequent cleanings (if you can afford the ludicrous prices). 2. Getting prescription fluoride toothpaste. 3. Drinking sugar-free fluids and keeping Spry mints in every room, office, etc. 4. Have your doctor consider adding Sicca syndrome to your medical history.

10117,"Hello luv, I am a former wearer of contacts (since I was eleven or twelve, so almost twenty years). My prescription was a biggie, -11.50 with some cyl. I got ICL (lens in muh eyeballs) surgery, so I'm glasses and contacts free now yee! BUT I manage an optometrists office and have been for over six years, so I can probably give you some personal and professional experience in this area. Firstly, prescriptions on your eye, contacts, have no vertex distance. (distance between the prescription and your eye) Glasses do. As you go up in prescription, especially over -4.00 the prescription between glasses and contacts can vary based on that distance. Imagine a magnifying glass and how when you move it closer or farther away to something how the size and clarity changes. Remember too how when you look through a magnifying glass you look through the center right? The outer edges have some distortion, this will go up significantly the cheaper the material. Think of a magnifying glass as a plus prescription, your Rx is a minus prescription. Your glasses lens is doing kindof the opposite of what a magnifying glass does. This vertex distance combined with your higher Rx is going to explain why things look smaller and give you a fish bowl effect. After I got glasses again as a contact lens wearer for years, I nearly fell over with how weird they felt. It took a lot of getting used to, my brain was NOT used to seeing through a lens that far from my eye. I would still get headaches if I wore them too long as well. The combined weight of my glasses, with the work my brain had to do from switching to contacts, then glasses, then contacts etc was a lot and fatigue, just like when you work any muscle, will happen.A great analogy I always loved I heard from a former doctor I used to work for was:think of a rubber band on your wrist how it makes impressions on your arm after long use, but it fades after a while. Contacts sit ON your eye and create something similar with impressions on the eye. As your eye shape changes it can change how the light reflects into the back of the retina, which can affect the clarity with which you see. So image how if you're wearing contacts then putting on glasses and your eye (like the wrist) starts to revert to a shape without the contact (or rubber band) indent. What some people forget to remember is, we see with our brain, not with our eyes. If your brain remembers ten years of looking through something one way, it will take an adjustment to relearn that, and every time you switch it, it will have to relearn it again. The higher and more complicated your prescription (high myopia - rx's, high cyl, added prism) the more difficult those adaptations can be. This is another reason why doctors want patients to be out of contacts for a few weeks before they have Lasik, or ICL surgery, they want correct rx's and eye surfaces that are less likely to fluctuate. As a chronic contact lens wearer you should try and wear glasses occasionally if you can. Your eyes love oxygen, and they will get the most oxygen when there isn't a piece of ""plastic"" on your eye. The more oxygen will reduce swollen blood vessels, and promote tear production. Every time you blink moisture washes over the eye, with a contact it's not getting as much of those natural tears. As far as lens materials, manufacturers, buying online. If you have a simple rx. say a child with a -.25 sph prescription and they break their glasses all the time or lose them every month! Go for it, buy online, they probably wont notice any difference because they aren't as heavily reliant on a small distortion or change. For someone like myself, and I would recommend you, that had a higher RX, I would recommend going to an optician trained to take custom measurements so that you get that ocular center and pupillary distance exact. The more variances in a prescription the more you're going to want those to be very precise for clear vision when you'd be basically nonfunctional without vision correction. hehe I know the fun stumbling through the night blind when you dont have your contacts in. Discount retailers may offer hi index materials (thinner like 1.67 etc), but bear in mind, not all materials are created equal. The wide variety of plastics and lens technology ranges from the lowest of the low (online retail, Walmart, etc) to custom measured and digitally manufactured lens with a power accuracy within 1/100th of your prescription, compared to 1/8th with traditional surfacing. This improves clarity as thousands of points across the lens are optimized for your prescription. Especially in situations like ours it is essential to ensure that all measurements and fittings are precise for optimal vision. A more premium lens brand like Zeiss is constantly researching new technology to make the clearest vision, mathematically calculated and digitally ground into the lens taking into account all the measurements and variables of a prescription. They are also the same manufacturers of the lens in the hubble telescope and they work with makers of halogen lightbulbs to develope anti-reflective coatings that cut down on night driving glare etc. I'm blown away by the thought and technology that premium manufacturers put into their lenses, but that kind of tech and research and benefit as well as the personal attention an optician gives to your fit and measurements and prescription are why the cost is higher than an online retailer. There is a reason they can charge such a lower amount. They're buying in bulk, cheaper plastics, less optimized, less clarity and you're doing the measurements yourself. Imagine grabbing a dollar store pair of reading glasses compared to an HD television. Remember how I said that eye shape can change the way the light hits your eye and therefore effect your vision? Just as when you look to the side of a lens, the light is hitting your eye at a different angle. When you get a refraction at the doctors office and he sits you in the chair and you tell him which lenses are clearer ""A or B"" etc. you're looking straight ahead. The best Rx is determined for the ocular center of your glasses because that is where you are going to look through most regularly. No lenses are perfect and in order to get that clarity in a point in your lenses especially for us higher myopes the lenses get REAL thiccc : p on the outside. That could be giving you fishbowl and distortions. As well as, well, your eye is turned, the light is hitting it different than when you sat in the chair and looked straight on at the doctors office and told him ""yep that's clear"". Every point in the lens is going to require some part of a different rx because it's not in the same position as the very center, the light is hitting your retina in a different area. With premium, digital lenses those formulas that labs and lens manufacturers use to put your rx into the lens are verrrrry complex and they try and take into account those eye movement changes. Again, not perfect, and I'm no physics master, so I hope I'm not being too confusing, but phenomenally better than an online retailer that is trying to mass produce lenses as quick as possible for the highest profit. Maybe another analogy would be like, a suit tailor verses a walmart suit. The more complicated your request, walmart would try it's best to get you a suit that ""fit"" but a tailor is probably going to get a lot closer. I usually try and help people shopping for glasses take into perspective if you're wearing glasses full time you're going to be using those glasses more than you use your phone or car, so investing in a quality pair is going to make you a lot happier. If you're wearing them part time, as I did, because I preferred contacts, you can probably get away with a lesser product, BUT you're gunna have those adjustment periods every time you switch from contacts, and that distortion is going to be more pronounced because of surfacing processes and materials. Even my most premium pair of glasses I still had some fish bowl and distortion and the objects appearing smaller, that's normal with high prescriptions. Your eyes may eventually get used to it, more likely if you wore them full time no contacts. But, ultimately we ""see"" with our brain and some people have more sensitivity, notice more details, adapt differently. What works for one person, may not work for you. **TLDR:** It's normal, kinda. Blurry, fuzzy vision, double vision- have the doc recheck your rx, straight lines when looking straight ahead being curved- your astigmatism may be off, rainbows around things- polycarbonate material sensitivity or bad to no antireflective coating, pulling sensation- your pd could be off. Even something as small as glasses adjustments can change how you see clear in your glasses. Slight fishbowl effect and smaller objects on a high myopic patient (like you and me) pretty normal. Switching from contacts to glasses often will pronounce any differences and distortions and weird feelings. Good luck! Keep dem eyes healthy, we only get one pair! \~Your friendly neighborhood optometry office manager. "
10118,"when I was 11 or 12 I first went to the doctor with joint pain in my knees and feet. I was told I was over weight and my mom had my start glucosamine which helped. I had pain in my hands when writing for long times even in grade school, doctors told me I was over using my hands so to stop when it hurt now I have no hand strength since I never developed the muscles. Was diagnosed with saliva stones around 16 only because my grandfather had them as well. At 19 or 20 I had vertigo for 6 months and was told it was just allergies couldn't work, drive, anything that wasn't just sitting in the chair without moving my head. at 21 I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel in both hands at the same time when I was have my first major joint flare. At 25 was finally diagnosed with RA after telling a new doctor my feet were cold when it was 95 degrees outside that day. Told her nothing about joint pain I assumed it was normal for everyone thought everyone had that much pain everyday. She ran blood tests and I luckily had the markers that made it easy for the rheunatogist to diagnose. He did think my first appt was for my mother since I brought her with me. Then finally when I was 28 was diagnosed with sjogrens since the new doctor put together the joint pain with the dry mouth and saliva stones. Who knows if that's even everything and they're still not sure whether it's just sjogrens or both RA and sjogrens. It's an ongoing process sometimes. "
10119,My beat advice would be go to your optometrist and don't take medical advice from a uneducatedfucking 18 year old. Just my two cents. 
10120,Its nothing to worry about I have the same condition since when o was 16 now i am 19. 
10121,"I had the same issue, my left eye was compensating a lot and I never noticed until the doctor mentioned it to me and suspected I have Keratoconus. I freaked out a lot, looking back I wish I hadn't given it that much thought. It wasn't really that bad, it was just a nuisance. Iniitally the doctor will do a topography test to see if you have keratoconus, if you do have it you'll most likely have to get CXL/C3R surgery done given that your keratoconus is still progressing. You won't feel any pain during the surgery, the night after though you will feel pain. On a scale of 1-10 I would put it at 7. It hurt, but nothing I couldn't handle. Also it lasts only for a few hours. Your vision will be blurry and changing quite a bit over the coming weeks and will return to baseline around a month's time. For me it took two months. Three months after the surgery you'll be fitted for a hard lens. If you unfortunately get ghosting like me which I did not have before the surgery, that is you see ghost like double images mention it to the doctor when you're getting your lens fitted. Doesn't fully correct it, but it's really not that bad once you get use to it. Drop a comment if you have any other question and don't freak out. It's not really that bad. Hope this helped. "
10122,"I've been on various psychiatric medicines for the past 19 years. I do believe they cause dry eyes. I go through a box of retaine eye drops about every 2-3 weeks. Also, for me, they cause extreme dry mouth even though I drink a gallon of water every day. The worst offenders IMO seem to be stimulants and SSRI/SNRI antidepressants. These side effects are just something I've learned I have to deal with so that I can function like a normal person by taking psychiatric medication. "
10123,"Windows has decent font scaling but it tends to break some programs at 150% or higher. The best recommendations I can give is get a bigger monitor around the 27""-32"" size. Or alternatively get a smaller monitor (15""-22"") and only use it for the in built magnifier within win 10. The magnifier isn't bad but it takes up to much screen real estate.

10124,"I found an old one, it says -75+50x089 and then -50+50x086. The new one is both -1? I've been told I have astigmatism, but would that make my eyes change to be the same in 2 years? "
10125,Oh sorry I didn't write it. In 2015 at 15 yrs old I got my right eye done. And in November of last year was when my left cornea got almost too thin for the procedure. Right eye at this point is very bad and at around 50% vision not really usable. Left eye still in the 80% range. 
10126,"My sister and I both have strabismic amblyopia. My left eye turns in when I'm trying to read but I can often force my eyes to focus and see fine at all distances without my glasses. I was never patched and never had surgery; I vividly remember the world being blurry until I was 7 and being shocked when I wore glasses for the first time. I hid it really well from my parents! My sister had eye surgery and was patched as a young kid but her left eye went almost totally blind anyway. So I didn't actually know I had a convergence issue until last year. I asked the eye doctor and told her about how I can move my left eye independently, and she said it was convergence insufficiency. I've never been offered prism glasses but she recommended them for reading because I sometimes have a hard time forcing my left eye to cooperate. I now have two pairs of glasses: one has a progressive lens and distance prescription and the other is a prism pair with just the reading prescription. The eye doctor said she can't combine it all into one pair because the prism at distance will make me dizzy but I've been noticing more blurred vision at distance now too. I actually really like wearing glasses""<U+0080><U+009D>I have droopy eyelids and it helps conceal them, plus I'm just used to glasses (I'm now 26). Is there a way to maybe only have one pair of glasses? I'm going to see her to report on my increasing double vision at distance but just kind of curious. My sister and I aren't twins but we are 15mo apart. The eye doctor said my mom had a better chance of winning the lottery than having two kids with strabismic amblyopia in the same eye haha. "
10127,"I've worn contacts for 44 years! I used to get infections early on because you used to mix your own saline with same tablets and distilled water. OMG I shudder to think about that.

10128,Of course. Nowwadays eye pressure barely matters anyway unless it's extreme. I don't care if your IOP is 12 or 24; all I care about is if your RNFL / VF / rim is progressing. 
10129,"I asked my doctor for Sclerals but he said no because of the age of my grafts, 40 and 38 years. I get 20/30 in glasses but want to sharpen my vison. "
10130,"Everyone is different but generally at your age vision is pretty stable (that is to say it should neither improve nor worsen significantly any time soon). because I still see pretty well without them, just wearing to avoid blue light This sounds like despite your refractive error your vision is pretty comfortable. Honestly that makes sense to me. If your vision has been this way most of your life you're probably used to it. Glasses could potentially throw off depth perception in cases of high anisometropia unless you force yourself to adapt to them. Contacts could probably provide clearer vision but it might not be big enough a difference for you to deem it worth buying (I recommend just trying it out to see if you like it). LASIK would provide vision comparable or a little better than contacts, but it is much more invasive and permanent. Honestly in your shoes I would try contacts first because if you don't like contacts or don't notice and improvement in contacts then that's probably how you'll feel about LASIK too. Another point here is being nearsighted *sounds* bad but it actually protects you against losing reading vision in your 40s and 50s. The fact that you're nearsighted in just one eye means as you are now you might never need reading glasses to read when you get older (a fate that is inevitable for 99% of people). Most people in their 40s would ***kill*** to have that kind of vision. I don't really think it is wise to undo that permanently using expensive surgery, especially if you have no issues with your vision now. If you did LASIK to correct that one eye you'd see clearly at distance with both eyes until you reach early 40s, then you'd need glasses to see up close. This is *normal* and happens to everyone so it isn't exactly an unintended consequence of LASIK, but in your case abnormal is actually kind of better than normal (especially at old age) in a weird way.

10131,"My Sjogren's positive wife and I gave up any vaginal play a few years ago as it seemed no matter what we did, she'd get some kind of infection or other problem and it just wasn't worth it for her. Her sex drive is also zero. Not only due to the arthritic pain that any kind of movement causes and the infections, but she's said she sees her body as her enemy and there isn't desire for sexual pleasure. Coming at this from the spouse's side, I've looked for information on how to cope and found nothing. I have found one study that did show that spouses who are denied sex from their partner have diagnosable depression more often than spouses who are not. I was told it's ""end of life processes occurring prematurely."" But, I can't think of anything I can do besides accept it and try to emphasize all of the other reasons why I'm in love with her besides sex. I'm also not really able to talk to her about how this affects me as her inability and dislike of sex makes her feel guilty. It is pretty frustrating and really brings out a pretty bad sexual self image I developed with 20+ years of being completely single. I sometimes feel like the universe is out to get me, but I have to remind myself it's not about me. "

10137,"I (60m) was -9.0/-8.5 Had PVD then retina tear then detachment in right eye beginning in late 2018. Things ended well with successful cataract surgery in both eyes this year. (20/20 in right eye and 20/25 +2 in left eye.) Last follow-up visits were encouraging: Retina specialist said operative eye with retina history was great and he saw nothing amiss with retina in left eye, and the doctor who did the cataracts said all was good on that front. So Friday morning (about 4-months after the last cataract surgery) I noticed cloudy vision and some glare from overhead lights in left eye (the one with the good retina). No pain but some discomfort in eye. Vision seemed to deteriorate by the hour so got an urgent appointment with ophthalmologist late in day. My cataract surgeon was out of the office so I saw an associate who determined that I had iris atrophy in left eye. IOP was 35. He described the atrophy as significant and said it happened in the 3 o'clock - 6 o'clock quadrant. Said it could have been caused by contact with the IOL. Prescribed Rocklatan (netarsudil and latanoprost) and Alphagan P drops and I return Wednesday. Vision had improved between the time I made the appointment and arrived at the practice. Now is near normal. Thanks for reading this far. Seeking comments, opinions, and especially questions to take with me on my Wednesday appointment. "

There are SO many AI diseases out there, and we probably don't even know of all of them, nor are the diagnostic tests cut and dry. So yeah, you might be negative for everything on the panel, but clearly something is amiss. I hope your new doctor can acknowledge this. If not, I encourage you to continue seeking a practitioner who WILL listen to you (they do exist, promise). You've lived in your body for 18 years, so you have every right to seek answers when things don't feel right. Chin up, you're not alone in this. "
10140,"I don't know what to do. I am miserable. I wore contacts for about 6 or 7 years. I often slept in the contacts because I stayed at freinds houses and didn't take my contacts storage with me. Very naive i know. I eventually gor very irritated eyes when wearing contacts so stupid me decided lasik sounded like a good idea, i would be free of the burden of wearing glasses and having uncomfortableness from contacts. I ended up getting lasik in December of 2015. I now realise i probably had dry eye before getting lasik, and the lasik might've made it even worse. I didn't start experiencing dry eye until 10 months after the procedure. The eye doc I originally went to for lasik gave me prednisolone, it seemed to work and my dryness lasted only a month. I also took restasis but only for a few weeks. Three years went by with no issues. Unfortunately in November of 2019 about 4 years after the surgery, my dry eye returned worse than the first time. It started when I was sitting at a movie theater watching a movie, I'm guessing the dark room and huge screen had an effect on my eyes. I was also about a week into a quarter life crisis, and stopped smoking marijuana and drinking about a week before that, all of which had me extremely stressed. I sometimes wonder if stress brought this on, but I also am quick to blame it on the lasik. Since then I have been to two eye docs with not much relief or positive results. I have taken lotemax sm, alrex, systane nighttime ointment, lotemax ointment, xiidra, avenova lid wipes, tea tree lid wipes, bacitracin on my eye lids at night, preservative free prednisolone, have been doing warm compresses, all of which have not helped. I am currently weening off of the prednisone and praying it helps even in the weening off process. The next thing the eye doc has me doing currently is taking restasis which i got 6 months worth of for free from a patient assistant program but honestly i cannot afford it after that as it is ridiculously expensive. My only hope is that they keep accepting me in the program every year but i know thise companys are all about $$$. That is if it even works of course... She also has me doing warm compresses, avenova, bacitracin, and otc celluvisc 4 times a day still. All of this has already cost me more than the lasik did and then some. Honestly at this point i am extremely stressed from this and am suicidal. I dont want to live like this anymore. I have been trying to keep hope that it will get better but it has been 6 months and I have lost hope. Is it possible that if i somehow remove this emotional baggage and stress it will get better? Is there any way that it can get better without having to take an eye drop everyday or am i going to have to live the rest of my life like this? I am only 26 years old. I really want a life where im not thinking about my eyes all day. I have been considering joining the military but want my eyes fixed first, plus i don't even know if they would take me with dry eye. I want a time machine right about now. Does anyone have any clue what I can do to get out of this mess or have any input as of what couldve caused this? It seems weird to me that it happened 4 years after the surgery at a time where i was in a low point mentally. Edit: i forgot to mention i also have punctal plugs in, have used humidifiers at night, and have taken Nordic natural fish oil, and also eat salmon at least twice a week all with no results. Also the symptoms seem to be worse in the morning before i even open my eyes and at night. They are also extremely dry when my eyes are closed wheni sleep or even just ""rest"" them during the day. The eye doc doesn't think that it is MGD but thinks it's my eyes just not being able to produce enough tears. Regardless of this she still has me doing warm compresses and avenova still. She also said that my eyes dont look inflamed. Also, sometimes when I blink I can literally hear my eye lids opening up like a clicking sound. When I close my eyes I and move them left and right each one eye also makes a clicking sound when looking inward towards my nose. I also got tested for sjogrens and got my thyroid checked both through blood tests and they both came back negative. I have considered getting scleral but they are incredibly expensive from whay I've heard and apparently only last 1-3 years. The only options i have left after this restasis trial is lipiflow, serum tears which i am against doing, and sclerals. I am also considering getting a second opinion after my next eye appointment at Bascon Palmer which is apparently the best eye place in the country. "
10141,"Thanks for the comment. I feel foolish for not discussing the dry eyes more at my yearly appt.

10142,I was born with my pupil shaped like a lilypad and my parents said the doctor told them that my pupil was slightly attached to my lens but that was 20 years ago so they could be remembering wrong. The doctor used to dilate my eyes to try to get them to pull apart but it never worked and it doesn't affect my eyesight at all so we just leave it alone now. I cant for the life of me find what its called or even if there's a name for it. Anyone have any ideas?

10144,"Eyezen can help take stress off the eyes when reading, doing homework, etc. If the 10 y/o was complaining of eye strain in school or something similar to this then the glasses would most likely be helpful. Even if they weren't complaining it would still help. "

I have had this issue since many years ago probably 10 or more where when I cover my left eye which is the good one, I see a slow creeping darkness from the left corner of my right eye like a thin veil covering my vision slowly. I don't know how else to explain it. It's not that I don't see clear, my vision is clear I don't see things blurry with either eye. It's just that if I try to read letters with only my right eye it feels like this darkness which is greenish sticks to the letters and I see only the first letter and the last and some in between and try to guess the word without seeing it 100%.

10146,"Hi I am 29/F. I will start by saying, yes I have anxiety and it has flaired x 1000 in the past month. So that's always a possibility. My left eye is on and off blurry, almost like wearing 1 contact and not the other. Sometimes it feels like something is in it. Rarely the top of my eye gets a sharp pain. All of these are on and off and fluctuate. I went to my yearly opthalmologist appt yesterday (I have drusen that he checks on) and he seemed very distracted and didn't really listen to my concerns. On paper, all my tests were normal (vision, pressure, drusen hasn't changed in a year, etc) so he kind of brushed me off and said I'm fine. Assured me that my drusen wasn't affecting my eyes yet. But the blurriness is incredibly distracting on a day to day basis. Should I get a second opinion? Can I go to an optometrist for this? I've tried repHresh and systane eye drops, and as of today, I am trying compresses in the morning. I am thinking best case it could it be dry eye, pink eye, or blepharitis. "

If you want, google ""Hoya Sync 13"" and see if you can find more info on it. That's the one I use most for my pts. Anti-fatigue doesn't do anything for a bifocal, it just aims to reduce strain at whatever distance you're using them for. Great lens for pre-presbyopes, but I do use them for older pts as well. Do you mind telling me how old you are? "
10149,I have a similar issue (made a separate post today by sheer coincidence ). Can hard drusen be distinguished from familial drusen by exam? Does drusen in under 40s typically progress or stay static? 
10150,"I don't know if I have sjogrens or not, but I have an appointment coming up with a rheumatologist where I'll address it. But I've heard dry mouth is usually a significant symptom. I rarely have dry mouth. I do have dry lips that crack/peel to the point of getting crusty, even though I use chapstick daily. My nose also sometimes feels dry, and the air irritates my nose when I breathe when it happens. If I try to breathe through my mouth instead it feels very uncomfortable as the air feels like it dries out parts of my mouth and it also makes my lips feel very dry, but I assume that's probably normal? However, my eyes feel horrible. Sometimes I'll have a day where it's not bad, but they're always feeling dry. Right now it's really bad. I'm having trouble keeping my eyes open and I have to squint and blink constantly, and frequently shut my eyes for several seconds at a time, because it's so incredibly uncomfortable. If try to keep them open for more than a couple seconds in a row I start to get increased burning, the urge to shut them, and sometimes my vision will also go all foggy until I do. If I don't, by a couple seconds later they start watering and I get an unbearable burning and urge to shut them and I'd have to fight not to. Sometimes I do that on purpose just to have some wetness in my eyes from the watering and get some brief relief. Even with my constant blinking and shutting my eyes, they burn/sting all the time, feel really dry, and feel.. cold? Which I know sounds weird, but they physically feel cold. Like the same as how having uncomfortably cold hands and feet feels (which I also have pretty 24/7 in the fall and winter). Sometimes I'll notice they *are* cold to the touch (my eyelid/eye area), or if it's just one eye that feels cold it'll be colder to the touch than the other eyelid. Putting my warm palm over my eyelid makes the feeling go away, but they quickly start to feel cold again when I stop. I also notice that when I close my eyelids I get a sort of strange/cold sensation at the edge of my upper eyelids. It's the worst in the morning. It's hard to keep my eyes open at all for long when I first wake up because they feel extremely gritty and dry. It gets a little better after a bit, occasionally much better, but not always. I've tried many brands of eye drops. They don't work for any more than a couple seconds, including the more viscous gel drops. They only thing that brings any relief for some reason is heat over my eyelids, and sometimes it helps with the discomfort a bit in one or both eyes still after I remove the heat, but it doesn't that last long. I have a ton of other things going on with me, and it seems almost systemic. Almost every bodily system is affected and I haven't been doing well for a while and suspect something autoimmune. But the dry eye factor makes me wonder about sjrogens. Does this sound at all how sjrogens presents regarding dry eye symptoms? Also, if this *is* sjogrens, do the medications, like immunosuppressants help with dry eye symptoms by treating the underlying cause or would I still be just stuck with this? Things like restasis in either case are too expensive. I don't know what to do. I already feel sick all the time, and not being able to literally just.. use my eyes and keep them open comfortably is just the cherry on top. "
10151,"People have increasingly been pointing out that my eyes looks ""screwed up."" Not really a surprise since my vision has been getting worse, with more strain for the last 5 years or so. Originally I had like four paragraphs here, but I'm going to change this to list form: - When looking in the mirror, my eyes look normally aligned. The image looks pretty clear, but it feels like my eyes are straining to keep focus. - When I'm on my laptop or reading a book, I've developed this habit of ""blurring"" my vision since making myself focus is difficult and the depth looks off with up close things when I do. My left eye veers of to the left while on my laptop. Same for further away stuff, like TV, but not as severe. - I tend to do that ""blurring"" when I walk around also. Instead of my eyes shifting focus on different objects as I move around, I just have this same depth ""blur"" until I really need to focus on something. Eye veers off to the left here too. - If I cover my right eye in the mirror, then uncover it, it veers to the right. If I cover up my left eye, it veers to the left. - The vision in my left eye is worse than in my right. If I cover up my right eye, my left eye moves back into a normal position, but it's blurry. The depth of things looks... off and I feel queezy. -I find myself closing my left eye when I *really* need to focus on something, like small microwave directions on a burrito. - I had 20-20 as a teenager (late 20's now, early 20's when I started noticing an issue) and didn't notice any issue with my eyes. Nobody did, and I'm quite sure my bullies would have pointed it out. I assume it's a lazy eye issue, but why would I be able to make them look straight in the mirror, or when focusing on something consciously? Eye strain also seems to make it a lot worse.

So then I learned from a friend that I probably just have eye strain. Eventually the pressure went away. Until few days ago where I noticed that whenever I rub my eyes, I start to see little bit blurry until it goes away. I have an issue where I just cant stop rubbing my eyes.

10157,"There are more invasive surgeries but most patients can be controlled on eye drops. There's like 20 of them so there's bound to be some that work for you. The IOP going up after going down is no big deal. We look for changes over time, not 1 number. IOP varies from time of day. Part of the normal fluctuation. Ophthalmologists like to oversell the laser glaucoma surgery, even though they know the patients will likely still be on drops imo. The good news is that glaucoma is a very slow disease. As long as you take your eye drops and keep your follow up appointments, you should be good. Ask them what your Goal Iop is. If it is 20-22 then you are still mild/early stages. 15-18 more moderate stage. Low teens, more severe/advanced stage. "

10159,"I am 18[M]. I've been using my phone for a while now (last 2 months , 10+ hrs) and i suspect digital eye strain. Apart from that i started lifting few weeks back and thats when i think most symptoms popped up but i stopped using phone at the same time. So idk what started it precisely. I'm also a hypochondriac. I can't visit a doc at this moment due to covid so i wanna put myself at ease a bit. I applogize for making this a long post. I have no hereditary problems or health problems and have 20/20 vision or better. Its been like a month already and my vision has remained intact but symptoms have differed widely. So i'm going paranoid and anxious about serious diseases as i can't visit a doc now and i am scared to tell my parents too. I started noticing most of my symptoms after googling about floaters. I checked it randomly and ended up being worried about AMD , PVD , RRD and stuff. I rub my eyes occasionally but not too hard and once went paranoid about eyelashes going in my eyes and pulled my eyelids a lot one day. I hope it wouldn't have damaged my eyes. I also poked my eyes by mistake with my fingers 1-2 times. But it was 3-4 months back and had no problems. So here are the problems i have now and have had for a while : Floaters (had them since childhood, so unsure about whether they've got worse or its just that i've started noticing them more after googling symptoms) Vertical Double Vision on screens (had them for like 2-4 years and have remained static, it gets worse when i do close up work a lot without breaks and is usually less noticeable when i rest my eyes.) This one is mostly on screens like TV placed 20-25 feet away. When i look at light colored text on dark background , i see in double occassionally. Flashing Background. This is circumstantial. I've noticed that when i stare at a white or light colored wall and blink the wall appears flashing for few seconds. Noticed since few days. And it happens whenever i blink specifically looking at a light colored wall 1-2 feet in front of me. Flickering in periphery of left eye. I feel like my left corner of vision is flickering , its not the muscle but just vision. Noticed few days after lifting. It went away on its own one day but has come back and is now persistent while doing close up work and less obvious while staring at distant objects. Afterimages, i noticed some negative afterimages recently. It lasts less than a second and is more obvious at morning after waking up. More visible when i stare at something for 5-6 seconds and then move away my eyes. One day when i moved my head fast like in a 90 degree fashion to the left and back to front , i noticed a bright rectangular flash at centre of my vision, like a tubelight. It got more and more obvious when i moved my head very fast. Haven't noticed it any other time to date. One day i noticed an orange tint in my vision while moving eyes left and right. Like i was staring at a building at a distance and looking at our car and it appeared that i am seeing a brief orange tint for a second when i moved eyes from car to building immediately . Didn't notice it again. Another thing i have is a bright film like stuff moving across my vision when looking right to left. Its like a bright film or light beam is moving in the same direction as my eyes. Less noticeable in left to right direction. And mostly noticeable when staring at bright backgrounds. Only circumstantial, didnt notice any other time, only when i move eyes from right to left. Noticed 4-5 months back before other symptoms popped up. After going to bed, if i open my eyes i see my background flickering strongly when there is some light coming in, it goes away in like 5-6 seconds too. Noticed recently. While doing close up work. I can see a black spot in my extreme corners of vision. I noticed it more in my right eye. Like when i read something i feel like there is a black dot at my right periphery of eye but there's not. I've honestly never noticed stuff in my peripheral vision before so idk whether i had this for long. Recently i had a bulb flickering phenomenon in my eyes too. Like it felt like a bulb was flickering in my peripheral vision when i do close up work. Its not a flash. But just how it'd feel like if a bulb was flickering at your back while reading book. Its either got less obvious now or i think i've just started ignoring it. Any help appreciated. I'd visit a doc next year whenever i get the allowance (no appointments till january in hospitals nearby as they're all covid centres). But it seems like my life is a hell now as i'm shit scared about blinding conditions. :(. "

10161,"I've had blepharitis/MGD for over 10 years now. For most of this time I have done a routine consisting of a heated microwavable mask for 10 minutes, a massage for 30 seconds immediately after and then a lid scrub (Blephasol). My dry eyes and MGD is quite bad (ointment needed 10+ times a day) but I have managed to keep my eyes in good condition. I recently wondered if my lid scrub was causing eye irritation so I decided to swap it out for a salt soak ( recommend by some optometrists). At first I didn't notice much of a difference but by the end of the day my eyes were in agony. It made me realise how effective my routine was and how important it is to keep your eyes in good health. I've scrolled through various forums for years and it always surprised me how many people don't do a routine like this. This is a really horrible condition and I've heard of people becoming suicidal over it. If you haven't tried the routine above then you really need to, its not a cure but it can make a big difference. "

If you're paying out of pocket for sclerals it's something to look in to. "

Any surgery is a risk and you could make it worse. Believe me I thought about the same thing because I could never live in a home that has white walls for example. I normally wear sunglasses outside to see less of the floaters and to be honest with you sometimes I even forget that they are there, but do what you need to do to stay healthy and live with the floaters because any surgery is a risk.

I'm pretty sure that's what it was as all the symptoms matched, and I was thinking this could have led to corneal scarring and ultimately KC? "
10168,"Sounds good. On the off chance you do have it, don't worry about it too much. I was diagnosed about 15 years ago and the only procedure I've had done is cross linking in one eye. My vision without glasses is horrible, but I'm close to 20/20 with them on. "
10169,You got diagnosed at age 38?! That's REALLY late for KC to start kicking in... I mean i've never heard of anyone who hasnt noticed it atleast in their 20s. For me it started around 16 and noticed it at 21. I would honestly consider maybe getting a second opinion because as far as i'm aware at that age for it to start is basically impossible.

10174,"Diagnosed at 27 in 2017. Always felt fatigue and joint pain in my hands throughout my life prior but felt I was just being lazy and joint pain was probably nothing. After diagnosis, didn't think I had sjogrens as I've never had dry eyes. Mouth was dry to an extent that I just thought it was normal and it didn't bother me. Symptoms got worse around 2018-2019 and I had the dry eyes, dry mouth, muscle and joint pain everywhere. Sometimes get swollen glands in my throat during a flare. Learnt what a flare up was. That made me realise I actually had sjogrens. Only medication I was taken since 2017 was plaquenil. Currently the worst thing that affects my life rn is the fatigue and the joint and muscle pain, especially in my hands. I'm tired all the time, or in pain and low in mood. The joint pain during a flare is the bane of my existence. Started Etoricoxib a few months back which is an anti inflammatory and it helps me not be stiff in the mornings I find. The dry eyes is more of an irritant rather than affecting my life. "
10175,"I didn't either until I complained about always getting dust in my eye! The soft lenses act like lil cushions to make them more comfy, but if you go on a night out and wear them until 3am your eyes are SO DRY you basically can't see. I remember once asking my bf at 4am why it was so smokey outside and he was like ""umm... It's not??"". The bubbles are a nightmare with sclerals, but you do get into the knack of putting them in without bubbles eventually. You just gotta find what's right for you eye, I'm 30 and it's been 12 years of this and I'm still not there! At least you don't live in London so you can try it all out for free. "

An optometrist prescribed me 4 hours of daily patching at 16 (I am now 20) but it was insanely uncomfortable for me so I gave up. I am hoping to undergo it again if possible, but I wanted to know if there is even still hope for me to use eye patching to improve my binocular vision at this point. I've read that this is a misconception (as the brain still has some degree of plasticity throughout life although it decreases over time) but I wanted to see if any of you could offer me realistic expectations as far as vision improvement. I've also seen on the mayo clinic website that only ""half of children between the ages of 7 and 17 respond to treatment"" so I don't know what to think. Thank you for your advice! "
10178,"Well, people in general start to need glasses for sustained near tasks anyway at around 40. Your prescription has changed significantly and as such you're not currently indicated for a LASIK procedure (or any refractive surgery) even if some could perform it anyway. As a rule your prescription should be stable for 2 years before surgery. Currently your options are glasses, or contacts. That is eye health allowing. If you want to see if you're possibly eligible for LASIK in the future seek out consultations, they can be cheap or free. There they would check the health of your eye and thickness of cornea to determine if the procedure is possible even in the future. "
10179,"Diagnosed in 2009, I wore gas perm in right eye for a few years until my cornea got too steep. Went for years without wearing anything, dealing with the bad vision until I got the surgery in 2014 (I was 28 years old). Recovery was tough for me. I spent hours in my basement every morning not able to open my right eye. The light was too overbearing for it. I remember wearing a patch and sun glasses and it still hurt. Recovery took some time, and vision didn't get better until a few years after surgery. I tried the scleral lenses and never could get the comfort. I have 20/60 vision in my right eye now, and before was legally beyond blind. I am so glad I got the surgery. Unfortunately my donor remained anonymous. Ive wrote a few letters and never heard back. I'd love so much to understand who it was, but I can understand the family being private about it. I'm so thankful for that person. "

They allowed me to wear a regular soft toric lens for several years instead of any RGP or Sclerals which was nice. But your mileage may vary with them as i've heard other people with not as beneficial results. Last year though, something changed and I could no longer wear the toric lens and tried hybrids and sclerals to no avail. I wore a Hyrdokone for awhile which helped mitigate ghosting but the vision was not great and comfort was up and down. I had them removed the day of my left corneal transplant (January 29) as they were right in the way of the laser. They def were a help to me and even gave me vision during my right cornea transplant so i could work and watch TV. As i said, they were def a huge win for me for nearly 15 years and am glad I got them done. "

10187,"Hi there, I'm a 20 year old male who has recently started experiencing a few vision symptoms, and I am wondering if you guys think I should bring up worries on possible keratoconus? I went to an optometrist for all of this, though he mostly just prescribed me normal lenses with a prism now, and didn't actually read the symptoms the nurse wrote down (Which is my bad, i should have brought it all up again, due to the fact doctor's don't usually read the notes.) But also I've heard the test for Keratoconus is a corneal topography, which, looking at those machines, I haven't seen anything like it nor did they use it on me, just the normal machines for getting prescriptions like I have gotten all the time. Basically I know he didnt read the notes because he was about to send me home with normal prescription lenses until I mentioned double vision, after which he decided to test with prisms and stuff, so I don't think he got the full information. My prescription also jumped from -8 to -11 despite previously having no change for a year, and it's definitely been getting worse with vision over the last year or two. But I have an appointment again on Monday for me to actually bring up all the symptoms, and I'm wondering if it would be a good idea bringing the possibility of Keratoconus to the table? Basically, it started around a week or so ago when I woke up and felt like the vision, especially in my right eye was weird. My left eye seemed somewhat fine, but something felt really off about my right eye suddenly. I had been rubbing my eye a lot lately before then, and it was only really then that I realized it also felt like there was something stuck in my eye, though it's intermittent, which has continued despite rushing to the ER and them telling me theres nothing in my eye, and my eye has no scratches. The reason I went to the ER is that a couple nights later I noticed a bit of double vision in my right eye, which I had never noticed before, so I got that checked out, and they said it was nothing they could see there, and to go to an opthamologist. There's also been the intermittent feeling of something stuck in my eye, but the double vision has gotten a bit worse over the past week, it's basically, first it was only on white text on black backgrounds, seeing that text stacked on top of itself but it was like a ghost. Now it seems to be rising higher, and happens with stuff like my finger, and on colored text and objects and black text on white backgrounds too, so it seems to be getting worse. I've also been getting a bit of eye pain, but mostly resulting in headaches, which I think is due to the eye strain, probably. I also get streaks down from light, and it seems to make it real hard to see past when the light is streaking down my vision, such as walking at night and being near a street lamp, there's streaks of the light down my vision. It gets a bit better if I open my eyes super wide though. Not to mention large halos around bright objects like traffic lights at night. It's also seemed like I can see less at night than I used to, and doing something like looking through my phone camera makes a huge difference compared to what I'm able to actually see. Closing my eyes a bit also makes my double vision worse, having my eyes completely open makes it less bad than squinting, but there seems to be a sweet spot. It's definitely worse in my right eye, though my left eye seems to be getting worse too. At first it seemed like the double vision in my left eye went away with blinking, but it now seems constant, though not at the same level as my right eye. It also goes away in my right eye (the double vision) mostly, If i'm looking through the top of my eye, seemingly, and not out the front directly. It also seems to be mostly in the center/left of my vision, and not out of the right side of my eye (i.e. the ghost sort of cuts off halfway through a paragraph when looking straight at it.) Basically, I'm wondering if it's a good idea to bring the concerns of keratoconus up to the optometrist on monday, or if thats just a stupid idea, and I'm overthinking? I was also told that I need Vision Therapy for my esotropia, as well as given prism lenses with BO of 5, set to arrive in 3 weeks. "

So here goes my word vomit as an attempt to figure out what the hell this thing is!! \-feeling like eye is out of focus and that it is coming from the outside? \-It's different than regular poor vision (bit of a blurry vision in my right eye also but that isnt accompanied by the feeling the left one has) \-makes me feel like i have a mental fog that is caused by my left eye as weird as that sounds \-It just feels harder to focus because of this left eye... focus in general.. my vision feels off but even just my mental focus feels off \-a feeling of having some glossy substance in the corner of my eye? (Eyes do not look glossy.. just feel?) \-i wouldnt say it hurts but it's really annoying to have this feeling \-kind of similar to an ocular migraine but this is close to 24/7 and i do not seem to have genuinely lost any spot of my vision when i do a finger test on the side of my eye. It just feels off. Does any of this make sense? Thanks \--also Im a 25 year female.

10194,"Hey all - been dealing with eye flashes since the middle of August. I am 36/F. They happen mostly at night, in the dark, often when I'm tired. Sometimes I feel like they may be connected to blood pressure or breathing or something, but I don't know for sure. They happen more often if I'm smiling or squinting or have some sort of tension in my face near my eye. The flashes are mostly little lines that travel in a small arc shape, lower left hand corner of my peripheral vision. I mostly see them when my eyes are open, but I can see dim ghostly versions of them when my eyes are closed. If I see them during the day, they are just a bright horizontal line in the left side of my peripheral vision, more like a camera flash but only in one small sliver of my eye. I've seen an ophthalmologist, he told me it was due to my myopia, and that my retina hasn't detached but is pulling. He also asked if I had any trauma to my eye, and the only thing I could think of is when I took too much MDMA in the summer, which makes my eyes shake uncontrollably. He did a quick laser procedure that was supposed to prevent it from detaching or tearing. He told me it might not stop the flashes, but at least my eye is safer. It certainly hasn't stopped the flashes, I see them in the same frequency. My question is: am I going to see these flashes for the rest of my life, or until one day my retina inevitably detaches? Do I need to learn how to be friends with them? I'm still a little concerned every time I see them""<U+00A6>. it's hard not to be anxious that this might be the time it's a detachment. Also, is there any validity to my theory that it might have been the eye shaking that could have caused trauma to my eye? I feel like I'm too young for this to be happening otherwise.

10196,"It depends on the kid. If I have a cooperative child who I'm measuring at 20 pd distance and 50 pd near, they're probably getting bifocals right off the bat (especially if they're a relatively low hyperope).

We can debate the semantics of ""common"" and the most appropriate management of a case for which we only have some of the details, but ultimately, the spectacles are going to be beneficial to the patient. If the bifocal turns out to be unnecessary, then great! That can be removed at follow up, or next year. "
10197,"Hello. Sorry for being so panicked, I'm not looking for a diagnosis as I have been to alot of doctors. For a year or so i developed floaters, I have lots of them in both eyes. I also had ocassional flashes, which appear more and more now. I basically cant even go outside without these fucking floaters. These are not my biggest complaint though, because since September I developed some scotomas Ã®n both eyes, near my central vision. They are quite bothersome and Idk if they got bigger. Some retina specialist I went to told me everything is fine. Both eyes have a CD ratio of 0.1-0.2 etc. Prior to all these symptoms, I used to take two benzos per night for a few months so I can sleep. (Xanax+Cinolazepam, the latter being a benzo exclusive to EU). I took them until mid September if I recall. IOP is always 19-20-21 when taken with a puff tonometry. So I'd imagine my real values could be around 17/18 IF they used goldmann. Could the psychiatric medication I took for a while, cause the symptoms I have now? I take xanax from time to time but not like i used to. My doctor told me to stop taking them all together because they can impact eyes. So for a TLDR: flashes and floaters since last year Floaters growing more and more during the last past months Flashes also appearing more for about two weeks now. Since September I developed some scotomas. I'd love an opinion on this. I have been to 5 or 6 doctors now, none of them found anything and besides my shrink who advised me to stop taking benzos, nobody said anything. "

10199,"You're welcome!! As far as I have been told, TPRK removes the ablations of the cornea and will make it more regular and flat. That will help in reducing the visual acuity (not exactly sure what it means but according to my understanding, for example - if pre op you're at 6/24, then post op it might improve to 6/12 or 6/9) It might reduce the prescription strength too, but not sure how it works. This is from my understanding and not sure if it is correct. It would be better to ask your doc. "

10203,"Like curedofKC, I was diagnosed in the early 70s, so CXL came way too late to help me. Fortunately it never progressed to the point of needing transplants for me. Based on what I've read, a second round of CXL is just as likely to stop the progression of KC as it is for those who have not done CXL. In other words, the failure of CXL on a first attempt does NOT mean it is any more likely to fail on a second attempt. However, you are likely getting toward the age when KC stops progressing on its own. If you are in your 30s you probably should do CXL again only if there is evidence of active progression in your most recent corneal topography. "

My favorite preservative free artificial tears are Retaine MGD, Refresh Digital and Soothe XP. Prescription dry eye therapy is also available (Restasis, Xiidra, Cequa, etc). It may also be helpful to get a second opinion from another eye doctor who will listen to your concerns and try to address them. "

10216,"Hello everyone, So I could really get your opinion on what exactly is my problem, because it's really hard for me to find some answers, even with professionals when I bring it up during eye exams, maybe I just explain myself poorly. So I'm currently 24 years old, with hyperopia and astigmatism. My eye correction is +4.25 (0 -0.75) and +4.50 (170 -1.25) This correction has been given to me through a cycloplegic test. I wear my glasses all the time. I've had an eye surgery for a strabismus on my right eye when I was 7 or something. So here's the thing, even when I wear my glasses, I cannot see clearly with my near vision, it is just blurry if I loose my eyes muscles. So I have to force myself to see clearly, all the time. It's been like that for years, I don't even know when it started to be honest, it felt like it was always like that. It's really hard to work like that, having a computer screen in front of me most of the time. Well, I can manage, but it might be the reason why I feel tired quite often when I get home, and need to rest my eyes. I've always tried to bring it up with professionals, but they always said that it was normal, but honestly doesn't make sense to me. Why would it be normal, given that I wear glasses that are supposed to correct my vision? Here's how I see exactly: \- Without glasses: everything is blurry. I can force my eyes and see clearly, with quite a moderate effort, my right eye is obviously back to its former position. \- With glasses: \- long distance: clear vision, no problem. Although sometimes it feels like an eye is more efficient than the other. \- near distance: blurry vision, need to use a light effort to see clearly. My right eye doesn't seem to move. I get diplopia when I look at small objects that are quite close. If I stare at someone within 5 centimeters, it might happen too with their head. I need a moderate effort to get rid of it and see clearly. So that's pretty much my question, what is it that I have exactly, is it some sort of presbyopia? It would sound really odd given that it's happened to me for years. But why not eh. And what can I do, except bearing with it? Progressive lenses? LASIK or something similar? Wouldn't it just correct my vision just like my glasses? So I would basically need reading glasses after anyway? But at least, ""half"" of the problem would be solved let's say. Thank you very much if you can help me with it! "
10217,"I'm 46 and just got my first pair of glasses after having a recent eye exam because of having fairly regular mild headaches in the area around/behind the eyes and temples. In the eye exam, they determined I have an astigmatism and gave me a prescription that ended up not working for me. It was so powerful, it made everything move as I moved my head around. I couldn't wear them for more than 5 minutes without getting nauseous and dizzy. I've been back now 2 other times and each time the doc has dialed back the astigmatism correction in the prescription. Its now -.25. It's better than before but I still can't wear them for very long without getting disoriented or getting a headache. While wearing them, objects still move or are distorted in the periphery of my vision as I turn to look around. This is so damn frustrating and I think I'm still getting headaches in my eye area because I need the correction but haven't been able to get the glasses to work. I'm going back in for the 4th time in a few days... is it possible that the machines misread that I have astigmatism? I just don't get what's going on. Thanks for any help. "
10218,"Yes my eyes burn 24/7 and my tear production is normal, if not excessive. It's been like this going on 10 years now. Can't wear contacts anymore also, otc eye drops do nothing for me. Finally when Xiidra came out I got relief, otherwise it was disabling. There are a lot of treatments out there for dry eye, go see a doctor (ideally one who specializes in dry eye) and start trying treatments until you find one that works (and to rule out other conditions, problems with eyes can indicate wider systemic conditions, but not always). You can have normal tear volume production, and those tears don't contain the right molecules that protect and soothe the eye. Cheapest solution to try (according to my dr) is plugs, but I'm skeptical they would help with my condition since I produce excessive tears. Anyways, I just wanted you to know you're not alone, good luck and hang in there. "
10219,"There's no hard stop for eye growth or glasses prescription change for some people with high myopia. Most people's rx has stopped changing in late teens to twenties though. If they have 6D of astigmatism, that's another issue and they should be worried about corneal ectasia like keratoconus. That can certainly progress through the 20s and maybe 30s. Contact lens shape won't cause more or less refractive change the way you talk about it. Studying and screen time are not likely affecting this persons refraction. There is evidence that near work in kids can contribute to progressive myopia and outdoor time can help reduce the risk. Text size doesn't affect refraction either. "
10220,"First of all, hang in there! There is a solution out there! Particularly if your dry eyes are this extreme! You are doing great persevering and keep up the good job! Take it day by day and be diligent with your routine/treatment! Don't give up, you can do it! Have you tried omega 3 tablets? Theratears nutrition or lacritec 60s. They are essential to fighting dry eyes and affordable. Seems like at this stage, you would have quite a bit of inflammation in the eyes. Maybe icepack at night to help? Having read the other comments, could your thyroid issue be the cause of dry eyes? I hear autoimmune diseases can be a cause, in addition to hormonal imbalances (particularly women going to menopause). May be worth revisiting medication/blood results etc. Keep us updated and happy to provide a fresh perspective to the extent helpful! "
10221,"Saying you're ""blind,"" whether your glasses prescription is -0.50 or -8.00, but having good vision with your glasses, is insulting to people who actually are blind. Hell, even 20/100+ with glasses isn't blind; you can legally drive in California with that visual acuity, even if your other eye is no light perception. If you're worse than 20/200 with glasses in both eyes, then you can say you're blind. Or if you have severely restricted visual fields. I might give you a pass if you're good in one eye but 20/200 or worse in the other, but you better always qualify it with ""in one eye."" One eye with good vision is a hell of a lot better than both eyes with no light perception. But everyone else, stop it. Oh, and docs, don't forget about RGPs/sclerals. I've seen too many 40+ year old patients who were 20/200 with glasses their entire lives, but 20/30-ish when I popped on a scleral, and yet no previous doc had apparently even tried an RGP at any time. It's heartbreaking to see a 50-year-old man break down in tears because he was unable to see even remotely clearly for so much of his life when he could have. Hell, even if they have a fairly obvious amblyogenic factor, at least slap one on to see if it helps. At worst, you wasted a minute. Also, I've seen too many patients who still saw poorly in a trial corneal RGP but beautifully in a trial scleral to ever again trust corneal RGPs to give me a potential optimal BCVA. Or cataracts. I've seen at least a few ""monocular due to traumatic cataract"" patients who went around with essentially one eye for 10+ years, got cataract surgery, and were 20/20 in both eyes afterwards. Obviously if they have a massive RD back there or something, yeah, it's pointless, but what a loss for the others whose retinas were fine. Oh, and one more back on the patients. Especially if you're over 40 or so, don't not have an eye exam for 10+ years. End-stage glaucoma and severe macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy and such often creep up slowly, so don't screw yourself by being the unlucky person who doesn't get an eye exam until it's too late. Or, not eye related, but like my grandpa, who smoked like a chimney and never saw a doctor, until finally when he went in, and the doc was like, ""He's more cancer now than man."" Finally, if you see flashes / floaters / a black curtain (especially after getting hit in the eye), or your eye gets red / blurry / painful, get in to see your eye doctor ASAP. Yeah, I'm sick of seeing minimal iritis for the 50th time that doesn't even need pred after a patient got punched, or a patient freaking out about a tiny subconj heme, but I'd much rather be bored than see you 6 months later when you have a massive retinal detachment that could have been fixed 6 months ago but not now. OK, this is starting to wander a bit. In short, if you're not blind, stop saying you are, get regular eye exams so you don't go blind (and regular health exams so you don't go so many other horrible things), and if you think something might be wrong, see an eye doctor right away. And don't let your doc tell you you're basically blind if there's a way to fix it (although how you're supposed to know that, I dunno; second and third opinion, I guess). PS: if you're worried about solar retinopathy, go see a doc with an OCT and have them scan your macula. And docs, if you're checking for solar retinopathy with an OCT, make sure to do both a wide and a fine scan. I've missed some on wide I've picked up on fine and vice versa, so don't just do one. "
10222,"Well the good thing is they caught it early. For me for example i was 21 when I found out I had it and was nearing legally blind in my bad eye at that point. So although it may suck finding out, there's good in it aswell. "
10223,"Yep, they went away completely. My problem was pretty bad (6/20) in both eyes without glasses. LASIK was not an option as it weakens the cornea and one of the symptoms of KC is a weakened cornea. So there is very high risk things will get worse with LASIK, don't ever go to a doctor who recommends LASIK after being diagnosed with KC. Edit: one of the biggest issues with ICLs is that you have to be very religious in not rubbing your eyes. Doing so can change the position of the lenses affecting vision. I had a 10% deviation in my lenses after 6 years because I used to rub my eyes because of allergies. Still no big deal, but I have stopped rubbing eyes despite how much it itches. "

10226,"Hi! For the past 6 months I've been taking tests to see if I really do have Soeren's Syndrome. It started with a simple blood test and a spinal fluid test. My Doctor found that I had SSA antibodies, specifically Ro60. Then it went on with an eye test, where they thorougly checked my eyes (moist level, back of the eye, cornea, eye pressure etc) and found nothing wrong. Everything was normal (the moist level was a bit over average, so no problem with dryness). Then things proceeded with with a salivary flow test and a mouth check (thoroughly inspect my gums and tongue). Nothing unusual there either. According to the doctor, my saliva flow was much higher that average. I've been reading alot about the symptoms of Sjogren's but I can't relate to any of it, neither joint/muscle pain or tiredness Now I've been wondering If I really do have it, since people keep saying that having a SSA/SSB antibody means that you 100% have a type of autoimmune disease/Soeren's. But I read somewhere that a small percentage of perfectly healthy individuals can have these antibodies. Is this true? Either way, my tests all show negative for soerens syndrome except for the SSA antibody. So I'm wondering wether I should proceed with the lip biopsy or not.

10227,"Hi everyone. Just wanted to ask the Redditors out there about my vision in my right eye which I have always been told is amblyopic since my first eye test as a teenager. It was quite a surprise to be honest although the initial consultation I've had was a bit rushed and so every subsequent eye test I've gone into and caveated the eye is lazy when starting the test. I achieve around 6/9-6/12 with the eye. Both eyes I achieve 6/4. Every optician I've seen since then always asks if I had patching as a child, but I remember having great vision when I was younger in both eyes (I used to swim a lot) and no patching or anything like that. One optician did think it was odd that when adding a pinhole? in front of the eye it did greatly help my vision and referred me to an ophthalmologist who did an OCT scan after they found some mark on my retina, but everything was healthy and nothing to worry about. My question is, is it definitely amblyopia or could it be something else that I should speak to an optometrist or ophthalmologist about? I sort of try to explain that I can see the letters either side of where I'm looking but not directly in the centre, it's like a black fuzzy band when I close my good eye. My current Rx is -2.25 cyl-1.00 axis 175 in good eye and -3.25 in bad eye. "

10239,"I would need to evaluate your corneal topography scans and get an OCT of your scleral lens while on the cornea to truly answer this question. However, when KCN gets very advanced the cone can become very steep with K values in the high 60's or even 70's. It then becomes difficult to fit a scleral lens above the cornea. You can get ""touch"" where there is no clearance above the cornea. This can lead to discomfort and visual changes. "
10240,"I just got an eye test and it turns out my PD measurement is 75 (way above the average), my optician was surprised lol. How common is it to have a pupillary distance of 75mm and does this imply a better peripheral vision or do i just have wide set eyes? "
10241,"Hi guys, recently I had a checkup and was given a prescription for glasses due to an astigmatism in one eye. I am a generally healthy 21 Y/O male. My optometrist noticed that I had high eye pressure indicative of glaucoma, and ""pale optic nerves. I was referred to get a second opinion, in which both agreed that it was likely to be just the way my eyes naturally are. However, I have been referred to get an MRI scan for 'neuro-imaging' and am feeling incredibly anxious due to the implication, along side google searches indicating that it could be a brain tumour. For reference, the second opinion optometrist found that I have ""bilateral pale optic nerve fibre layer thinning but normal function and ""thin ganglion cell layer, but normal outer retinal function. Sorry if this is a ramble, but I'm very anxious and hoping someone can shed some light as to whether it's possible that this is just how my eyes naturally are. "
10242,"I completely understand. Of course listen to your body and get checked as necessary. I have many, many autoimmune or related conditions, so I'm hyper aware of any changes, waiting for what's coming next. However, I try to balance that by thinking of my husband's grandfather, who lived in fear his whole life that he would get cancer. He eventually did get cancer in his 70's, but he spent 50 miserable years dreading that moment. Don't do that. So, night sweats could be a lot of things. There probably aren't any more tests a doctor would order at this point, so put this in the ""noted""<U+009D> column and leave it there. The most likely cause is something normal (for you). If it gets worse or if you have other symptoms, get checked. But avoid that over-thinking rabbit hole or you will always be looking around the corner for something instead of seeing the life that's ahead of you. "
10243,As far as I know after 10-15 of LASIK surgery some amount Myopia or astigmatism or both may return back and they have to use specs or contacts again. Does same thing happens after ICL surgery also?

(alk phos 140, ALT 68, AST 64) They weren't super high and have since come down a bit, but given my Reynaud's and + ANA w high titre, GI doc thought I should get a biopsy to check for liver auto immune. Says its much better to treat early. Hoping they're just being overly cautious. It sounds like you're younger than me (I'm 57) ... I *think* my Reynaud's started in my 40's. "
10245,"I have my yearly exam this week and have struggled the past couple years with vision that I feel is not sharp enough. I mainly notice it driving with road signs and the time on the microwave/stove (which was the first thing I remember not being able to see before I got glasses). It doesn't matter if I'm wearing glasses or contacts. I've mentioned previously I thought my vision had gotten worse but just ended up being switched to dailies and a different base curve. My prescription has decreased since college, was -2.25 with some slight astigmatism, this was a different doctor and practice, but has held steady at -1.5 for the past 5 or so years. The only difference besides the doctor is when my prescription is checked- first doctor did it before dilating drops this one does it after. I would just pay for the photo instead to see if that makes a difference but I'm still underemployed due to covid impacts on my industry and the extra money just isn't there. So my question is how to emphasize that I'm not happy with my vision? Should I mention the previous higher prescriptions or the dilating? The doctor usually only comes in after the drops so do I mention this to the tech? I just want to get to a sharper prescription where I'm happy with my vision. Edited to add: during covid I was cleaning out some stuff and car across my first glasses and put them on over contacts and while still not perfect it is clearer. I did the lingo eyewear app where it tells you the prescription of your glasses and it said they were R -.5 SPH L -.5 SPH -.5 CYL 94 AXIS. "
10246,"I'm 20, female. No family history of any eye disease. I've been myopic since 12yo, gradually increase throughout the year and then stopped progressing at -3.25DS since 2019. My general health is good and apart from PCOS i don't have anything else. I dont take any medications. 6 months ago, I noticed seeing these flashing lights when i was about to go to bed, in the dark, they were more like light flickering very fast, like when the TV signal is off kinda thing but only at the bottom of my field of view. I feel like it was more sudden than gradual but i can't pinpoint. When i look back now it seems sudden. It would happen on the odd night but eventually I think i just learnt to accept it and thought of it as normal. Now when I wake up in the morning and go somewhere Bright, i see my vision sort of vibrating in the centre? I'm an optometry student so i always have people do volk on me and they've never seen any retinal detachment or anything dangerous. I apparently have some peripheral retinal degeneration (i think lattice?) but got told its nothing to worry about atm. I do see some floaters. very round and they look like....a cross section of a blood vessel. When i try to look at them, they move away so I can never look at them directly - I've always had those. The ones that are new are these long stringy transparent ones which I only see in Bright lighting and i can look directly at them and follow them. They've been stable now though but i never used to have them. My vision is 6/5, perfectly fine. Something I've always had is when I look at words the one I'm looking doesn't move much but the rest of the words look like they are coming off the page (like they are in 3D) or I see a ripple affect in the periphery but as soon as i look there it goes away. Despite being an optom student i have never heard of this. I know i probably have many unrelated vision problems here, especially the last one since I've always had it but if someome could perhaps explain to why I see flickering lights? And also why do i see words coming off the page sometimes? "

10249,"I can't help with a recommendation for an optometrist. But I would suggest you also locate an ophthalmologist, preferably a corneal specialist and more preferably a specialist in corneal ectasias. Since you have been lax about getting annual eye exams to track the progress of your KC, it would be good to establish where you are now. If you have, or can get, copies of your records from previous eye exams, particularly any topographies or pachymetries that were done, that will be of interest to the doctor who sees you. If my math is right you are now about 30 and your KC started about 13 years ago. There is a chance that your corneas have stabilized and your KC is no longer progressing. Whether or not you are likely to progress further is a significant question that you should try to find an answer for. "

10254,"Dear optometry subreddit, my eye prescription is: R: 0.25, 1.5, 5 L: 0.75, 2.25, 165 I know it's not that big of a difference, but still, my right eye got extremely dominant over the past year or two. I find myself closing my left eye and just looking through the right eye almost every time I'm behind my phone or computer screen, which I do a lot. In the past week, I got fitted with new glasses and my prescription stayed the same, so my eyesight didn't get worse I just developed a dominant eye. Now I know it can't be good for me always looking at monitors through one eye and besides It probably looks really weird when I'm in public squinting so hard while looking at my phone. I've tried keeping close attention to it and when I catch myself closing my left eye I open it (there really isn't much of a difference looking through both eyes or just the right one... if I look just through the right eye the picture is just a little bit sharper). But looking through my right eye got deep into my subconscious and I'm barely catching myself doing it. Any advice on what to do to rid of this habit? Any exercises or something. I've heard of one exercise but I don't know if that would work. It involves getting those old blue/red 3D glasses and cutting out the red foil and taping It over my right lense then settings the screening to a reddish color. That would then block some of the vision to my right eye forcing me to switch to my left eye as the dominant one. It sounds really uncomfortable and it would require turning my screen red and removing some of its colors which would hider my job quite a lot. Any others suggestions? "
10255,"Hello Everyone, I was just wondering if anyone was familiar with the issue I have been having for a very long time but has recently gotten worse; So ONLY my left eye gets really really red (Randomly) on a monthly basis and it is usually but not always accompanied with a swollen cervical lymph node on the right side of my neck/jaw, both last 2-4 days. Also, I don't always get sick when my eye gets red but when I do get sick my left eye is always very very red beforehand. I remember talking to an optometrist a long time ago and they mentioned that this exact situation could be an early signal of a fairly severe autoimmune disease. IT IS Not Pink Eye OR BACTERIAL, there is no itch nor does it ever spread to my right eye ever. (I am a 25 YO Male and this has been happening for many years, but recently has been getting more common and when I say red, I mean the whites of my eyes become extremely bloodshot). "

I was talking about the riboflavin delivery devise. I don't understand what you mean by ""short-cut doing both eyes"". They did just use the one light for both eyes. I'm sorry, but I don't have any paperwork. I can tell you that we have two major(?) eye clinics in the area: MN Eye consultants and St Paul Eye Clinic (They each have under ten locations but they're the ones in the area) and St Paul sent me to MN to have the procedure done. If they 'made it up', that is possible, but it was signed off on by a different company. "
10259,I think both are toric because I can see both lenses have that little dash at the 6 and 12 o'clock.

Although same as just cxl alone, only 94.4 percent showed stability. So there is risk that when you get it, you would still have KK but thinner cornea. But it is not new procedure. well over 15 of history. I am also thinking about this procedure. But in my country are is no such professionals. So i am looking abroad. Looking at: PLEC in Canada and LaserVision in Athens Greece. PLEC said that by my maps they would charge me 2800 USD per eye. And in Greece they said they need to see me first to give me price and other info. By the way PLEC can consult you remotely if you have your eye maps if such procedure could be done to you, and maybe they would give you approximate price.

10268,"Male 34 years old Over the past few months, I've had a few instances of my vision flickering black. Like when the lights in the house flicker real quickly. No long term vision loss, just a very very quick flicker. It happened again yesterday and about 20 mins later I did get a tension/pressure headache that radiated around my temple area (These types of headaches are common for me though). I have seen an eye doctor and they took an image of both of my eyes and also looked at them and said they said everything looks normal. Also had a brain ct scan as I went to the ER because I was having a really bad headache and also noticed the whole eye flicker thing and was afraid I was having a stroke or TIA or something. Everything came back normal from that as well. Just wondering if there's anything else I should be looking into or maybe these are just weird ocular migraines I'm getting or something (Although with those I've never read a black flicker was part of them, just mostly the Aruas that you would see).

10269,"I recently had a physical and had some blood tests done. My doctor called me a few days later saying that one of the markers (something like that) showed positive for Sjogren's and wanted to refer me to a rheumatologist. Honestly, this diagnosis came out of the blue for me. I have slightly dry eyes and skin, but I live in Colorado and wear contacts, also I'm not great about applying lotion so none of the dryness seemed unusual or severe to me. I also don't feel like I have dry mouth. I do have occasional brain fog and fatigue but again it's not something I would consider unusual. I wasn't too concerned when she said it just caused dry eyes and dry mouth, but after doing some research I'm terrified of it developing into something a lot worse. Here's where I'm questioning the accuracy of the diagnosis, I've read about how it has taken people a long time to get diagnosed even though they had all the symptoms, and how it can be a long process to get diagnosed. If all that is true, how did I get diagnosed so easily with just a simple blood test, with no prior complaints about symptoms? I've made an appointment with a rheumatologist so I'm sure I'll get some definite answers then but I would greatly appreciate some advice/experience/info here as well.

My 12 year old also has a -5.00 for her left eye and a -2.50 for her right now. So I get the frustration. It's aggravating as hell. Especially when it comes to having to wait. Doctors can only take so many patients at a time. Especially right now during a pandemic. I live in Maryland and it's not easy getting my child in. So instead of hitting the panic button try closing your eyes and relaxing a bit. This isn't the end for you. With this disease you are going to need a lot of patients. (I have to remind myself of this when things are bad). If you need to talk to your specialist then make that call. See if they can get you in. Panicking won't help. My 12 year old needs a cornea transplant in her left eye and I have to wait until she is older before she can have that surgery. If you have not been seen by a Keratoconus specialist yet, that needs to be the first step. Understand it can take 3 months before getting an appointment. And sometimes it can take up to 6 months. So do some breathing exercises and try not to work yourself up. Again, easier said than done. But waiting is key. "

I did vision therapy for 3 months which sometimes helped, but I noticed now months after the issue is back, I seem to had trouble to converge my eyes from up close. My left used to drift away after a certain distance, now I can bring them together but one goes in further inwards than the other one, and still up close my vision is blurred, close up I mean at least 20 cm from my face - is this normal? It feels like from up close my vision is taking two different images shifted from esch other, is not two objects separated by a space, its literally my an uncomfortable 3D version of the object. It doesnmt look like one solid object it seems like two not very solid images of the object I look at, it's hard to distinguish the edge of objects so close. It seems better if i close one eye. I have been told multiple times that I am fine, i suffer from dry eye, and the only one that gave me answers was the neuro ophtalmologists he thinks this is why my vision is weird, but eventhough i finished vision therapy I still don't see well? Any clue on what might be the weird not solid image from up close? It is kind of ghosting I would describe it but from up close Also , is my vision supposed to be clear from 20 cm away? 20 cm from my face is the ghosting, and less thhan 20 cm is just blurry?? I keep thinking this might be a tumour in my brain but I hace seen every specialist and no explanation, there is a huge language barrier but they aleays tell me it all looks fine? even with glasses vision improved but not fully, should I get more opinions and from which specialist?

The Dr is probably basing their decision on the general demographic where most people show signs of KC in there teens, have a bigger digression either side of 20 then late 20s or so KC is somewhat steady. Being your age Dr probably thinks your KC is somewhat steady. To me you don't seem to fit the demographic. Diagnosed 6 years ago and can still wear glasses to a degree. If the topography of your KC is steady over the 6 years and vision loss is age then you don't need to worry. If your KC is changing your vision definitely pursue this further. "

Also the lights at night have severe ghosting (as I mentioned above) and have weird rainbow like patterns (kind of starburts but spreading all the wayy around in the glare of the lights) and as well as Light streaks when I blink or squint. And my eyeglasses prescription is Sph -1.75 Cyl -0.50 X 160 in Left eye and in the right it is Sph -1.00 Cyl -1.00 X 180, I am constantly wearing eyeglasses (the doctor which I consulted said not to wear contact lenses as I have some form of severe dry eyes) but sadly it just makes the ghosting and other things and my vision clearer that's it. It dosen't help in any of my symptoms. Changed my eyeglasses prescription thrice and it too sadly didn't help.

Aside from the obvious precautions, could I be doing anything more to protect, or even improve my vision? I've been told that corrective surgery isn't really an option, or won't do any better than glasses or my contact, which is pretty minimal. Do you think it will be in my future? I'm almost 44. Can I expect it to age equally with my other eye, or might it be faster? Should I be preparing now for early loss of sight, either accidentally or naturally? Why don't I have better night vision? My coloboma is very photosensitive, and I wear sunglasses more often than not when outside. This leads me to feel entitled to super night vision lol. In my research online, it seems as though the iris is usually blue or amber. Is that possible? Is heterochromia more commonly seen with coloboma? I was told mine is unrelated.

I am utterly frustrated because I just can't seem to catch a break with this shit. Been to a gazillion appointments and everything is always Normal. But, my body is saying it's not normal. In 2018, I had a flare with lasting symptoms: Palmer Erythema Dry ears - I no longer produce ear wax My oily skin turned into dry peeling skin My uterus was removed due to suspected adenomyosis. Kept an ovary. I no longer need deodorant. Occasionally, I will get BO and have to use deodorant but I haven't bought a new stick since 2018 and that one is still the one I use. Dry eye game stepped up - I started needing to use drops two times a day Lower back pain and I was diagnosed with IC In 2021 another flare happened:l in April and it's getting worse rapidly: Vaginal dryness which I'm super sad about but very occasionally I will lubricate naturally Dry ears have become itchy, so now I need drops in them Dry eyes have gotten worse - now I need to use drops 6-10 times a day. Occasionally, the dry eye is so bad that the vision in my right eye is blurry. Dry dry mouth with parotid gland involvement - which has been the most concerning. It is bilateral but the left side is significantly larger. They fluctuate but never go completely down. I use biotene products, candies and gum. I constantly clear my throat. Had a ct scan done in April and everything came back normal. Went to a rheumatologist - who said it sounds like sjogrens but blood test results were normal. Went back to ENT who referred me to a specialist in salivary gland disorders who will be doing a lip biopsy. My lips are dry I use chapstick multiple times a day My tongue burns and I get geographic tongue regularly I drink so much water like 6 to 8 16.9 fl oz bottles daily. Sinus issues""<U+00A6>. I'm talking about pressure, like an elephant is sitting in my face. Dry nose which I now have to use gel to combat on a regular basis. Dry hair which has been falling out a lot more Had to see a pulmonologist because breathing at times has become a chore. Diagnosed with activity induced asthma and LPR. Life pretty much sucks right now and I just want to cry because my frustration levels are out the roof. Background: I was diagnosed borderline hashi back in 2018 due to antibodies. However, they were low and my tsh which was 1.4 and Free t4 which was 1.3 completely norm, including t3. I had my tsh checked this year and now it's 2.1 and my free t4 is 1.1.

I went in for an eye exam 2 days ago and with an Optomap machine my optometrist found the following: ""Choroidal nevus about 2DD oval with distinct borders at 12 o clock in mid periphery. Hole at 4 o clock in far periphery with surrounding floaters."" I received a referral letter and saw an ophthalmologist yesterday at Kaiser. They dilated my eyes and did their own exam which confirmed what my optometrist had found. The doctor told me then that he would have me be seen by their retinal specialist next Wednesday the 24th (I was under the impression this was the retinal specialist and that it would be addressed then but it was their own consultation). It's been almost 24 hours since my eyes were dilated and this morning I woke up with my left eye a little bit blurrier than yesterday. I'm still seeing those after image flashes. Could the eyedrops they used yesterday still have this effect today? I was very sensitive to light the entire evening yesterday. They used 0.5% proparacaine/2.5% phenylephrine/1% tropicamide.

Have any of you experienced severe dry eye in just one eye at a time? I'm trying to determine if I am experiencing hay fever/allergies or if it could be early symptoms showing of Sjogrens. There's a possibility that it's BOTH, but I'm not sure if the allergen is in the air or a dog I have been around lately. Thanks In advance. "
10283,"I'm 45. Left good eye has been stable and seeing 20/20 with glasses, until recently. Since two months ago, I started seeing ghosting double image. Within weeks it tripled, quintupled, and now when I see a light, I see a small ring of lights making a circular pattern. I'm also desparately looking for treatment. Not just settling for CXL. Willing to do CXL + treatment. Also looking for doctor in NY/ NJ area. "
10284,"Absolutely it is. I recall my mom always picking at my ears as a kid having ear aches, swimmers ears but no one can seem to tell me if I had tubes? Hopefully the ENT this time will listen. Took them 15 years to find my lupus!! Such a long journey! My lord if only dr would Listen. "
10285,"Like most of you, I've had to reconsider and reorganize many parts of my life while battling dry eyes, including what I can realistically pursue. Originally I wanted to work on CGI for film, but you can imagine that went out the window as my eyes got worse. I was wondering if you guys have any dry eye friendly career ideas? Namely jobs that involve minimal computer use and aren't in a dry AC environment. I realize that 95% of jobs involve computer use nowadays and that's why it's hard for me to come up with interesting options. Let me know if you've got anything, thanks in advance. "
10286,"I am a student applying to optometry school after being pre-pharm + a pharm tech for 3 years, so take my opinion as such. Optometrists are well more respected than pharmacists by patients. A very large amount of your interactions with patients as a pharmacist will be negative, and most will think that your job is counting pills or ""slapping a label"" on the box. I am not exaggerating or joking. While shadowing optometrists, I have seen VERY few upset patients and the majority of them were happy to be there. That is one of the main reasons that I am switching. If you are asking to decide which field to go into, I would avoid pharmacy at all costs. Out of the 20+ pharmacists I have met, only one of them have actually said that they liked their job. The rest of them want out badly. The salaries are getting lower and lower and it is almost impossible to find a full time job. If you would like to talk more about pharmacy, I would be happy to answer any questions. Feel free to message me. If you do end up going the route of pharmacy, I could still give you some useful information to help you along the way. "
10287,"Thanks for replying. I appreciate the feedback. Is that the same thing as central serous chorioretinopathy? My appointments with the retina specialist and glaucoma specialist are in 2 weeks and a month from now. Is this wait going to be an issue for me? Whatever it is, I'd like to stay on top of it and get it resolved ASAP. That being said, the issues that occurred over the weekend aren't present at the moment. I don't know if my sugar levels are an issue. I was pre-diabetic less than two years ago and since then I've been tracking my sugar and eating no more than 30 grams per day. Recently, I was eating an ice cream bar (12 grams of sugar) before going to sleep. Also, since this happened, I'm making sure I get at least eight hours of sleep. The recent change in time kinda threw me off and I was getting like six hours only. Are there any other lifestyle changes that you would recommend? I'm going to order sunglasses (I'm in Florida) and I'm going to start exercising. Most importantly, I'm focusing on keeping my stress levels down. I get stressed and go into a rage internally and I'm realizing that's going to send me to an early grave if I continue to let things bother me mentally and emotionally. "

10289,"I put on a contact lens inside out last week, and I couldn't pull it out. I didn't know the contact lens was already broken into 2 pieces in my eye so I pulled off a ""chunk""<U+009D> of my cornea (or scratched, I don't know how deep it was) trying to pull out that contact lens. The eye doctor told me I could either use a band-aid or stem cell treatment, whereas the band-aid is just temporary, the stem cells will be permanent. It was too painful and I was scared of having a blurry eye for the rest of my life so I paid premium for the stem cell treatment. I know cornea heals pretty quick so tbh I don't even know if I really needed that. So I put on this Prokera membrane thing on my eye for 5.5 days and my cornea is healed completely, I have my vision back. Now that the doctor recommend using Muro 128 for the rest of my life to reduce the chance of tearing my cornea again. I'm under 30, so the idea of needing any medication for life is scary. I get using it for a few months, but for life? I don't have any underlying eye problems, shouldn't this ""new/regenerated""<U+009D> cornea a part of my eye? Or is this some external cells that my body would decide to reject in the future? I haven't found anything online about Prokera failure, even if I did they are all talking about dry eye treatments. This is expensive and annoying, any thoughts about the usage of Muro 128? "
10290,"In my opinion endmyopia is a confusing mess, but there's some useful information hidden inside. By no way I am promoting it, but I hope people give a chance to the reduced lens method in general. As someone who has spent a decade trying out all the vision improvement methods out there, and failed until recently, the branch of ""reduced lens method"" is the only one that has given me quantifiable results. Although there are no agreed scientific explanations to why it would work, that doesn't mean it doesn't work at all (just like you can build muscle mass without a paper detailing the mechanism involved). Otherwise I would not be able to read the computer screen without glasses even though 2 years ago I was at -3D and needed -1.75 to see it comfortably. It wasn't easy, nor fast. I still have to wear glasses for distance and some days my eyes can't focus properly without glasses. But this is more than I was expecting. Besides, science has pretty much proven by this point that full prescription and close work are tightly related. There's pseudomyopia and lens-induced myopia. I know people who only started needing glasses after landing a desk job, perhaps in most cases the genetics are more about a predisposition for the eyes to adapt more than a fixed error manifesting itself. I believe there are many factors involved to myopia progression, so it's unfair to just throw yes/no answer with absiolute conviction. How close they stare and for how many hours every day? Have they been using their full prescription for near work? Do they stay unnaturally still, favoring the muscles involved in accomodation to get tight faster? Are they suffering from a spasm of accomodation? Are they tense or stressed? Can their eyes finish the focusing attempt in the time between each blink? And the studies that say that using weak glasses make vision worse are not necessarily wrong. In fact you *can* develop some transient astigmatism and/or lose the extra range your eyes were able to accomodate. I have met many pitfalls in my quest to see better, as I said in another post: If I have to pinpoint what are the factors that can make vision worse or better, I'd say it's the ability to accomodate distance, the quality of the image, and the vision habits. It's like there's a threshold, for both directions of accomodation, that can progress/reduce myopia. Because they eyes can and will try to accomodate further away to an extent, if they are in the condition to do so, you'll experience asthenopia just as you do from looking too close, hell I've even felt muscles cramp inside the eye more than once, it has been a bumpy ride. When I started doing the practice properly, getting my eyes to focus just a little further was a real challenge, it took tens of seconds and they would start giving a burning sensation very quickly. I thought it was just the resulting tears giving me delusions of seeing better. However, in the long run they started focusing faster, for longer, and without tears. I've been holding my eyesight at the very edge of what my eyes could clear, for two years. This has improved my baseline perfect vision to 36-37cm (indoor), which becomes ~60cm with accomodation. I can in theory even see sharp up to 1m but astigmatic blur is unclearable at that distance and indulging it makes my vision worse. By experience, astigmatic blur is probably the main culprit the worsening in those studies that say weaker glasses lead to worse vision. I've experienced a temporary kind when switching to weaker glasses, along asthenopia and headaches, but that kind seem has never lasted more than 2-4 days if endured. I've got acquainted with another similar kind that shows up when looking at poor imagery that the vision can't clear. I had to get closer or look at better stuff (like black-on-white text) for 15 to 30 minutes to recover from it. Both of these made me see worse even when using full prescription glasses, due to completely random astigmatism, not even the axis was stable when I tried to measure it. An then there's another kind of astigmatism, more stable, that shows up as I lower spherical blur. This is more long term and requires months to deal with and is what I'm struggling with currently (it got harder the lower I got). I would imagine that someone who has not experienced these behaviors might panic and risk getting improper prescriptions. Eyes can adapt too much than they get credit for. In fact we'd all be happier if they didn't adapt at all. Ultimately, finding out how/why all of this works is a researcher's job. I can only share my experiences, Outside of reddit I met other two people with a similar starting point and rate of progress who underwent similar pitfalls, but everyone is different, I don't know how much what I wrote can be applied on general terms. I'm neither a researcher nor an optometrist. I haven't abandoned glasses completely, but I can see better. I can work at the computer without having to constantly clean the glasses from the accumulating grime, Even if I never reach 20/20 that's a big step ahead in QoL. "
10291,"OK, got it. Bear in mind that because I've never examined you, and I'm not your doctor, all I can do is make general comments--I can't diagnose you, much less advise you on what you should do (except in very general terms like 'See a doctor.') With all this in mind... I can't tell you with 100% certainty that your IOP spike wasn't from the steroids. But I *can* tell you that steroid-induced IOP spikes almost **never** happen in less than two weeks of treatment. Further, it is almost unheard of for the IOP to get into the 40s in such a short period of time. So unless you've got the duration of treatment wrong, it is very unlikely that this was steroid-induced ocular hypertension. I can also tell you that receiving 4 drops each of two anti-glaucoma meds in a short period of time is very, very unlikely to have caused you to develop uveitis. There is simply nothing in the literature of which I'm aware to support this. It is true that one of the drops (Trav) is rarely (1%) associated with the development of anterior uveitis--but not because of using it in a loading-dose fashion as was done here. Further, prostaglandin-induced uveitis is mild, and usually takes a while to develop. Again, very unlikely. So what *did* happen? I suspect your initial 'pink eye' was in fact anterior uveitis owing to a virus. These can present with minimal cell on exam, and are thus easily missed/misdiagnosed. Your 'pink eye' was treated with a weak steroid, which did nothing. You subsequently developed *viral trabeculitis*\--inflammation of a portion of the eye important to controlling IOP. Viral trabeculitis is a classic cause of the sudden, sharp IOP rise you experienced. Once you were put on the (much more potent steroid) Pred Forte, the trabeculitis was brought under control, and your uveitis (and elevated IOP) resolved. As for your floaters... They can certainly be related to your uveitis. You have been told you have vitreous synchesis and a partial PVD. These are not normal events in a 22 y.o. eye. The only ocular history you've given to explain these findings is the uveitis. Uveitis can cause floaters directly (usually in the anterior vitreous) as well as induce vitreous synchesis/syneresis and PVD. The next time you go in for an eye exam, ask the doctor to inspect your irises **before** you are dilated. Many individuals with a history of viral uveitis manifest subtle iris changes that can only be detected in the undilated state. If those changes are present, it would be very strong evidence that yours was in fact an episode of viral uveitis. "
10292,"They did make them according to the prescription (assuming no errors, which happen). But the default for many doctors would be to write you a prescription for about 18 inches away. If you ask the doctor to update your prescription to your computer distance the optician may have a policy to change that at no charge. Or if you want progressive lenses or trifocals that give more coverage you may need to pay the difference in price. How that works with insurance will be at you optician's discretion so I can't answer that one. "
10293,"How bad was your eye site before, and how good is it now? I am UK based and very interested in hearing more :) I had the CXL over ten years ago. Do you think this would matter? (Id assume not?). "
10294,"OP hasn't worn contacts for two years, he says. One-day contacts like Dailies Total 1, Oasys, MyDay and BioTrue have good reputations for comfort but it's very individual. If you've had problems, you'll want to try more than one of them. They come in trial packs of five or ten. "
10295,Typically any difference between both eyes of 4 or more would set off some red flags. Anything above 22 is a red flag for us as well. However some people just naturally have higher pressures than the average. However I would get it checked out again. The Optometrist may have you come in a couple times a week to repeatedly check pressures in order to get a good average and see if anything is wrong. 
10296,"I'm at the age where I need progressives (first time for me). My numbers are -1.5/-2.0 for sphere, and -0.25 for cylinder. The ""Add"" is +1.25. Axis is 90/160. My question: I know digital progressives really help when you need a strong prescription. I'd like to know if it's worth paying the premium for my prescription numbers. Edited to add: I am currently considering a premium progressive (not standard) but it is not digital. I have to go up on higher tier to get digital. I use a computer all the time for work. Single monitor, not too big (24""). Have no idea if that size with the distance I have will need a wider field of view. Thanks. "
10297,"For the past one year my 14yr old son has been suffering with dry, itchy, red, eyes that would get giant chalazions and styes. We've gone to optometrists, ophthalmologist and a cornea specialist. Not one has helped except he's been put on steroids, ointments, otc drops and hot compress every day for the past year. Three months ago when we saw the cornea specialist he said that his eyes had improved very slightly, even after being on medication for so long. I was very worried about his eyes so I started thinking back to what he was eating that could have caused all this inflammation. During that year, he had started eating eggs every single day. We decided to eliminate the eggs. In less than two months, his eyes no longer needed medication and the glands cleared up. We just got home from the ophthalmologist who confirmed this. If you are having trouble with your eyes please look into your diet. You could be eating something you are allergic to that is causing this inflammation. I only joined this group to post this hoping that it would help someone else. Good luck! "

It felt like I had keratoconus my whole life! Like I've never seen real life like that before! Like red is not the red I used to see even when I was 15 yo. I dunno I want an explanation if someone got one. Am I the only one ? Things seem beautiful.

10305,I was looking for a third opinion on some swelling I have been having for the past 4 months on my eyelid. That has been affecting my vision and been a discomfort. June 24th: Slight Tenderness in my eyelid. Very minor swelling. Used a hot compress before bed. June 25th: Woke up with my eye swollen shut and went to urgent care. Can be seen in the first picture. Told I had a Hordeolum and was prescribed Amoxicillin for 7 days. June 29th: Appointment with my optometrist. Was taken off the Amoxicllin because there wasn't any progress and was put on Levoflaxin and Neomycin-PolyDexamet eye ointment. Told I had a chalazion. There was some progress with this. July 6th: Appointment with ophthalmologist 1. Prescribed tobradex and told to observe. July 13th: Appointment with ophthalmologist 1. Told to continue tobradex and told to observe. July 23th: Appointment with ophthalmologist 1. Removed the chalazion prescribed tobradex and said I wouldn't need to follow up until my yearly eye appointment. Felt like this doctor was always in a rush to get me out of the office ASAP and dismissive. August 21: Made an appointment with another ophthalmologist 2. Diagnosed me with papular conjunctivitis. Had him take a picture for me under my eyelid. Can be seen in the picture. He injected a steroid into my eyelid. He prescribed me bacitracin ointment in case I was allergic to the tobradex. Gave me a weeks worth of samples of cequa and prescribed me 6 days of prednisone. September 4th: Appointment with ophthalmologist 2. Not much progress. Prescribed me a stronger dose of prednisone and switched me to xiidra eye drop prescription. Didn't want to do another injection as there was some leftover from last time in the eyelid still. September 18th: Picture can be seen of my current state as of today. There is still quite a bit of swelling that hasn't changed much for the past 2 months. You can still see a slight leftover of the 2 white dots where the steroid was injected. I have another appointment with ophthalmologist 2 coming up and just wanted to make sure I was on the right path to recovery and possibly get another opinion. Thanks!! 
10306,"25M. About 8 months ago I started wearing contacts. I only wear -1.00 (with astigmatism correction) and -1.25 in my eyes. I wear Acuvue daily disposables. The last month or so it really seems like my far-away vision has gotten worse with the contacts in, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it always was that way. I can see and read everything clearly but I seem to notice that far-away writing on signs is a little bit blurry; it's not completely clear. Also, some days I feel like my contacts just aren't sitting right on my eyes to the point where that is potentially causing the slight blurriness at far-away distances. Sometimes if I look left or right the contacts seem to not stay on the center of the eye properly and I get temporary distortion. Is this kind of thing just a normal little annoyance that comes with wearing contacts, or is there more of an issue here? "

(I thought vision stops progressing at 25 yo?), so I was wondering why their vision kept getting worse since starting school 3 years ago. Is it from strain from studying & screen time? Would enlarging screen text slow myopia progression by decreasing the amount of effort the eyes have to do to accommodate close-up objects? "
10309,"If you can, be sure to get your pain meds and prescriptions before the procedure so you can take them immediately after it's over. I made the mistake of waiting and I was in pain for a couple hours since the numbing medication wore off pretty quickly. Drink PLENTY of water. Your eyes will be really dry and although the drops help, you want to stay hydrated which will help keep your eyes naturally lubricated as well.

10314,"I have to wait until the middle of August before I can see a professional ophthalmologist about this, so I'm posting this here to see if anyone has any suggestions as to what I should be doing to alleviate this issue. Diagnosed with Hydrocephalus July 2019. Papilledema. Swelling of both optic nerves. Completely back to normal now, swelling gone. Started having issues looking at computer monitor screen April 2020. - Blurriness, dizziness, eye strain, eye watering. Ordered Blue Light Filter glasses. Helped a lot initially. Ocassionally used A.Vogel Moisturising Eye Drops on bad days. OCT scan - Monday 22nd March 2021. Given Eye Drops - Hycosan Dual - 3 times a day. Given Eye Ointment - Hycosan Night - Once at night. Symptoms still worsening. Other things tried: - 20-20-20 rule. I have a google extension that reminds me every 20 minutes to look away from the screen for a short while to rest my eyes. - Warm Compress 2 to 5 times a day. Rice in sock. Antibacterial Hot Eye Compress Heat Bag by The Eye Doctor. Eyelid Massage after using. - Omega 3 fish oil (2000 to 3000mg a day) - Bought a humidifier for my room. Had no noticeable effect, and I'm not from a warm country anyway. - Systane Complete Eye Drops. - Siccasan eye gel. Sorry for the formatting of this post, I've just copied and pasted what I had written down for the doctor I will be meeting in August and I don't know how to format it for Reddit. Another question I have is what is the intended goal of the warm compress? When I use the rice in the sock, it definitely seems to make my eyes secrete oils much more than the heat bag I bought specifically for doing a warm compress. Is the point to make my eyes water as much as possible? And is there a possibility I could damage my eyes with this heat? I usually heat up my sock for 30 seconds at about 800w, and typically wait about a minute for it to cooldown a little. Edit: Also worth mentioning that I only seem to have major issues when looking at my computer monitor rather than my television or phone, especially if I'm playing a game but also just in general. I am roughly 65cm to 68cm away from my 24 inch computer monitor screen at all times. Also probably worth mentioning I am 23 years old. "
10315,"If there are no changes in your distance refraction after having LASIK, you should be good until your mid-40's when you'll need reading specs. Try the contact lenses first, them if you want to make it permanent, do the LASIK. "
10316,"I think what you just said is a very rational approach, and given the risks, if they are bothering you so much you're willing to risk infection, then they obviously are a serious hinderance on your life. I think the real challenge would be finding an ophthalmologist to do a vitrectomy strictly for floaters. Like others said, it's a risky procedure, and at 40 with good vision, few surgeons may be willing to take on that risk. And the ones who WOULD take on the risk, may not come highly recommended. If you find a well rated surgeon who would be willing to move forward with you, then that's awesome! Until then, I would reserve that as a final option and pursue some of the other suggestions in the forum first. If all else fails, YAG. If no YAG, then think about this route. Yet I would also add that if floaters are bothering you this much, think about how much a retinal detachment/cataract, any complication would bother you if things went south. Things to ponder. "

10319,"Hello again everyone, so I have had something eating at me for a while now. I'm 26, wear classes for myopia as I can't see well far away without them. Around a year ago, I had lazy eye in my left eye, meaning I couldn't see through it properly even with glasses (which I do have.) There was a method I saw online about eyepatching the dominant eye for 2 hours every day. I committed to this. Surprisingly, it worked. At first, it was temporary if I did not do it now and again, but it is permanently fixed as of a few months after starting treatment with the eye patch sessions being once every day for 3 weeks and once every 3 days until the end of the third month. However, while what I can't figure out didn't happen right away, my right eye's vision has degraded heavily. I have seen both an Optician (two different ones, a month apart) and an optometrist once which was not long after the first optician visit. The last visit was around 2 weeks ago. This degradation of my right eye isn't due to it worsening as for whatever reason it can't be corrected by glasses anymore. It's really bad too. If I am not at least a foot away from my 17.3' screen, I can't read any text on old reddit. I can't see it clearly unless 3-5 inches away from my screen. Despite this, my acuity is still 20/20 with glasses because I could still sort of read the last letters. Also, eye pressure and all other things have been checked by the entomologist, my eyes are healthy. Since I have 20/20 with the right eye and glasses, what could be causing this? What is the term for what I'm experiencing? It's not low vision as I'm still in the range for it not to be. I have a suspicion that it's lazy eye that developed, but unlike when I started treatment for the left eye, I haven't seen noticeable improvement for my right eye after doing it for a week. I also told the optician about the lazy eye and how I suspected I developed it in my right eye after curing the left, but he said ""There's no way that could happen."". I'm kind of going crazy over this because it's so bad that it actually worsens my vision with my left eye if open compared to when it's closed. I'm ready to just ask for it to be removed because of this and I really don't want to have to do that. It's messing up my vision though, and it's frustrating to work with on top of my visual snow and double vision/ghosting that has only been increasing in severity. Anyone who could help, I would greatly appreciate it. EDIT: I did forget to mention one thing. I have no idea if it matters or not, but I can improve my vision by tilting my lens from my glasses downward or upward. While it warps the vision, it clears things up quite a bit though not fully. I do not recall if this was the case for my left eye when it had lazy eye. "

10323,"26F here. Got diagnosed right before 25th birthday so it's been like a year and some months. I went through months of dry mouth before being diagnosed (not on any meds btw) and a few months after my stress levels decreased & now I'm like 85% back to normal. My mouth is drier than before but definitely not as bad as those few months where I was stressing. When the pandemic hit and we went on lockdown I got two styes which I have never had before and I was told it was stress related not Sjogren's related, but I fear of getting dry eyes. I have not had dry eyes as some people here describe it, just dry mouth for my symptom. So I do fear it will get worse if I stress out like before, but i'm glad to know there's many meds out there to help & this community! And Of course my Dr who knows of Sjogren's. Basically just trying to say that in my experience I haven't gotten worse even with the pandemic & everything else crazy going on around the world. "

10325,"I used co-codamol 30/500 for 3 days, but that's totally optional, I was in a bit of pain and not everyone experiences that. I had 4 different eye drops.

10326,"No, you're not on the cusp of presbyopia... you're only 22. Presbyopia onset between 40-50yo. You have more eye strain that occurs in young people who spend a lot of time studying and are on devices a lot. It's not really your fault as we are not made to read up close... if you stopped reading completely you wouldn't have these headaches and eye strain issues anymore. However, this is not practical as you are aware. Hence anti-fatigue lenses are the way to go. Anti-fatigue and progressive lenses are similar but not exactly the same - but the differences are quite complicated to go into and we would need to go imto the optics of lens design. For your knowledge.... I generally prescribe anti-fatigue lenses for younger people who are getting headaches and eye strain - that small +0.75 add on top your prescription just keeps you from fatiguing as early. Can't go straight single visions distance as you can't see far away. "
10327,"So I've been dealing with an unknown vision issue for the last few months and it's been driving me crazy. I'm a nineteen year old male with ADHD, I take adderall for my disorder, and I also wear prescription glasses for my nearsightedness. While I used to run through prescriptions basically every six months, this one seems to have lasted the longest possibly due to the blue light filter it has. The only issues I've had with these glasses was that when I got them my right eye seemed to be quite a bit weaker than my left, and that a lot of times car lights tend to be big balls in the dark (astigmatism possibly?). They hadn't bothered me at all though until around March. I've just noticed that when I turn my head or move my eyes to focus on something else, it's like my eyes can no longer immediately focus on what I'm trying to look at. It's like they're constantly trying to adjust to everything I look towards. It might seem trivial to some but it can be super annoying to someone like me who notices every little unimportant detail. Can this be caused by a prescription, even if that certain prescription doesn't seem to be deteriorating visually? I'd like to hear what other people have to say about this, because for months now I've considered so many different things that could cause this, but because I have no idea what I'm dealing with I don't have a clue. All helpful answers are appreciated. EDIT: Forgot to mention I do also suffer from TMJ, and when there's too much stress around the right side of my jaw, it can cause dizziness/disorientation. "
10328,"Oh god there is so much to type, lol. Ill short hand it. Rgp can be unsafe if you're not stable. A perfectly fitted rgp is no risk, but if your eyes progress at all, its now not perfectly fitted, and risks touching the cornea, risking scarring or aggrivating the condition. Sclerals are ""invisible"" once in, you shouldnt feel them. Sclerals are a 'cornea shield'; if you wipe or rub your eyes, you're not touching your cornea. Ive had kerarings (had removed 7 years later). Tried every soft lens option. Tried rgp. Nothing compared to miniscleral. I personally like my Comfort15. I have them in a steep edge profile, so they ""dig in"". No leaking, and no visible edge for my eyelid to feel. 15mm is the smallest a miniscleral can be, and they're super cheap. Ordered in from the UK. Takes about a week to arrive here in Australia. ZENlens is the most configurable, but you'll pay for that.... RoseK is (theoretically; unproven) the healthiest lens, as its designed to leak (fresh tears, healthier eyes?) But you might feel the edges. Ummm... CAT lenses out of Brisbane, Australia are apparently amazing; they're my next pair, but at double the cost of the Comfort 15's? Its a hard sell. "

10330,"At your age, your myopia progression should start to slow down naturally within the next couple of years. While FDA approved for children 8-12 years old, CooperVision MiSight contacts could possibly help slow down your myopia. I would consider atropine therapy as well if you want to get very aggressive with myopia control. Talk to your eye doctor about these options. how can I update my lifestyle to aid my control of myopia as I really want to be legible for LASIK surgery. Not much you can do to significantly control your myopia with regards to lifestyle at your age. But try to give your eyes plenty of breaks when doing near work (take a 20 second break every 20 minutes looking far away). Spending time outdoors (with appropriate UV protection) wouldn't hurt as well either - although outdoor activities seem to affect myopia progression at younger ages. I wouldn't even think about refractive surgery options such as LASIK until you are 25 years old. "
10331,"I just want to add I tried reading on my phone without the contact in my right eye. Without my contact, the near vision in my right eye is better. If I compare, my Panoptix eye is not as good as that eye. With both eyes open it is fine and even with just my Panoptix eye I can do it, just have to focus harder on the smaller type. This feels really hard to explain. I just don't want you to think your near vision will be exactly the same with Panoptix since you are so young. My guess would be that with your other eye 20 20 you will be fine right away and in 10-15 years enjoy the built in readers that the Panoptix gives you. "
10332,"Hey guys, So this July I got a new prescription and it wasn't working out. I was seeing blurred still , so they fixed it with a new prescription again which was OD 2.00 & OS 1.75. They were great at first I could seen pretty clear (this was in July). Then just recently I started to feel like my vision was slightly blurry at things in a distance. I just couldn't see as clear as I would like it to be. It was really bad at night I can't see street signs clearly it's really frustrating. So today I went to my eye doctor and she gave me a new prescription I can see good out of which was OD 2.50 and OS 2.25. But she didn't have a reasoning for me of how this changed so quickly. I'm 21 female healthy no other health problems. No family history of diabetes. She suggested I go get blood work done to get tested for diabetes. I have been spending a lot of time on my phone since the pandemic. Can that have something to do with this ? I'm starting get worried. "
10333,"I saw the optometrist to get new glasses last week. I asked him about my PD, and he said it was 55 and average is 63. I have a VR headset, but the lowest setting for the PD is 60. He said it may cause eye strain, but my prescription is low (one eye is 20/30 the other is 20/40) so it's not too concerning. I'd like to get a second opinion? Is this going to cause long term damage to my vision? "
10334,"30yo with myopia. Over the past year I've noticed more floaters but I've been putting off an appointment due to the pandemic. Finally made one for a month from now because the things I read about RD scare me. Floaters of course are more noticable while looking at sky, but I have one dark spot that happens sometimes and it can scare me because it looks like something scurrying. I was reading floaters are often harmless but to watch out for flashes of light. I do get brief flashes, I'm sure it happens multiple times a day but it's not constant or severe. Would RD be constant? No curtain or anything but I'll need a higher prescription I think partly due to the pandemic and staring at screens even more than usual. I also have nystagmus. "
10335,"Immunosuppressants aren't necessary for all who have Sjogrens. The first line of treatment, if it suits a person's symptoms, is Plaquenil which is an anti-malarial. I was initially on that to treat lupus, ten years before I had Sjogrens symptoms. After having to stop Plaquenil, my doctor put me on Imuran (generic is Azzthiorprine). After I moved to a different state, my new doctor suggested I try discontinuing Imuran because it increases the risk of cancer, particularly skin cancer and lymphoma. Luckily that worked out well for me in that the lupus has not been very active for years. Then I got Sjogrens. I treat the Sjogrens symptoms with Evoxac / Cevimeline, a variety of products, vitamins and supplements, an anti=inflammatory diet, stress management and exercise. Sometimes, but rarely, I need steroid eyedrops. "

Steep edges make the lens ""sink into"" the sclera, so there's no edge for the eyelid to feel. What style of scleral lens are they?

10337,"Hi, so I can only speak from my limited experience of having a transplant that's a bit over a month old. As far as I am aware there will be at least one drop a day for as long as the cornea lasts and I will probably have to keep using the moisturising drops too. Other downsides during recovery are that I cannot do any weightlifting / lifting exercises for at least 4 months. Recovery is exhausting in terms of reminding yourself of all the things you shouldn't do (don't touch your eye, no dust no nothing should get into your eye, don't exhaust yourself etc). And after the big things are over and you are kind of used to the new routine, you might have a longing for how easy the small things were before the transplant. Now I have to: - Wash my hair without getting shampo into my eye (a challenge as my last haircut was two months ago) - getting outside being paranoid that small things might get into my eye from the wind - only allowed to cycle with protecting glasses - sunshine being too bright even with sunglasses - not able to spent much time in front of the screen yet (hopefully only 2 more weeks) - going to regular appointments (monthly for me right now) - slowly trying to adjust to normal life again while I seemingly watched my peers hustle and get on with things while I just sleep and try to recover - due to lots of time doing nothing, I also have lots of time to think about the very unhelpful ""what if""<U+009D>s: what if I have to have this surgery every 5 years? What if the transplant doesn't survive the next few months? Sorry this is a bit long and turned into a rant. I might be a bit overreacting as today has been a bit of a difficult recovery day. Of course I am forever grateful and thankful that tgere is at least this solution and I can already see more than I did before surgery. Makes it all worth it, it's just not a walk in the park. (I'm 28/M, first diagnosed 2015 (if I remember correctly)). "

10341,"Hi, I'm 38 and my rx is +1,75 and +2,25. I work as graphic designer, so I spend lots of time in front of the computer. Lately, my eyes started getting quite tired towards the end of the day. When that happens, reading books or my phone becomes hard, but far away, it's no problem. Depending on how tired I am, some days I'll be totally ok with my current prescription, others I really feel I need the extra help to read. After an exam, my optometrist suggested adding a +.85 boost for reading to my current prescription. I've had the new lenses for a couple weeks now and I'm hating this two in one lens. I notice the blurriness on the sides of the bottom area a lot, and even though I see better on the stronger area when my eyes are tired, the blurriness is driving me crazy. I notice it all the time, and when working on my big screen, I do have to move my head to see things sharp instead of just moving my eyes. I really miss the wide field of view of my previous single prescription. Because of this, I'm considering just getting two different pairs of glasses. One without the ADD part and another for when I feel tired. Now my question: are there any blended bifocals that don't have this type of blurriness or is that expected from any lens other than a single prescription? It'd be convenient to have both in one, but if it's not possible, I'd rather stick to two separate glasses and get the best of both. Thanks for the advice,. "
10342,"27 correct? In a prev post you mentioned you were diagnosed with lower back pain and arthritis in the lower back...23 years ago? At 4 years old? Anything for that? Are you a hypochondriac with anxiety? Bc you've made multiple posts about the many other things you think you may have. You've visited MULTIPLE doctors and have made multiple posts on this problem in the span of a couple weeks. Have you thought maybe... contacts just aren't for you? Ophthalmologists barely deal with contacts and have nowhere near as much experience as optometrists in that field but sure you can try that. Doubt you're going to get any different answers than the ones you've already gotten. Instead of constantly throwing money at doctors, why not use that money towards therapy instead? You're probably not gonna listen so whatever, maybe 100th time's the charm right? Good luck. "

10346,After visiting my ophthalmologist his determination is that I don't have glaucoma. My eye pressures are still around 30. His conclusions are my cornea is much thicker which allows pressures this high. Optic nerves looks fine. I'm relieved. He believes the blurry vision could be a migraine episode.

10348,"I just had a talk with my mother (71 years old) about her eyesight which left me quite confused. So this is how she got glasses: As a kid she first noticed something was different with her vision was , when she was not able to find a needle that dropped on the floor. Her mother on the other hand was able to find it, but it was impossible for her as the needle was just too tiny for her to see - so she was quite confused. As school started she had problems to see the board as the writing there was too small for her. At that point they went to a doctor and she was prescribed glasses with about +4 diopters. Then she was able to see much better , as now everything was much closer and bigger to her. In the beginning she was then often falling when she went up the stairs as the distance of the stairs was now different to her. This is what confuses me. I thought that being farsighted means close objects are blurry , whereas being short sighted means distant objects are blurry. Both conditions are related to blurryness but not to the perception of distance/size, or? She is not experiencing any blurryness, but due to the glasses, to her the distance changes ! She says when she takes off the glasses everything is just much smaller to her. This is also why she never knew what to answer if someone asked her is she was near or farsighted , because to her near and far seems clear, it's just more distant without glasses. I'm quite confused! I thought with 4+ diopters everything close to her would just be very blurry. I haven't been able to find any description on this condition. Is there a name for it ? The first time she went to the doctor he mentioned that she was born like this, but she doesn't remember anything else. "

10350,"Not a doctor, but an undergrad in retina research. I can't speak for your case specifically, but some info on clinical myopia: Severe myopia is caused by the elongation of your eyeballs which, like you said, leads to the retinal stretching, holes, and needing glasses. Holes in the center of your retina are one of the most concerning risks. Full-thickness holes, that essentially puncture all the way through to a certain retinal layer, could lead to severe lowered visual acuity. This is what the eye doctor is trying to watch on a yearly basis. If this were to happen and you got a sudden decrease in vision (i.e. overnight), there is surgery that inserts an oil or gas bubble that presses on the retina essentially to help reform the layers so visual acuity improvement is possible. There are other procedures as well. Full-thickness holes may form gradually and a way to track it is through an OCT which is a camera that captures all the layers of the retina. Another risk the eye doctor is watching for is fluid (Myopic Choroidal CNV) caused by stretching/tearing of these layers which is a serious risk as it should be treated within the first two weeks. Signs would be sudden vision loss. Fluid can be treated with an injection of an Anti-VEGF drug into the eyeball (Avastin is the cheapest and debatably equally effective drug). If injections don't work or if the fluid is in a large quantity in a certain part of your eye, a surgery can be done to suck out the blood. It's a 15-minute surgery with very low risk but myopic CNV has a pretty low 5-year prognosis in acuity. I'm not sure why they're asking for an ultrasound unless you had a recent hemorrhage (blood) that obstructs their view of seeing the retina, but I'm no doctor and I'm still learning, but an ultrasound is basically a device that looks like the end of a deodorant stick that they put on your closed eyes with gel on it. Your flashes and floaters are understandable but a sudden and drastic increase in floaters could mean a retinal detachment which is another risk. This is when the retinal layer pulls off the back of your eye. This can be fixed through surgery with another bubble and sleeping with a bubble in your eye uncomfortably for about a month. In terms of lifelong outlook (as you are only 16), there's unfortunately no cure for severe myopia, and it will always come with risks. Slow degeneration of the retina due to the 'stress' of the stretching will also be a constant. I do want to say that eyes fully develop by mid-20s so any large changes to your prescription once you're in your 20's is less likely. This is definitely a lot to take in and the fear of blindness is something I can relate to as well, so I'm sorry you are going through this. I do want to say that it's important to find a great doctor who you can form a relationship with for years to come. I guess another piece of hope is that if the doctor is asking for annuals rather than biannual visits, it doesn't seem like he is finding anything too drastic in the center of your vision that has a high risk of change any time soon. Also, I had heard/read that clinical myopia, of -8 or worse, may soon impact 10% of the entire world by 2050 due to kids (being 6 years or younger I believe) exposing their eyes to sunlight less and less with computers/phones being all we do nowadays. I'm not sure if you going outside more as a 16-year-old may help prevent worsening, and maybe another redditor can comment on this as I have much to learn, but it wouldn't hurt to spend time outdoors on a daily.

10351,"I just had a baby two months ago with Sjorens. They considered me high risk even though I probably wasn't, since I don't have any of the SSA or ANA antibodies. Either way, everything turned out fine. Between the cardiologist and MFM specialists, we probably had over 15 ultrasounds. The plus side was we got a little comfort each time knowing we were able to see the baby and keep tabs on his progress. I'd also like to add that I took plaquenil and he's totally fine. Currently breastfeeding and still on it. "
10352,"Why did your optometrist dismiss you? Do you have a history of staring at the sun? Macular degeneration does leave visible marks on your retina, so a eye doctor would visibly see it. Do you recall anything happening prior to it? Don't see them again, get an appointment with a ophthalmologist or at vary least a different optometrist. What did they say to you? They measured your pressure and I assume it was okay. Especially since you're 25, did they show you you're retina images? "

10357,"My parents keep telling me how i'd be getting headaches and stuff if i need glasses (18M). So i wonder what exactly causes headaches among myopics? 1. We all get random headaches, once in a while. Does myopia predispose us to more headaches or is related to strain? 2. I've read that headaches are strain related too. But what kinda strain? Like can we do close up work without straining our eyes, as myopes? I've seen people claiming that they strained their eyes by studying. Does it mean they were wearing glasses while studying too? This is another doubt i have, why do people really wear glasses while doing closeup work? Doesn't it make eyesight worser? 3. Is the strain induced by staring at distant objects without glasses? Or would we strain it with glasses too? 4. Can we prevent myopia induced headaches? "
10358,"I have pretty persistent sweating, just intermittent bouts where it rolls from various lymph glands down my skin in an obvious, wet fashion. Takes me right back to puberty. Some OTC deodorant stone things help me. These block the pores, so if I need to not sweat for just a couple hours and then hate myself later they do the trick. Benzoyl peroxide wash in the shower was prescribed to me for folliculitis; when I asked about sensitive mucus membranes the Derm said that they often use that wash for ""stinky parts"" but to avoid genitalia. I do find it helps for maybe 6/12 waking hours. One of my biggest controls is fabrics: different clothes make me sweat differently. Polyester and rayon produce more than cotton. Spandex oddly makes it sort of hard to notice, but the skin irritation later is awful. Rough fabric like jeans is a no-go anymore for the sweat+chaffing combo. "

This surgery I can recommend you, the best at the moment in the World with unbelievable results, I did it and it's a live changing method. If you can wait, then I would ask your doctor to do that, it's much more effective and faster healing. Athens Protocol = Cross linking Epi on + Topoguided T-PRK.

10361,"I'm getting progressives for the first time. I currently wear fairly large frames (non-progressive) as I wanted to maximize ""coverage"". Almost as large as Bill Gates's in the 80's. In general, I'm told that progressives are better with large frame sizes. But I've been given conflicting advice from two different optometrists. The first one said my picking a large frame size is not a problem as they are a better option for progressives. The second one said my current size is way too big for progressives and will cause problems. The rationales: 1. With progressives, the periphery will be blurry anyway, so I won't benefit from the larger field of view (i.e. I will need to turn my neck anyway instead of merely using my eye). 2. Also, with very large frames, reading things nearby (e.g. book) will force me to keep my head up and really work to point my eyeballs to the bottom of the frame. She said they can make the lens such that the reading zone is higher (i.e. not struggle looking so far down), but then I'm wasting the bottom portion of the lens anyway (will be blurry). She's recommending an ""average"" frame size. 3. My pupil needs to be roughly in the center of the frame, which is impossible to achieve if the frame is too wide and any progressive lens on it will be suboptimal. Given that I wear large frames only to maximize my field of view, and that the periphery will be blurry anyway with progressives, should I just get an average size frame? Not sure it's relevant, but my numbers are -1.5/-2.0 for sphere, and -0.25 for cylinder. The ""Add"" is +1.25. Axis is 90/160. "
10362,"The procedure is not in any way to stop ghosting. I can say that confidently. The act of cross-linking, at least epithelium off, is actually slightly destructive to the cornea. When I say slightly I mean it might take 10 to 20 microns off at most, but it will reshape it ever so slightly. This is not necessarily a calculated reshaping and could potentially end up making your vision worse or better, but realistically not a huge amount. It is possible that it will make your ghosting a little bit better, but it is also possible it will make it a little bit worse. If you end up having epithelium on, it's possible that it won't do either at all. But it is not a radically vision-changing surgery, epithelium off will radically change your vision for a couple of months but it will go back to basically exactly the same as before. I cannot personally speak for epithelium on. Many doctors, and when I say many I mean most of Europe, will say ""crosslinking"" or CXL when they actually mean epi-off with tPRK, which most definitely will fix your vision. As far as the status of that in the US, I haven't heard anything new on it but when I had my surgeries in 18 and 19 tPRK was not approved in the US yet, or at least that is what I seem to recall I could be mistaken about that. You got to realize that basically everybody on this subreddit wears contacts, specifically RGP's or scleral lenses (which are both the same thing, they just sit on different parts of the eye, RGPs touch the middle of the cornea, scleral lenses touch the white parts on the edges), because most of our vision is severe enough to warrant needing that instead of being able to use glasses. That being said, I don't know how bad your vision is but I have scleral lenses and they are really good for anything distance related, and luckily I am good enough vision to be able to see without them up close at the distance where my work from home, hobbies, and day to day life including putting around town is not affected by my vision. But nearly everybody here wears those lenses, and if yours is bad enough to really affect your life that much it's likely that you will have to as well. They take a little bit of getting used to but they're actually a bit better than glasses for most people because you can wear them all day and you basically forget about them once you've been wearing them for about a week or two. Plus they're really easy to put in and out, and they're much more comfortable than other contact lenses. All of that aside, I personally would really encourage you to ask your doctor why he is having you do it epi-on when it is measurably not as good as epi-off For your reading here are two articles that are fairly concise and plain English about the differences in efficacy between epion and epioff. I haven't thoroughly read them but I have skimmed a decent bit and they seem to confirm what I am fairly confident in so I feel they are good bit of reading. Make sure to do your own research on the difference though because that is basically the only thing that I am really concerned about with a lot of people is I had a really good doctor that really stuck it into my brain that epi-off is really that much better to warrant all the bitching and moaning that I'm doing about it, just because I can say personally I would rather have to be out for a week per eye than have to go back and get it done a second time and realize that my vision was getting worse the whole time. It's an extreme scenario, but I truly believe that that could possibly be the case and would be much worse than just having to deal with a bit of pain for a week. https://theophthalmologist.com/subspecialties/epi-on-or-epi-off https://www.reviewofophthalmology.com/article/crosslinking-tackling-the-big-questions I just read through this comment again and I realized I might not have been clear about it so I just want to reiterate. Keratoconus is a degenerative disease. There are a lot of diseases that can be very similar and mistaken for keratoconus, and the treatment is relatively the same, but real honest to God keratoconus will keep getting worse until later in life (at what point no one knows for sure, it is a person to person thing) And that degeneration can potentially cause really really bad eye effects. There is a guy on here, his name is u/curedofkc2 I believe and he is a great example of what happened before cross-linking was available, he had to get corneal transplants because his keratoconus got so bad. Luckily he is very happy and healthy with his transplants for a very very long time (much longer than average), but if he had had cross-linking when he was a child / young adult it is likely that he would have never had to have had corneal transplants in the first place. Cross-linking is to stop the progression of what is otherwise a long-term detrimental disease. Most doctors recommend cross-linking specifically to save what vision you already have on the off chance that it is going to continue progressing for a long time. It is a safe bet to get cross linking if you do have keratoconus even if you feel like you don't need it because it is one of those things that you really don't want to take a chance with of your vision getting much worse than it is right now. However, it is not for fixing your vision, it is just for making it not get worse. Sorry for the wall of words but hope that helps. "
10363,I am hypochondriac from last 1.5 year I started experiencing flashes of light in April and then did some test and that a brain MRI without consultation with doctor which turned out to be normal and then this thing went away on its own after a few weeks but now this week it came again so I decided to go to the doctor he did some basic eye test he said your eyes appear normal you just have is dry eyes. But in one of my test eye pressure was 23 and 22 . I was in anxiety also that time. He didn't mentioned that eye pressure is high. I went to him again next day to just check eye pressure. It was then 21 and 24. I was in anxiety again. Then next I went to do all the test again. But now the eye pressure was 21 and 19. My doctor said for some people even 25 is normal eye pressure. He said your eyes look healthy. There are no signs of glacoma at all. He said that now your eye pressure has even gone down. Can anxiety raise eye pressure? I am a very anxious person. 
10364,"Can anyone tell me why different lenses manufacturers have different clarity? For example, I am switching between newer generation Biofinity (160dk/t, silicone hidrogel) and older Bauch&Lomb's Softlens 59 (22dk/t), and Bauch&Lomb being much older and not very comfortable provide better vision clarity for me than Biofinity. Anyone here to explain me why this is happening? Thank you. "
10365,"From the standpoint of my own self-interest, is there a reason to shell out like 40-50 more bucks for the photo? If not, wondering why it costs more. "
10366,"I don't experience it always but its vivid when i am tired or sleepy. What happens is that, if i close my eyes for a couple of minutes and then open it, my vision would be flickering. Like not flashing and stuff, everything is flickering , it lasts like 10-20 seconds before going normal. Same experience while at bed, if i keep eyes closed i feel that my vision is flickering and when i open it , everything is flickering dimly if there's some light coming into the room. If its pitch dark then there's nothing. What could be it? I've not been able to get an appointment with a doc for months now. And possibly couldn't for like next 4-5 months. So i need to put myself at ease. I've been on phone/computer/books for a while now. Like for 2-3 months straight and stopping their use has been a little strange. Plus i'm a hypochondriac so each thing which happens scares the hell out of me. Most of these symptoms started popping up when i broke that phone usage streak (started lifting around the same time). Its been 3.5 months now. I initially was scared of PVD and RD. But its been 3+ months, so can i rule that out? My vision has been the same since then or prolly better since i minimized phone use. I hope this is not AMD too. Here are a couple of other symptoms i experience now (no vision/health issues rn, i don't wear glasses too, haven't been out of house for 8 months too). 1. Vision in the Left corner of my left eye vibrates at times. Like it keeps shaking. Only the visual extreme. 2. When i move my right eye downwards , i see a bright thread like flash at the bottom of eye. Prolly had it for a while but i've started noticing it more now. Never seen it any other time, mainly when sleeping and only when i do it. 3. Negative Afterimages. I used to confuse these with flashes a lot. I get a Neg Afterimage of narrow objects like phone wires, window grills etc when i stare at them for 5-6 seconds. The image lasts less than a second. But if i blink fast i can see the image repeatedly but it gets dimmer each time. Prolly takes 30s to be normal again. 4. Monocular Diplopia. I've had this for 5-6 years. Never affected me that much. I've used a PC for 10-12 hrs straight. No issues. Read books. But 1-2 hrs of phone gives me diplopia. Like a copy of the text under it. Its always contrasting texts in my case. Like white text on black background. And mainly seen this on TV when i look at it from 20+ feet away. Its not very well pronounced always, there've been days where i never had it , due to rest or no phone use. 5. Phosphene like stuff, totally random. Like idk when it comes. Sometimes i never see it. Its usually blue or purple in color. Like a flash. 6. Light backgrounds flash. Sometimes i get it, sometimes i don't. Like if i look at a light colored wall and blink it feels like the wall is flashing. Noticed more in dim settings. 7. Bright stuff gives me entoptic phenomena too. 8. Tired eyes. My eyes feel tired most of the time. Anything serious? Not looking for a diagnosis. I can think of digital eye strain and dehydration in my case. "
10367,"I (46M) have progressive lenses in my glasses only because my distance prescription is too strong for me to see up close, I basically need zero correction for reading and actually see better up close with my glasses off. If I wore contacts with my distance prescription I would need to use reading glasses with them. Would multi-focal or bi-focal contacts work for me? I have always been skeptical about them since I can't wrap my head around how you would go about looking through different parts of a contact lens. Any advice or experiences to share would be appreciated. Thank you in advance. "
10368,"I (25F) was diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis after being sick for nearly 2 years and seeing 4 Rheumatologists. The one who finally diagnosed it did it based on symptoms because my lab work and buccal and nasal biopsies are always ""unremarkable""<U+009D>. When I first got sick, I thought it was a sinus infection- headaches, fatigue, nasal irritation, and nosebleeds that turned out to be from a nickel-sized septal perforation. My ENT had my ANA tested and that positive result sparked this whole thing. Over the next year and a half or so after the initial symptoms expanded to include unbearable itching on my arms and legs (with no rash- thought to be dry skin), dry and itching eyes that feel like I have eyelashes in them constantly, increased dental issues, some numbness in both thighs, and arthritis in my hands & feet. The only things ever flagged in my bloodwork were my positive ANA, consistently elevated ESR, elevated white blood cells sometimes, and a positive SS-B. I want input from those who have real life experience. I don't agree with my doctor that GPA fits my symptoms, but could I be one of you? "
10369,"He already soaked them in hydrogen peroxide so it may not be viable - but he should bring them to his appointment with him and also bring his old lens case and OP - do not wash the old lens case! If you do have an ulcer, we can culture the old lenses. or the old case to help figure out what pathogen is causing the infection. Should go without sayig but obviously these lenses are never to be worn again (this was true 11 months ago) and the case is never to be used again. "
10370,"It is already curable\*. Just not safely or in a way that is currently profitable to pharma industry. Hematopoetic stem cell transplants can cure and have cured many autoimmune diseases. It is just a very toxic therapy that seems to have serious risks, like blood cancers, and it's not always efficacious. Whether those risks outweigh the benefit is hotly debated by both physicians and patients. It depends on a lot of factors like the severity of the autoimmune disease, age of the patient, transplant protocols performed, etc. Very complicated. This is obviously not profitable to pharma because there's no long-term medication involved, it's just an acute therapy, so it is probably less popular, in part, due to that simple fact, but also for reasons like risks. The way it works is that it wipes out long-live plasma cells in the bone marrow that produce antibodies. But not just pathogenic autoantibodies, ALL antibodies. It effectively destroys your immune system's memory. The goal is to somehow selectively target only the pathogenic long-lived plasma cells. This isn't the only plausible mechanism for a cure though. There is **lots** of research being conducted on restoring immune tolerance and in many different ways. There's rapamycin plus IL-2, Treg cell therapy, mesenchymal stem cell therapy, tolerogenic dendritic cells, antigen-specific therapy, mRNA vaccines, etc., etc. Just google ""Restoring immune tolerance"" and you will find many papers summarizing the different strategies and hypotheses being eplored. I think it would be a huge failure by medicine if there was not at least an effective ""cure"" for most autoimmune diseases by 2040 or 2050. I think true cures could be possible within 50 years, maybe even less. They are cureable. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Science will find a way. Edit: Do you have health anxiety? I see you've made a lot of posts asking about cures or the status of medical research for many different diseases, almost as a form of reassurance just in case you have or were to develop one of those diseases. Seeking reassurance might help you cope in the very short-term, but only makes health anxiety worse in the long-term. You may want to see a psychologist that specializes in OCD. "
10371,"So I've been digging a bit more and apparently SSA uses either 24-2 or 30-2 HFA with a stimulus size of III. I've got some tests that are using a stimulus size of V instead. If I understand correctly, the size V is larger which would possibly show better performance as compared with a size III. So in other words, a threshold value using size V might be better than if using a size III. Is this right? "

Then on an unrelated note I had cataract lens replacement surgery (it was vision correction for severe myopia). They got really really bad in the past month, either cause I stopped using xiidra, had the surgery, or started a desk job behind a computer. All these things happened exactly a month ago. There's days where I just can't handle it. I have crusty stuff under my eyelids 24/7. I do EVERYTHING: fish oil, vitamin D, TheraTears pills, a warm eye mask, etc...

10374,"I wouldn't hold out hope for stem cell treatment, in its current form, as a ""drastic"" change. I would say it's a promising and interesting change, but probably won't fully eliminate higher-order aberrations. In other words: we have no reason to see stem cell treatment for KC as a ""cure"" right now, and preemptive CXL (before HOAs appear) would still be the best option.

IMHO: Ask them what the issue is, and how to fix it. "
10378,"Muro-128 (over the counter) when you think you have a corneal scratch. Use it at night, after you take your lenses out. If it stings, that's usually an indicator of a scratch, so I leave one lens out until it heals. I've discovered that if I shower at night, instead of in the morning, I can't tolerate my lenses nearly as well. After 30 years of this, I still do not know why. Are you using baby shampoo when you wash your hair? That helped me, along with hypo-allergenic body wash instead of soap. Ask your fitter to test and see if your lenses are wetting properly as you blink. It's a simple, painless test, performed with only a sterile colored eye drop or dye from a special strip of paper. Good luck! "

10380,"Hello, I am so sorry you are going through all this. Being sick, especially with an autoimmune disease, really sucks. I have had diagnosed Sjogren's for 15 years. I am going to answer your questions one by one and hope this helps. 1. Sjogren's is an autoimmune disease that attacks your moisture producing glands. Basically what this means is that your immune system (the thing that fights off viruses and bacteria that make you sick) gets overexcited and attacks your moisture producing glands. In a healthy person, there immune system is able to distinguish between healthy organs and viruses or bacteria that are making you sick. People with autoimmune disease have an overactive immune system that cannot distinguish between organs and viruses. When you have what is called a flare or increase in immune system activity and symptoms your glands might get inflamed, swollen or sore. I am currently in a flare and my neck is all swollen from the lymph nodes being attacked. Your glands will not be destroyed or go away. 2. Autoimmune disease symptoms come and go with flares like I mentioned above. Everyone is different, some people go months with light or no symptoms. Others flare very often. If you do get a diagnosis, you will figure out with time what your normal is. So, your symptoms might get worse sometimes and improve other times. Symptoms are also dependent on how you treat your body. Rest, drinking lots, taking your medicine, and not overexerting yourself will make your symptoms better overall. 3. Sjogren's is the autoimmune disease that mainly affects the moisture producing glands. Technically, Sjogren's is systemic, which means it has full body effects. However, it is mainly associated with the moisture producing glands. There are other autoimmune diseases that deal with other organs that have similar symptoms such as Lupus. However, when you go to a specialist, if it is an autoimmune disease, they will be able to figure out which one it is. 4. Symptom changes throughout the day are normal. My eyes and mouth feel worse a night. Like I said before though, everyone's disease activity is different. Normal eyedrops don't work for most Sjogren's patients. I use prescription anti-inflammatory ones. 5. If you have diabetes, your blood glucose would be off the charts. Also you would be losing weight like crazy and would have to urinate frequently. So, I wouldn't pursue diabetes as a diagnosis. I hope you are able to get some answers and some relief. Good luck! "
10381,"First off, with that prescription always get high index lenses from here on out. It'll make the glasses thinner. 1. Hard to say if there's a reason. Sometimes people's eyes are just different. When it becomes that high of a prescription, lots of things can cause eyes to be different. It seems stable so not a big worry. 2. These are very high prescriptions! Easy for numbers to change but 0.50 dipoters (units) isn't a lot at those numbers. A lot comes down to where the doctor stops on the 1 or 2 game. A general rule of thumb though, is for each change of 0.25, someone sees roughly 1 line worse on the eye chart. Based on that, someone with a -4.00 prescription can't see the big E without glasses. So once you get to the -11 prescriptions, -0.50 isn't a big difference. 3. Prism corrects for double vision. There are only a handful of contacts that can do prism. If in the US (maybe other countries?) EyePrint is the the only one I can think of, however they are pricy. Other Scleral contacts may be a viable option, but if your husband does get double vision, he'd still need a pair of glasses with prism in them over the contacts. Other issues Cataracts - if you're lucky enough to live long enough, everyone gets cataracts. However the normal age related ones happen around 60-70 years old. Cataract surgery (usually, depending on implants) removes all ability to see up close without reading glasses. Usually surgeons don't rush for surgery unless vision is impaired. However with your husbands high RX, there can be other implants put in that help with vision and decrease prescription. However if vision is being impaired by cataracts, it'll still be hard to see. I'd need more information for that one. Glaucoma - good on him for the weight loss! Tbh though idk if weight truly affects eye pressure. That being said, if pressure was good in the past, I don't think it should be much different. Dry eyes - affect a ton of people in a wide range of severities. If the plugs work, great! If not there are a ton of options out there to try. Unfortunately there isn't one solution to dry eye that works for everyone, so you'll need to work with your optometrist if there's an ongoing issue. "
10382,Agreed. Who knows if i Wouldve gotten it around my 40-50's. Fact is that rhe vaccine for me was a fast train towards my diagnose and me battling the symptoms. What keeps me going is that my wife has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and brugada syndrome since young. We managed to connect on a deeper level sharing chronic pains and issues.. safe to say it bonded us more. 
10383,"What about the actual sphere? My left eye rx got .25 stronger, I've also been dealing with some headaches only on the left side of my head ? My eyes also just feel so much better when I'm not wearing glasses at all. "
10384,I'm 22 and my dream is to become a surgeon. I will probably need to undergo cataract in my both eyes in the near future. Can I still become a surgeon considering the fact I will have the cataract surgery ? 
10385,I am a tech at an eye clinic and this is one of the questions I ask at every exam with every person. I can tell you it is super common and a lot of people see them! I'm 29 and I've been seeing them since I was 18 in both eyes. Glaucoma takes time to develop so I'm sure they've checked your pressures at appointments just like they do every patient. I would suggest if you are really worried to ask the dr about supplements such as preservision or anything else they can name off. Wear sunglasses outside and keep up yearly checks. 
10386,"If you are now 40, the likelihood that your KC is going to progress much further is small and it is unlikely you will need a transplant. If your current lens fitter doesn't fit scleral lenses, it would be worthwhile finding someone who does. Most fitters use trial lenses and you will have a good idea of what sort of vision you will get from scleral lenses before they are ordered. "
10387,"I share this exact story on here all the time. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ As someone who has won the battle with Keratoconus, I like to answer all of our newly diagnosed people with this message :) -First of all, do not panic. KC does NOT mean the end of your eyesight or your world. You are now embarking on a journey, a KC journey. I was diagnosed in 1968 and 1970 when there was no such thing as CXL, Sclerals and transplant procedures were primitive. I had successful transplants (1980, 1982) and I am now in glasses 20/25 and 20/40.. My advice to you is: 1. Not panic 2. Find a doctor and lens fitter that you trust. It's YOUR eyesight. Get a 2nd opinion if you need it. 3. Follow his/her instructions 4. If you have ANY problems or concerns, contact them. Even when it is after clinic hours, there is always someone on call to help. Yes, you have support online, something I didn't have in my day; however, run everything you read online by your doctor before any treatment; even advice from me :) There are so many great treatments today. The chances of needing transplants are much slimmer than in my day. You should do fine. Most get relief by CXL and Scleral lenses. I hope this calms your fears a bit :) \*\*\*\*\*Update,\*\*\*\*\*\* July, 2021 Saw my doctor on the 26th.. 39 and 41-year-old grafts are still clear and healthy. He is going to put me into scleral lenses. I get fitted on 9-1 and I and hope to get 20/20 once again :( Cornea transplants are NOT supposed to last this long. I am an exception to the rule. Talk to your doctor :) It's going to be ok; really :) \*\*\*\*Update 9-1-21 Was fitted with Scleral lenses and now have 20/20 and 20/25. "
10388,Sunlight is 10-1000 times more intense. Your concerns have been artificially inflamed. 
10389,This is tricky. Normally my feeling is that someone of your age with your history should get frequent corneal topographies and wait for evidence of active progression before doing CXL. But your corneal thickness of 419 is close to the threshold of 400 where CXL gets trickier. I don't have any sense of how quickly you might lose 19 microns of thickness if you took the watchful waiting approach. But that is something I would discuss with my ophthalmologist. Good luck! 
10390,"Hello. I'm 19 yo, I have diabetes and PVD Ã®n both eyes. Floaters and all that stuff.

I have been to two or three ophtalomologists and IOP was fine, 19-20 with adjusted corneal thickness of 573, done with the airpuff test (if they used goldmann they could probably been a bit lower), optic nerve looks healthy on fundus exam, so there was no need for a OCT. No diabetic retinopathy or other complications due to diabetes on the fundus exam. Could this be related to my PVD instead? The floaters are quite alot, and I also have flashes in my central zone, but the visual acuity overall Ã®s going on stable. Should I go for a retinal Oct?

10391,"Hi everyone. I was diagnosed about 18 months ago with primary ss. I am 47 f. My rheumatologist put me on plaquenil 400 mg at the time. I noticed an increase in energy and less joint pain. Until approx two months ago. My joints are bothering me, especially my fingers, and I'm needing naps again. I've been working right through the pandemic so my routine hasn't changed. Has anyone else started plaquenil and then noticed it becoming less effective? And if so, what happened next for you? Thank you! "
10392,"60, but in the past I experienced this even with 30. "
10393,"Respectfully, I should mention to add some perspective that I have had epi off CXL on both eyes for mild KC at 20 yes old, and it was best decision I ever made. My vision was fine and now I have a secure future. I understand not everyone gets this, but many do benefit. Also your eyes are much more likely to progress without CXL, than with. Likelihood of KC progression is about 50-75% -without CXL- (give or take), whilst likelihood of complications from CXL is under 5 percent! Based on experience I would vouch for CXL, make sure to find the best affordable practitioner. "
10394,"Yeah I've heard that, I'm 23 and the KC seems to be in a very early stage so my outlook is generally pretty positive. Don't know why I'm so worried tbh, with such a high success rate of halting progression, then the halting of progression, in combination with my early detection, should in all likelihood prevent the need for a transplant for at least 7 years. "
10395,"VERY interesting. Mine seemed to be caused by a severe kidney infection, but I do remember in the months after, I was at the ER multiple times with red, swollen, painful itchy feet and they couldn't figure it out. I had forgotten about that since it was 20 years ago. "
10396,hello all! i'm highly interested in going into the field of optometry! my only concern is the debt i will get into. i heard an optometrist makes 80-90k as a new grad... so I don't know if I could get hundreds of thousands of debt paid off after optometry school. thanks for reading and please offer advice. 
10397,"Hello! My wife just turned 27. She has Myopia and a -13 prescription. She also has an astigmatism (I believe in her right eye). I am not sure if she is a -13 in both eyes. She said her glasses and contacts were the same prescription. She was a -12 two years ago, and said that her vision has continued to get worse. Everyone said it should have platued in her early to mid 20s, which hasn't been the case. We are at the point where no one in our area can help us. It took them 4 months to make her contacts and she can't wear them for more than 10 minutes without getting a headache. She is worried and I told her I'm gonna research and help her and we will look for a specialist. I am hoping someone here has any recommendations, or advice on how they, or someone they know, has handled situations similar to this one. "
10398,"I was in RGP's from 1968-1982. Transplants in 1980 and 82. Finally, my doctor has prescribed Sclerals :). "
10399,"You have nice thick corneas and only mild/moderate topographic changes. You should do very well with TG-PRK. Most patients do not require a second CXL treatment. PTK for epi removal is not my preferred method as epi thickness varies considerably in KCN eyes and this treats the eye as if it is like a regular cornea with uniform 50 micron tissue thickness in all areas. Thus, PTK in KCN eyes tends to remove some stromal tissue along with the epithelium. The exception to this is if you are outside the US and they are using transepithelial Streamlight technology. "
10400,"Finally got to do this once she got out of school. At 14"" away, she says that the dots are on the tip of my nose in a group. At the 10' mark, the grouping is still on the tip of my nose, though she thought it may have widened to the sides of my nostrils. Testing just her eye with the astigmatism, she indicated the dots became blurry. She still says they look identical in each eye as far as pattern, size, and quantity, but is not able to tell how many because of how small the dots are. Still present during both day and night. "
10401,"I was diagnosed at 18, I'm 59 now. KC is something you have to share your life with, but please don't let it define your life. I still laugh when people tell me ""I envy you for not having to wear glasses!""<U+009D> I'd give anything to be able to wear glasses again. You can do this! "
10402,I've never seen a PVD in a 21 yo without trauma. I'd suggest that you have the eyes dilated again.

I don't have any of the antibodies, just a super high ANA and loads of symptoms, particularly my nose. Dry as the deserts! My eyes get incredibly dry, and my mouth used to stick almost completely together in the AM. I was also on a drying medication and always equated it to that, but once we diagnosed me with Soeren's and I learned more, I realized I had likely been suffering for a long time with much milder symptoms. I became almost completely disabled and lost five years of my life: extreme dryness that was causing extreme sinusitis symptoms, extreme headaches, etc. I could barely move. 26 to 31, when I finally got diagnosed and put on a saliva stimulant that gave me my life back. I was incredibly depressed for so long, even after being on med""<U+0080><U+009D>lots of trauma from losing everything, my career, friends, even shite family support, etc. My rheum said something that really struck a chord with me, though. And I do not say this to be condescending AT ALL, believe me, I understand how it feels when you feel like you're not being heard and people are giving you dumb sht as remedy. But, he told me about two people in his practice who had the same autoimmune disease. He told me that one continued to try and live their life as normally as possible, with meds, tending to symptoms, etc. and the other became incredibly depressed. The one who kept at it was still working and doing pretty okay well into their older age. The one who became super depressed from the diagnosis ended up on disability and got cancer. I swear I am not saying this to scare you into being happy, or even giving some foo foo feel good story that's supposed to make you positive. My rheum isn't like that at all. He's cynical and great, but it shows the importance of attitude and perspective in the face of challenge. Everyone is different. Everyone experiences symptoms on a spectrum. Some people have zero symptoms but all the positive antibodies. Some people have no antibodies and all the symptoms. But it is important to deal with TODAY, and try not to stress what COULD BE. I truly hope none of that sounds condescending, but that story + treatment has radically changed the way I act and I swear it has worked wonders for me both physically and mentally. I am still working on it all the time. Sometimes I'm flaring and I'm a demon, but I try to remember what's going on and just take care of myself and decide I will choose to be as happy as possible, even though I have so much to be sad about sometimes. I also have a lot to be happy about, and now I choose to focus my energy there. I stayed sad for years and believe me, it did nothing but make me really sad and have lots of symptoms. Stress is also the number one WORST thing for autoimmune disease. I really find that nothing makes me flare worse than stress. And again, I am not trying to scare you into not being stressed. Life is stressful and sometimes we can't help it, but I do work really hard to keep my stress levels down. I kind of joke (mostly with myself) that anything stressful is like Kelso and Laurie (from That 70s Show, sorry if you don't know what that is but also I'd be surprised lol) and I have to be like Jackie when Hyde teaches her to act like she doesn't care what they do. So if something gets me stressed, sometimes I'll freak out a bit (it's my nature) but then I'm like, ""Whatever.""<U+009D> ""Thas cool.""<U+009D> Sorry if that's over your head lol, but it's just one of the things I do to make things less serious when everything feels like hell. [Actually here is the clip from That 70s Show lol](https://youtu.be/e6OdbvopoE8) Obviously there's no dancing around it. We do have to be realists in a sense. We could get worse as we age. We could end up disabled, etc. Unfortunately it's something that everyone should take into account, because anything can happen to anyone, but we have something that looks like a direct threat. Because of this, I have begun to plan for possible issues as I age, therefore am planning to work and save as much as possible once I can get back to work after this pandemic. It's made me get smarter with money, savings, and health. I used to think I could never have a family or a career like I'd always wanted, but now things are starting to lighten up a bit. I have a lot of my symptoms under control through medications and diet (AIP diet is great to go on if you're not in it yet) and working on stress, and I take everyday as it comes. I've started to plan a future again, after all the depression and getting things under control. It's still a struggle, and this pandemic shutting the world down hasn't helped. I'd only been diagnosed for four months when it hit, and I actually got covid and got severely ill. But, I'm still here! So are you, and when you're ready, it may be a good idea to talk to a therapist to see how best to handle your diagnosis. All I can say is. You have these things and it sucks so much. I'm sorry. Really. Life doesn't play fair, but you'll begin to find that so many people deal with invisible and visible health problems all the time and we find a way to get through. You will, too. But try not to think a train is coming and you're stuck on the tracks. As much as you could acquire some of these scary things, it's probably also just as likely that you may not. I hope you feel better soon. "
10404,"Thanks. I have very dry eye as well. I see a specialist next week. I found out I have cataracts (I'm 35) that are likely a result. The issues I'm dealing with the most (other than dry eye, which is freaking awful) are fatigue and paresthesia. I'm so exhausted and it's a really big problem. I was in the hospital for 2 months starting in February with Guillain Barre Syndrome with no known cause. They think that possibly in my case one autoimmune disease begets another, thus, lots of testing. "
10405,"There is more to a pair of glasses than 20/20 vision. If you're having strain issues (what you're describing), as opposed to blur issues, then just adjusting your prescription to have a far point a meter away may make your issue worse, rather than better. Trust the professional you saw, and if you can't do that, then seek a second opinion in person. "
10406,"Sorry for the Long post , im a hypochondriac and suffer from anxiety so im anxious about anything i plan to do . I'm a far sighted teen with left eye being -4.00 and right being -2.00 , im wearing eye glasses since i was 9 years old . My problem is that recently when i got my last pair my eyes start to act weird , they'd get strained easily , headaches dizzyness which concerned me alot . I then went to a specialist who did a thorough eye exam and told me that my prescription was higher than required he made me new glasses which cured my symptoms for few days but now im back to headaches and dizzyness i wanted to know if there is anything that can permanently end this all like a surgery which would make me able to see by my own eyes withtout the helps of lenses and get me relief my symptoms which are making me more anxious on daily basis. TL;DR :- Can a 18 year old farsighted teen with weird symptoms from wearing glasses (headaches , dizzyness) be cured by a surgery like lasik. "
10407,"Hi, I was 22 (28 now) when my health problems started. My worst health year I was 24 like you are now. I have several severe health problems surrounding my mouth and eyes (including Sjogren's), as well as asthma. I also have OCD and an anxiety disorder. I'm sorry things are so difficult for you right now and I hope something I offer helps. I've looked over some of your older posts on your symptoms to get a wider range of what your situation currently looks like. Life with chronic illness is hard and figuring out exactly what's going on and how to manage it takes a lot of time and energy and it's really frustrating. But once you get things diagnosed and treated things get more stable at minimum and then you just keep building off of that. Some of the advice I give here is specific to how things work in the US (where I live), I'm not sure where you're at, but I hope some of it is useful. I'm sure you already know that it's really important to take care of your mental health when you have physical health problems, as mental health issues can really exacerbate physical ones further. Anxiety especially can worsen dry mouth symptoms and is directly tied to triggering or worsening flares in autoimmune diseases. I know you've mentioned talking to family about your fears and the stress of living with dry mouth, but talking to a mental health professional who specializes in anxiety disorders and especially one who is familiar with chronic illness caused stress is really helpful. They can help build protocols you follow when you start to feel yourself going into an anxiety spiral. On top of that seeing a psychiatrist who can prescribe meds to help counter anxiety long term (meds you would take daily) or prescribe ""rescue"" meds (meds you take when you feel an anxiety attack or panic attack coming on) can really help boost quality of life. It can also help eliminate anxiety induced dry mouth symptoms and flare progression. Based on your previous posts, professional mental health care sounds absolutely vital for your wellbeing. As far as treating physical health problems go, I know long waits are awful and frustrating, but getting a professional diagnosis for what's going on is really important. This is especially true, since there are a lot of health problems that can cause dry mouth and eyes, including other autoimmune disorders. Having a professional diagnosis and treatment plan will provide you with access to treatments (beyond just cholinergic agonists (saliva stimulating meds)) that will keep your symptoms from worsening and give you ways to hopefully live a healthy mostly ""normal"" life. They'll also monitor your labs for signs of co-occurring conditions and signs that Sjogren's is affecting other parts of your body. I also really want to stress that building a network of doctors who you work well with is important. You don't deserve to have to work with doctors who are dismissive or useless. I've noticed you hadn't mentioned going to a dentist for dry mouth. Dentists are able to prescribe a range of treatment options (pilocarpine or evoxac as well as mouthwashes/toothpastes/sprays/etc. that are prescription grade that will help protect tissues in your mouth and your teeth from degradation). They can also address jaw issues (that can cause clicking, pain, difficulty chewing, etc.) I definitely second all the people saying that pilocarpine or evoxac are lifesavers, that's definitely been the case for me. It's also important to note that when you start a medication for dry mouth that it can take awhile (took 1.5 months for pilo, 1 month for evoxac for me) to kick in where it made a huge difference in my mouth. For sleep if you can tolerate it, they make chin straps for sleep apnea to hold your mouth closed which can delay the time it takes to dry out especially when using a gel, mouthwash or spray Also a humidifier right next to the head of your bed can make things a lot more tolerable Massaging the parotid salivary glands can help with pain and removal of plugs that are making your salivary glands less helpful as well. I know none of these are long term fixes, that will only come with the management of whatever's causing the problem, but these can ease things a bit. **Dry eyes:** Experiment with eye drops and gels (I personally love GenTeal Lubricant Eye Gel) until you find one that works (I know money can be tight, so seeing if your opthamologist has samples you can try or recommendations where to start or is willing to give you a prescription could allow a reduction in costs) Moisture Chamber Glasses-I've not actually tried these, but have seen them recommended by other's with Sjogren's Take lots of breaks from reading, using your computer/tablet/phone, etc. Close your eyes for a bit Light sensitivity-getting glasses that block blue light can be really helpful (esp. true if you get migraines or have issues with light sensitivity) (I have glasses from theraspecs (least expensive of the two mentioned, with lots of sales) and axonoptics (they make glasses that completely block unfiltered light from getting to your eyes that are great if fluorescents cause problems for you) I hope something here is helpful. I do really believe getting proper medical care is the best way to approach the symptoms you're experiencing. Being ill is hard and having your mental health managed well is vital. I really hope you seek professional assistance. Hope today is better! "
10408,No this didn't really start with me until 2013 And I'm going to turn 55 so I'm right in line with how this works with women it's just that they refuse to diagnose sjogren's but rather continually made sure they weren't giving me drug-induced lupus. My faith is so weak right now too it's like the worst part of it. 
10409,"Hi! The pain level varies, but mine was pretty painful afterwards. A burning, scratchy, sensation almost like when I first tried to wear RPGs. But multiplied by like 10. It didn't last long though, and the outcome was definitely worth every second! "
10410,"I'm a ten year dry eye veteran. I'd recommend you use preservative free eye drops like systane hydration pf. There are varying degrees of dry eyes so if you dry eyes are mild it can be easily managed with drinking plenty of water, taking fish oil... "
10411,"ello all, I have always worn contacts most of the time, and then some days just wear glasses or at night and in the mornings. prob went a couple years never wearing glasses at all, and when I finally did they would give me the worst headache. tried over a couple days but it was just too painful so I gave up. he next time I got a new prescription I told the doctor that I think something is wrong, I know the whole getting used to the new glasses thing but this is painful. nd I've worn glasses for the last 20 years a few times a week and never had an issue. o they suggested to use a different lens material so that it would not be so jarring. believe what they gave me are glass lenses. hese do not give me an instant headache but everything is warped making it hard to even walk (bumping into things tripping because I can't tell where the corners are) Am I just being dumb and this is all normal? ny advice appreciated. have to wear my glasses for the next week to 2 weeks full time and that's why I thought of reaching out now. "
10412,Yeah they are single vision. How likely is it that Essilor would make a mistake with the index I wonder. Unless the wrong order was placed but it definitely says 1.74 on the invoice. Also these are supposedly Sapphire coated. In the past my Nikons have always had a blue or green tinge to the reflections witj the AR coatings.. These ones don't have any kind of color. Is that the way the Sapphire coating is supposed to look? 
10413,"I was born bilateral congenital cataracts of the lamellar type. Found at 4, operated on the left at 5 right still has the cataract I'm now 25. Anyway I have Pepsi's of both eyelids mildly and moderate hyper mobility, very early balding and mild macrocephaly. Now all of that stuff is fairly common and happens totally isolated in most people however they ran me through neurology to be sure given the cataracts, the issue was no one EVER told my parents or me that cataracts can be linked to all these terrible genetic diseases etc. and looking online it's hard to find any real statistics for it, are the majority of congenital cataracts (bilateral) isolated and the people otherwise healthy or are the majority linked to another condition or is it 50/50? I'm just trying to get an idea. "
10414,"Yeah my eye doctor said the same that warm compresses/massages shouldn't have caused it. Since they said there's no tear or detachment I guess it might have been a natural occurance, I had these things since I was like 12. But never ever had them when looking at a computer screen, or as much as now. "
10415,"PSC make central vision blurry, and doesn't affect peripheral vision. Glaucoma classically does not affect central vision until end stages, typically after peripheral vision has been wiped out, which would be unlikely (not impossible) for someone in their mid-40s. Because your peripheral fields are clean, I would lean more towards a PSC causing your visual issues. I'd follow up with your third opinion, and see what they say. "
10416,I got CXL done in 2011 and since then I've been going every 12-18 months cause that's what my doctor told me. They said since I'm still young my kc can progress even though I've had cross linking done. Apparently after around the age of 40 you don't need to go as often. This is what I've been told at least. 
10417,"I am software engineer and had the same symptoms since I was 18. It was horrible and my study suffered. Mine went undiagnosed for years. I wish I had found the right doctor. Don't get discouraged. First try to find the root cause of it don't wait. Some conditions could be progressive but if you can identify on time and get a thorough diagnosis, you can manage it and live a good life. First try to find out if you have MGD. If there's any blockage you can save the glands on time. Find thick eye drops, something like systane hydrant pf for temp relief. Where are you based ? I have severe MGD, poor tear quality, and allergies. You need to get a thorough diagnosis, see what works best for you and definitely for mgd get it treated soon. "
10418,"Very sure. I will schedule an appointment tomorrow. In holding my glasses up, it seems like the optimal vision is achieved with them about an inch and a half off my face now. The whole thing is super odd... I've experienced a gradual degradation in my eyesight over the past 10 years (which I assume is normal), but this change was so drastic that it's caught me completely off-guard, especially given it's an improvement. "
10419,"Thanks for commenting, a lot of people claim they have had more after using them and admittedly i probably used too much. One type in particular was very stinging which i stopped using pretty soon. I had only 1 floater before using them and now i have 10 or so. "
10420,"Im a 26 M. So last week i was referred to an ophthalmologist as i was experiencing a zig zag blurriness in my vision for about 20min. He said that it was probably a migraine with aura but he said that he also found moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy. He told me to sort my bp with my cardiologist and that there was no need to see him again. Since then i have brought my blood pressure down with medication, however in the last week i have been experiencing new visual disturbances that are concerning me. This includes: increased floaters, dark spots when blinking on occasions, seeing a static rain when its not raining, afterimages, ectopic blue field when looking at bright walls and waking up to a cluster of black dots that disappear after a few seconds Are these typical symptoms of hypertensive retinopathy? I have a lot of anxiety surrounding the diagnosis and have been hypervigilant to my vision. I just find it weird that a day after the diagnosis all of these symptoms have slowly started. "
10421,In the prescription it says right eye sphere +0.25 left eye sphere +0.25 and interpupillary distance 64. I'm 22 years old and an ophthalmologist gave me the prescription. He said my vision is fine but 0.25 with pc protection will be better for staying in front of the monitor for many hours or something like this. I can see very good with the glasses on at close distance but it's blurry far away as you said. 
10422,"I was diagnosed with a cataract in my right eye during my junior year in high school. I believe I was 17 at the time. I'm not sure the cause, however the doctor claimed the fact I was using a nasal steroid spray to treat my allergies, could've been the case. I was also hit in the eye prior to getting cataracts while playing basketball. Needless to the say, there are quite a few speculations as to why this happened to me, but nothing certain. The vision in my right eye was corrected for distance, so post op I didn't need glasses for distance. I needed reading glasses, but glasses were not an everyday requirement for me. I got the surgery when I turned 18.., im 23 now and have experienced my vision deteriorate over the years. Having 20/20 in my left eye helps a lot, and because of this I've stayed away from glasses (reading & distance) for a long time until this year when I noticed my vision is just getting worse and worse each year. Not only have I had multiple prescription changes, but my current distance prescription isn't effective outdoors as it is indoors. I don't know if I'm the only person with this problem, but when I'm inside the glasses (distance) work perfectly fine. When I take them outside, it only works for a certain distance, but anything 150+ feet away becomes somewhat blurry. Is this normal? For those who have gotten a cataract surgery and it's been a minimum of 3 years, have you experience your vision worsen? "
10423,"Hello, I have gotten blepharitis twice in my life. Once about 3 years ago and I have it now. Wow, I forgot how miserable it can be. My heart goes out to all of you. Thank goodness, right now, it is on the mend. I have come up with a good remedy for it that has cleared mine up in about a week or less. I didn't realize how important it was to rest, as well. I am adding that to my regime. Here is my remedy: SCRUB: I use Grandpa's Pine tar shampoo, a squirt on a warm wet washcloth and gently scrub your tightly closed eye, anywhere there are crusts, gently scrub those off. Rinse and pat dry. DISINFECT: Next, I dab area with a cotton ball saturated with 10 or 12ppm colloidal silver and let air dry. (optional) Soothing Balm: I make a mixture of half and half virgin coconut oil (melted), and the best manuka honey you can find. I mix them together until they come together to make a balm. I make just a little bit at a time. If they are not emulsifying, just let the coconut oil cool down a bit. I keep this in a small airtight container and I only touch it with extremely clean fingers. At night, I put a generous amount on any part of my eyelids that are affected. It's fine if some gets in the eye. (For another eye issue, I actually made manuka honey eye drops with distilled water and it was amazing) During the day, I put a smaller amount on my eyes. I have heard people had luck with tea tree oil, maybe you could add a few drops to this balm. Last night I had trouble sleeping and I just got up and did this process a couple of times. It started feeling much better. If you can do this several times per day, this is good. I have also been eating foods high in sulfur and potassium. I also read that parsley juice is very good and I will try that today. Good luck to all of you and I wish you healing. "
10424,"They're lovely frames, if you go for them make sure they polish the lens edge as it makes a world of difference to the appearance.

10426,"What are the chances this actually happens and I'm not just jumping to conclusions? Recent job postings from the University of Detroit Mercy have been seen online showing they're looking to hire ODs to fill development and leadership positions in what appears to be the first steps towards opening a brand new optometry program. A Detroit area news search shows that University of Detroit Mercy recently purchased land and buildings in Novi, MI, saying that they're ""opening<U+00A0>a campus in Novi that will include<U+00A0>graduate and health education programs and<U+00A0>new continuing educational offerings in health care and related fields including dental. "" There's not mention of optometry but I couldn't help but wonder once I saw the job postings... The school's official statement on the purchase of the land and office buildings was pretty ambiguous: ""UDM President Antoine M.

""**Detroit Mercy's acquisition of this new campus will allow the university to expand academic programs in the health professions and other fields in which we are strong and that are in demand,"" he said**. "" What are the chances this actually happens and I'm not just jumping to conclusions? Anyway, what I really want to discuss is: Is there really a ""need"" for more optometry schools right now? What happens if another school opens up and starts pumping out an extra 50 -80 graduates every year?

I was shocked and said that was surprising because my dr said that if it happens it takes years. He said if not related to the hydroxychloroquine it could be very early macular degeneration. He didn't explain the changes clearly, indicate what it meant or how serious it was, and it was a pretty awful experience. He showed me the image without returning my glasses and only said ""this here. There should be one""<U+009D> like I knew how a macula was supposed to look. I guess if I could describe it there was a little horseshoe-ish shape in each eye that was a tiny bit faintly darker than the rest of the macula?

When I tried to get him to clarify what macular degeneration would mean he said ""you'll be legally blind in 15 years if that's what it is""<U+009D> terrifying!

10429,"So 7/7 I was on vacation and started seeing rainbows around lights. I called the closest eye place that would see me that day and I was diagnosed with uvitis ( for second time in my life). He said to do the steroid and dialating eye drops 3xs a day. On 7/12, I went back to the same company but in my hometown. He had me drop down to two drops a day for 3 days and then switch to one drop a day (7/15). 7/19, went back and said I was in the all clear and to stop the drops, so I did. He said to make sure I pay attention to my eyes and to resume the drops and make an appointment if it starts back up in a few days. 7/21 My eye starts aching really bad and I'm photosensitive. I put eye drops in and make an appointment. 8/2 I start with a different doctor at the same place. He keeps me at 3 drops. He then makes a 4.5 week plan on tapering down on the drops and says to come in every Monday for the best 5 weeks. I tell him I'm running low on drops, he says ""Call if you need more before next Monday or I'll write you one on Monday."" 8/8 I called today because I'm running dangerously low and I figured I could pick the drops up before I go to the optometrist tomorrow and im really busy tomorrow afternoon. The front desk lady said he can call me back in about 15mins. 2 hours go by and my phone rings. It's now a different optometrist. He tells me that this has been going on for awhile and that tomorrow will be my last appointment with them and that I need to transfer to a specialist. I asked about the script refill and he said that I'll have to talk about that tomorrow? But it seemed like the answer was no. I'm not sure what's going on, last week the doctor said that I tapered off way too quickly and he said he's not surprised it came back. He told me how over the next 4.5 weeks how we were going to taper it down and he seemed confident that this was upset control since he said there weren't that many cells floating around. Now this week they're saying that this is taking too long and that I have to go to a specialist. I feel like they just wasted a week of my time. If they had felt my case wasn't treatable then why did they have me make another appointment? What's going on here? Is this normal? I'm so confused. "

10434,"Would the restoration involve implants or dentures? I had all my top teeth pulled last year and got dentures. Currently saving up for the bottom teeth. Five years ago, I had no dental problems at all. After four years of dry mouth and low calcium levels, almost every tooth was loose. The extractions were no problem at all, mostly because I'd been dealing with tooth pain and gum irritation for months leading up to the procedure. I had 10 pulled at once and had no issues. I was eating fairly normally the next day (pasta, rice, potatoes, etc.) for someone who didn't have half their teeth. I didn't have any major pain or anything like that. "
10435,"1. Tough question. I can only answer for myself as an independent contractor. 1-2 yrs out I made 130k with a lot of commute working 6 days a week. Left some clinics, found better production clinics instead of per-diem. Now I make 200k after three years, less commute and 5 days a week. 2. Lolz, no. Lots of opportunity. Lost two days in a clinic. Filled it in 2 hrs with three phone calls (in NE tho). 3. ""Rural"" corporate is a gold mine. 4. Fuck yeah, Im rich bitch! 5. Dont try to. In my opinion private practice is unfortunately a dying breed. We are turning into pharmacy. I do medical optometry in corporate with no problems. Corporate is always deemed as evil. Its the dont give a shit lame docs that give it a bad rep. I have never once been told how to practice in three years of corporate. At the private practices ive contractor for, usually get told what to do once a week. I only practice standard of care, have legit been told by two private practices to dilate less... 6. Hell yea. Lumps and bumps and lasers baby. Service fees are gonna skyrocket! 7. All garbage. All decrease a doctors motivation to give good care. They can all go to hell. 8. Facing good optometrists? Re-writing the mistakes of decades of shit ODs. Half of my day is explaining missed conditions or educating on all the things a dilated eye exam can reveal. 9. More bullshit than now... 10. Not to worry. A lot of work available. Best piece of advice, dont sign a contract at a place you've never worked. Ask to work independently first. If they refuse, fuck em. "
10436,Definitely looking for contact lenses. Do you happen to know of brands that carry them? And no existing conditions currently. I am only 26 so hopefully not for awhile. 
10437,"Hello there. I'm a TV screenwriter who landed my first very big job. Sadly I had the Athen protocol done on my both eyes (I'm 38, what an idea, right?). Yet I was operated apparently by a reputable surgeon. I wasn't told about the recovery though, or maybe I dismissed it as a one in a thousand very unlikely ""complication"" type of thing. My journey has been quite difficult to be honest. It took me about 5 days to be able to see properly on my phone, at 8 only I could see properly the letters. I'm now at 5 weeks and still EXTREMELY sensitive to light (I'm in CA and it's honestly unlivable). Keeping my eyes open is not easy, they tire a lot, hurts, and ""sort of begging for tears and darkness"" so I want to close them. There is still residual pain in the left one (which was my good eye before surgery). Overall my vision still has ghosting, by that I mean the letter on the screen blur, they feel fuzzy unless I focus very hard on them, which is not sustainable, but then I can have clear view for just a fraction of a sec. Overall my vision is way worse than before the surgery, so I'm panicked, sad and feeling about to slip into a serious depression. I'm trying to reason with my own sanity. If I look up or ahead in front of me it's harder than if I look down. It's also much blurrier. If I blink my eyes then the letters feels readable on my laptop again but that's just for another fraction of a second. Overall this whole ordeal has been a disaster. Reading more than one page from printed book is just impossible, my eyes tire too much and still it's kinda fuzzy. I'm unable to write, to re-read myself, or to fully work, can't really watch a show without getting tired, or to do anything actually. I'm worried I'm loosing my mind with this since I have now this constant headache due to poor vision + the photosensitive side of it which is really tough. I sees halos everywhere too, even inside with my desk lamp. So here are my 4 questions. 1) Anyone went through this as well at 5 weeks post surgery? Is there still hope for me to get better? They are saying it takes 3 months for most people to be better, and sometimes 6 months even. Is that actually something to look forward? I feel that by now I should be able to function and I'm far from it. From what I've been told my cornea was thick and strong and my KC was not very advanced yet. 2) Will my sight still improve after 5 weeks? Please someone tell me I'm just being impatient. I was 20/20 on both eyes before surgery so this is really disturbing to me. 3) Will I be ever able to work all day on a screen like before? Or to spend a whole evening reading a book.... I never asked for much in my life but for this two simple pleasures. This is all I had. 4) And lastly will the photosensitivy eventually wear off? But mostly, did anyone went through this as well and ended happy at the end.... ????? Sorry for my questions. I'm truly lost. "
10438,"I'm 25. My doctor said for my right eye, CXL isn't an option. We are past that point. For my left eye, it is, if needed. "
10439,"I'm a 24 nearly 25 year old male. I've always had good vision and never any issues. In fact, maybe a little over a year ago my last vision test results were 20/13. Lately my eyes have just been hurting from the TV when I play. Is there anything I can do to combat this? I have an overhead light on when I play games. I got a blue light screen protector for my laptop since I've been having to do a lot of online class work and I play games on there as well and I've noticed my eyes don't hurt when I play on my laptop vs when I play Xbox. The games that hurt my eyes aren't even anything like flashy like Call of Duty. The one that's been hurting my eyes lately is NBA 2k21. Would it be worth it to get a pair of blue light glasses? "
10440,"Let me clarify the point I was making. There are many critical periods for different levels of visual development, and they are hardly set in stone. Generally, binocularity which is critical to visual acuity development occurs within the time period I specified, with some sources citing an even shorter time frame. I am aware that deprivation amblyopia often occurs earlier, and did not mean that all visual development occurs within the time frame I specified to the exclusion of any risk outside of that frame. I am also aware that true risk of deprivation amblyopia does not entirely disappear theoretically, and may in extreme and rare cases cause amblyopia beyond what are most widely accepted as the major critical periods for various levels of visual development. Conclusions about the risk of amblyopia in later years due to deprivation come mostly from animal studies, and while not to be dismissed, do not necessarily create an accurate picture of the true risk of amblyopia development in school-age children and adults beyond the presence of early life amblyogenic factors. In the vast majority of amblyopia cases, there was an amblyogenic factor present at a very young age, which inhibited either binocularity, or retinal visual signal. You are no doubt familiar with these factors, and must also be aware that for a visual-normal child to develop amblyopia beyond the time period in which those amblyogenic factors are most commonly present is so unlikely as to not be of practical concern, and certainly not from an inconsistent non-deprivational cause such as fluctuating accommodation. Your mention of accommodative esotropia falls under the umbrella of early amblyogenic factors which contribute to amblyopia development, as these patients almost invariably exhibit high levels of hyperopia at a young age. In the case of uncorrected hyperopia in the absence of esotropia, as long as binocularity is maintained, the worse that patient will likely experience are simply the common sequelae of binocular vision dysfunction: eye strain, headaches, intermittent blurry/double vision etc. So to reiterate: A visually normal patient who can control their accommodation periodically through the day (which includes everyone, if they are aware that we all have this voluntary ability despite what OP may believe) carries almost no risk of developing amblyopia whatsoever. This is not to say that it is impossible to develop amblyopia at 7 or 8 years old, but that risk is more of a theoretical possibility than a practical clinical concern, and certainly not in this case. Edit: Another point I'd like to add is that amblyopia has been proven to be treatable beyond the previously accepted barrier of 7-10 years old despite decreased neuroplasticity, and I'd be happy to provide a source if you are interested. I'm not sure you were trying to argue against that point so it may not be necessary. "
10441,"If I were you, if you don't like the clarity with 1.67, I'd look into Trivex. I use Trivex on about 90% of my patients. It's the lightest weight material available and the clarity is great - there's no stress inside the lens like there is in other materials. I don't know that any online vendors would offer Trivex but it's absolutely worth looking into. Avoid Poly if you don't like aberration. "

At this point, there is no pain after I have them; it's just hard to see until the colored circle expands widely enough for me to see through it. I've always had weather/pressure related headaches, and my doc gave me Maxalt a number of years ago to help because she suspected there might be migraines happening too. Maxalt helped, but then headaches got worse were, and really bad in the morning when I woke up. She had me do a sleep study, and it turns out I have really bad apnea (doc said not weight related, recognizing I'm a tubby dude).

Could my ""normal"" migraines evolve to these? I happen to have a regular eye exam scheduled on the 17th and will bring this up with my eye doctor.

10444,"So, ever since about Christmas or so, I've had what I think is double vision. I think it might also be called ""ghosting""? At first, I thought it was just blurry vision. It's most noticeable against shiny objects or where there's noticeable contrast, like black text on a white background. Everything is sort of shifted, sometimes downwards, sometimes to the side. It's not usually a complete copy of the image, moreso like an overlapping? Seems to happen in both eyes, and I haven't really noticed it happening more during one point of the day over others. I don't really have dry eyes, though I am on Claritin daily for allergies. I used to wear contacts daily but haven't really worn them that much over the past couple weeks. I saw an optometrist back in the beginning of January. He said my eyes worsened a bit (-1.5 and -1.00 I think) and that I have a very slight astigmastism, but not enough that would be causing the double vision- does this sound right? He couldn't find a reason for the vision problems. I'm not exactly sure which tests he did? (It was at an America's Best, so I'm sure it was the basic tests plus the one for I think glaucoma that you pay extra for...). He sent me to a PCP who ordered an MRI to rule out MS- thankfully, the MRI was negative. My basic lab work also came back normal except for mildly elevated fasting glucose (thanks PCOS). The PCP wants me to see a neurologist anyway since I have a slight hand tremor (that I've had for like 10+ years). My appt is tomorrow morning, so I want to be able to describe my symptoms as accurately as possible. I'm assuming she's just going to refer me to a neuro-ophthalmologist anyway. My new glasses don't really help with the double vision, just the blurriness. I've used glasses for a long time now, so wouldn't they have noticed any significant astigmatism before now? Since the MRI was negative, it makes me feel like it's some sort of physical defect vs a neurological problem, but I would think the optometrist would've been able to see something? "
10445,A ballpark simple magnifier can be calculated by the power of the lens divided by 4. Plus 1. For 1.5x you'd need a +7.00 (or try +6) which can be purchased pretty cheaply on Amazon. You have no control of the focal point and it would be 17 cm in front of your face. The only way to magnify AND control the distance is to use Loupes. 
10446,"Hello Everyone, I know there are two military Optometrists that frequent the board on here u/chris_bryant and u/falbtron. I'm 23 years old and have been having some weird things going on with my eyes since december that it seems like nobody can figure out. I lost 100lbs to enlist in the Army and I need to know if this will affect me. 1. (December-Janurary timeframe) Went to pearle vision after noticing my left eye was red and a little achy (no sharp or boring pain) they noted I had simple episcleritis. It did not go away in two weeks. 2. Went to new (current) eye doctor, he looked at my eyes and said it was Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and I had blepharitis. I've gone back to them a few times because of the red eye manifesting randomly in both eyes. Also the opthamalogist concurred with the same diagnosis as my opthomatrist. I also had a random bump form in my left eye, was told its phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis. It formed on my conjunctiva. Got steroid drops and it went away never to return. They gave me ocusoft wipes and also zerviate (liquid zyrtec) eye drops for allergies. Sometimes my eyes itch, the zerviate clears it up and sometimes flonase, zyrtec, claritin clear up any itching. Sometimes it gets red for only a few minutes and goes away, sometimes it lasts for a few days. Last month my eyes were clear but as of the last few days my eyes were red, just randomly. 3. Went to Opthaologist at different office who did my father's eye surgery for implants. He noted unspecified episcleritis, and wanted me to get a blood test done to rule out to make sure that I do not have any issues. He noted very minor blepharitis as well but he said everyone has blepharitis and some people have it where it flares. 4. Went to a new optometrist and he noted my eyes were ""picture perfect"" and said I should start with the basics, just dry eyes and most likely it's not what any of my eye docs mentioned. He worked at Camp Pendlton and said I would have no issues at all. Even with blepharitis, it's an easy fix. I went back today to get my eyes looked at because they are getting red. Doctor noted I had allergies and these little allergic bumps on my lower eyelid, he wants me to get the blood test as well so we can rule out systematic conditions causing this. The DoD states ""Current Symptomatic blepharitis is Disqualifying"" They also state ""Chronic or Acute Conjunctivitis but not Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis"" Eye doctor #2 said that's what I had, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis that could be causing blepharitis. But other docs are saying episcleritis. Can I enlist as an infantryman with this? It seems like taking care of it is easy and no different than someone who takes an allergy pill? I just need some guidance from anyone that's a military Optometrist or someone with the issue in a familiar setting. Thanks for taking the time everyone to read my post! "

10451,"Hello everyone. I'm a 30 year old male who's worn contacts for 10+ years. I'll admit, I'm not the best at removing them when I go to sleep, so I bought a pair of glasses to wear at night. I just got them, and tried them on for the first time, but I simply can't wear them. My prescription is fairly strong. My optometrist prescribed -6.5 for my contacts, but -7.5 for my glasses. I do have a slight stigmatism in each eye. When I put my glasses on, I had to take them off after 20 seconds of wear. I was left excruciatingly dizzy, the kind of dizzy where it's almost like having a blood sugar attack. I was sweating, dizzy, and had a headache. It's been a good 10 minutes since I've had them on, and I'm still dizzy. When I use my contacts, though, nothing of the sort. Is there a reason I'm feeling this way? Are the glasses too strong? I can't imagine wearing these for a few days, and considering they were sent off for a week to construct the lenses (not to mention, the price), is there anything I can do to mitigate the headaches? Or should I just stick with the contacts? "
10452,"Hi, I went to an eye test the other day and the optician commented on the pigment behind my eyes as they always do. I've known about it since I was about 13 and had it checked out by an ophthalmologist who said I was born with it. My Mum has the same and has had it checked out twice. We both have blue eyes and were told it's common. What's made me a bit concerned is he said he can see it round nearly all the back of my eyes. It was hard to see as its really at the edge of them so they have to angle and have me look far over to see it, its never picked up on the retina photographs. My last optician who commented on it said it was like scattered dots along the bottom of the back of my eye. This one said yes I can see those but I can angle further back than that and see beyond that and what's there is like how a dry dessert looks cracked and its blues and browns. He explained to come back in a year more out of his fascination then him being concerned he said as he hadn't seen it before. I left feeling a bit puzzled as it hasnt been described that way to me before. He did say he was probably able to get a better angle than the previous opticians had. I went down the Google rabbit hole and am really worried about Retinitis Pigmentosa now because those pictures look about how he described it however mine cannot be picked up on the Oct scan because they're further out. I'm not sure if any of this is making sense, this optician was quite young so I'm not sure if it was just new to him. I remember when I originally saw the ophthalmologist they said there was no need for them to have referred me for this so I'm now worried it's become more apparent or something because they previously told me it was nothing. I have a slight astigmatism in both eyes so I do get some starbursting on led lights and I've had mild visual snow since I was younger, which I read can be a sign of retinitis pigmentosa so I'm freaking out a bit now. I'd really appreciate some advice on this if anyone has any. Thank you. "
10453,"Hi all! I'm 20f with no previous eye problems. About a year ago I noticed the vision in my left eye was blurry and wavy. There were also floaters and black spots I hadn't noticed before. I went to a retina specialist who said I have a epiretinal membrane. Since then, I had blood work and urinalysis done without any significant results. I was put on fluconazole in case it was yeast related, and then prednisone for a few months. Neither improved my eye. I'm currently taking prednisolone eye drops and have been for a couple months. My retina specialist has no idea what caused this as it isn't common in someone my age. He doesn't want to do surgery yet either because it may resolve itself. Any treatment ideas? Please? I have another appointment coming up this week. "
10454,"I can get to 12-14 but I start noticing some difference around 10. My doctor actually just told me yesterday to change the saline halfway through the day if I'm doing some sort of ""different""<U+009D> activity such as taekwondo class. She says 8 hrs per day is her gold standard for my Zen Lens tho, so I guess I'm doing good. "
10455,"I'm not perfect yet, and still have another two months on the meds my doctor put me on, but I'm much better than I was. I'm in the same boat as you, 23 years old and been having issues since August/September 2020. Before my treatment I was regularly missing work because my eyes burned so badly I couldn't use a computer screen. I can work with minimal discomfort now and that in itself is huge for me. Instead of being terrible with a few sporadic okay days, I have near-normal days with sporadic worse days. Note that to get here I did have to pay out of pocket (insurance in the US is absolutely useless) for LipiView for the doc to check out my glands, and LipiFlow to get em cleared out before going on treatment. It was about $175 and $1800 respectively for those but so far no regrets. I've seen debate online over how effective exercise is with helping this condition... some pseudoscience here and there about getting your blood pumping being better for tear and oil gland flow, but I don't know if exercise helps concretely. The primary benefit of exercise for me was/is helping take my mind off my eyes when I'm feeling discomfort and helping put me in a better mood for the day so I'm not a depressed piece of shit over my eyes. "
10456,"First of all, get an Ophthalmologist not an ""eye doctor"". You can find somebody near you on the internet. If they can do IPL, lipiflow, RF... then they are probably much better to work with dry eye. Also ""Dry eye, Blepharitis, MGD, Corneal neurologia"" and ""Dry eye Syndrome support community"" are good facebook groups where people can advise you to find a dry eye doc near you. And ask if people have simmilar problems with drops. I only remember reading something about throat cancer with cyclosporine drops, that's the main reason I got my lower plugs. And sore throat could definetively be something caused by these drops. And don't think dry eye care is any better in EU. It's even worse here. With ""free healthcare"" people don't even think to do anything more than a doctor tells them, and this doctor stopped learning when he/she got out of school 30 years ago so they don't even know cyclosporine is a thing. Good luck. "
10457,"Hi there, I was recently told by my optometrist to use reading glasses, which have been helping me quite a bit, although there are days where I can't carry reading glasses with me to put them on when I need to see well up close, so I'm wondering if it would be fine to get progressives with my prescription on the bottom and the rest as clear glass. I spoke to someone yesterday who said they tried that and it made them feel nauseas, but perhaps this doesn't happen often. Thoughts? EDIT: My reading prescription is very light, +.75 on the left and +.5 on the right. "
10458,Floaters have been in my vision since I was 14. Some dissipate but new ones form. I tune em out for the most part.

10460,"There's a lot to know about the eye and with each part, there comes so many different diseases and disorders that can occur. Take glaucoma for example. There's not just one kind of glaucoma, but probably at least 20! Knowing all the most recent studies, best treatment options, surgeries, and even picking up on those subtle types is hard to keep in your mind all at once. Especially when there are other parts of the eye you have to know too. The retina can have so many different disorders going on with it that it is good to have someone who subspecializes in it. If you had a retinal detachment, a cornea specialist could try to do the repair for it, but they probably haven't done one in a long time (perhaps since residency) and likely would prefer someone who works with it more frequently to handle it. The surgeries for each part of the eye are so small and technical that sub speciality is incredibly important! "
10461,"I started having monocular diplopia on bright colored stuff (mostly yellow and white) with a dark background when I was 12 years old, but it has worsened over the years. I went to an ophthalmologist at age 12, and was told I had a few floaters, but no eye problems. I didn't experience blurry vision until I was early to mid 20's when I got eyeglasses and contacts at the time. One eye was -1.25, the other was -.75 at the time I first received glasses. As the years have passed, my monocular diplopia has worsened to the point that it's very annoying, almost unbearable. When I get a new prescription / new glasses it seems to reduce it tremendously, but will soon worsen, and my vision starts getting blurry quickly after fitting myself with new glasses (I'd say within 3 months). Recently, I've noticed my close up vision has worsened as well. I can only see things clearly without my glasses at probably 5 - 8 inches in front of my face. Anything closer than that, or anything further than that, it's blurry. Over the last 2 months, I've visited two separate ophthalmologist, and one optometrist. One of the ophthalmologist was a highly recognized corneal specialist in the state I live in, with many many years of experience. All of them have stated my eyes are perfectly healthy, with no pathology going on in my eyes. I can't see up close to use the computer with or without current prescription, , so I use the first pair of glasses that I had ever received (the one with the -1.25 in one eye, -0.75 in the other). I told the last ophthalmologist which I went to that I believe I needed two pair of glasses, one with a weaker prescription to do computer work and such. He stated that me being 34, I should be able to see up close with my distant vision glasses, and suggested that I try to work through and try to use the computer with them for about a month. He stated I shouldn't have any problems seeing things close up until around age 50, said he didn't see anything going on with my eyes that would explain that. I've been using my old glasses, the first pair I ever had, to work on the computer for years now. I was wondering if anyone experienced in optometry knows if wearing distant vision glasses for a month when doing close up work as well as distant vision, would cause my close up vision to improve?

10463,"Heya, I am male(31). I was diagnosed with Sjogren's about 8 months ago. I've been currently having some odd symptoms that have been pretty annoying. I have chronic pain in feet, knees chest, and wrists. I get burning pain in the knees and elbows. I have random pain in the ears and throat. I also have muscle weakness in legs when going up/down stairs and my arms tend to shake when I hold something for longer than 10+ minutes. I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and recently found out I have BFS (benign fasciculation syndrome). My knee/wrist pain and the shaking in my arms/legs are being blamed on the depression which feels like the doctors are using depression as a scapegoat. Any ideas or suggestions on what I should ask to get done for this? Thank you! "
10464,"Same scenario for me. I had a scar form on my left eye after CXL (in 2010) which causes ""fogging"" in my vision at night. My doctor recommended getting the topology scan every 4 months to monitor as the possible decline of vision in that period would be small compared to the risk of a scar in my good eye. So far the right eye has not changed in 11 years. We reduced the frequency of scans over time, and now I go every 12 months. I'm 33 so the risk of progression after this age is small. One factor to consider is how quickly did your bad eye progress? For me it was so slow I never even noticed a change - I only saw the optometrist who diagnosed me because my glasses broke! Even a 6 month gap between scans would not cause a noticeable change to my subjective vision. "
10465,"I think despite all those informations, it's still hard to analyse without more medical background. Keratokonus usually stop progressing after older age (32 in my case, not sure about when stops), and the doctor is being conservative about doing medical interventions (they have big risks - I've read at least one user here who catastrophically failed their crosslink and ruined his vision, needing a transplant, and people complaining how vision got worse afte it. Those are minority, sure). I also had one similar problem with my doctor - the opposite of yours. After my sight got a bit worse, he wanted to do ferrara ring surgery, trying to get me a schedule and discussing values. I almost cried after leaving that day. After hearing a second opinion, I was shocked when the medic tell me I did not needed surgery and my topography was exactly the same of 4 years before, ie, keratokonus did not progressed. I just needed new a new glasses subscription - and I got that and that fixed everything. Don't hear the other users who tell your doctor is bad. There is not enough data to know. Try to gather all of your medical info and go for a second opinion - preferable someone who cares and will not try to sell you a medical service like a merchant trying to sell old stock. If you still indecise, got a third. Then decide. Good luck. "
10466,"I'm 31. I'm near sighted, so my glasses don't help me see near objects. They help me see things farther away from me. And a quick google of prismatic effect shows that it's for double vision. Not refraction issues which is what myopia is. So can you please expand on this to clarify what you mean. "
10467,"1. You won't notice a difference in the thickness or appearance of lenses between plastic and trivex. Trivex is lighter weight and my go-to material for my patients. It's harder, lighter, more scratch resistant and offers excellent optical properties. 2. Which multi focal lens did your doc put you in? I might have missed that part, sorry! 3. Given your script and the need for a +2.00 add I think you'd benefit from a pair of progressives. While they do require a decent sized lens (tall - also known as the 'B' measurement) but a 33 B wouldn't be bad. Bigger frames tend to be more beneficial as you get more out of the script, but that said, they don't need to be huge! If you work on a computer all day you might also look into glasses primarily for the computer. Most progressive wearers find that intermediate (computer) zone narrow and don't love it for 8+hrs per day. PLEASE, for the love of God, do NOT order a progressive online! That's a waste of money and you are asking for trouble. If you're going to invest in a pair of progressives, see a real optician who knows what the hell they're doing :). "
10468,"I had been wearing RGPs for over 10 years and my KC had gotten worse so the optometrist suggesting scleral in that eye (left). It's a game changer on all levels, comfort, wear time. The only negative is being able to put them in and take them out. For me, it took over a week before I mastered putting them in, taking out was easier for me. Once you figure it out, you'll never go back to RGP. After wearing for over a year, I went back for one in my right eye. Fitting can be complicated and takes a few times before you get the fit and prescription that works. Just be patient, it's well worth the wait! Good luck. "
10469,"Other things become more important, like deposit resistance, ability to stay hydrated, effects of cleaning, etc. I thought that could be the case, they do have different water %, 48 vs 36%. What worries me though is that I've read on a medical journal ([PDF link](http://assets.markallengroup.com/article-images/image-library/147/uploads/importedimages/overnight. pdf)) that for overnight wear to have no impact on corneal metabolism the minimum Dk/t should between 87 and 125, for the *average* cornea. Which means some corneas may have higher requirements. And considering the Dk/t rating is usually for the center region of a -3.00D lens, it makes me think the B&L lens is too close to that minimum... But I guess that for most people occasional overnight wear should be OK. "
10470,"You get used to doing compresses and eye drops after a while. I've had to do compresses because of chalazions for like 15 years now. While I don't really achieve the 3-4 times a day my doctor wants, I can usually manage at least one and often I can get 2 or 3 in. Get yourself one of these: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N303YPU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title? ie=UTF8&psc=1. It stays warm for way longer than a damp washcloth and the headband makes it easy to just put it on and zone out for a while. I often put on a podcast or something to listen to, or meditate. If you want something that stays warm even longer, get a new sock, cut off the bottom four or so inches, put about 3/4 cup of rice in it, and tie it off with a zip tie. Depending on how much you stuff it and how long you microwave it, you can get like 20 minutes of good heat out of it. As for Doxy, I talked to my doctor about it, but I pushed back. I try to limit antibiotics in general, but that one has some warning about sun exposure and that just doesn't jive with my lifestyle (the first time a doctor made me do a round of it was when I was living in Hawaii and I was buuuuuuummmed). I'm doing pretty well on TheraTears; I did a round of [this regimen](https://www.lookingglassoptical.com/patient-instructions/instructions-for-therapeutic-dosing-of-theratears/) and now just use 2-4 drops a day. I might use one or two more over the course of a night if I wake up to pee or something and my eye feels dry. I also do the aforementioned compresses. Before bed, I use Systane's nighttime ointment, and I sleep with a [hydrating sleep mask](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J6JELTG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title? ie=UTF8&th=1). Of all these things, I believe the TheraTears regimen is what made the biggest difference. "

10472,"Hi eye doctors! I have an oddball question. Can you tell me what this line that appeared in my cat's eye is called? I took her to the vet, but they were stumped. They had no idea what it was, they said it was not affecting her vision or causing discomfort, but they said to go to a cat eye doctor, which is hard to get into where I am. I figured I would try this sub out to see if anyone knew what the heck we were even looking at. I posted in the ask a vet sub and am copying my post from there because I did not get a response.

The test results that my prescription has barely changed, which currently I'm only using for distance and VdU use. It's a low prescription and I have an astigmatism. Overall my sight seemed alright, I do struggle to focus by otherwise it's been fine. I have however noticed something new this week - I purchased a games console (PS5) and plugged it in to my TV which is wall mounted so that you are looking up. When I'm sat down I literally can't read the text on the screen, it's like my vision drastically changes. However when I stand up from the same distance it's all readable. The difference between my monitor which I stare at daily is that it's eye level and fairly close, where as the tv I have to look up slightly and from a distance. The only other difference is the monitor is 24'inch and the TV is around 50'. Should I be worried and is there any particular reason why my sight is changing drastically? How easy are eye tests to get wrong.... should I be worried? Thanks,. "
10474,"Hello everyone, I (37M) am considering doing visual therapy ( Neurovision /Revitalvision ) to treat my amblyopia. However, I am having trouble finding relevant studies about its efficiency. My first issue-for which I haven't found an answer yet - would be regarding the ""plasticity' of the treatment - maybe my vision could improve with constant exercises, but as soon as the treatment is over, would it return to its original state. Any feedback on this kind of treatment would be appreciated. Thank you! "
10475,"Hello! Last November I saw a new eye doctor. At the time I did not have the money to buy new glasses so I have only just recently bought a pair. My old prescription was: OD -3.25 Cylinder -0.25 Axis 15 OS -2.75 Cylinder -0.25 Axis 85 My new (last November) is: OD -3.25 OS -2.75 I picked up my glasses Monday and have been experiencing increasing headaches and almost like a mild dizziness. I know it takes time to adjust so I've been trying to be patient. However, tonight I drove at night for the first time. OMG were the headlights and street lamps blinding and distracting for me. Street lights looked like they had X's coming off them and headlights seemed to form giant vertical lines as they sped past me in the opposite lane. I did so much squinting my eyes feel dry. I honestly felt sick driving home. Is this because the astigmatism was removed? If so, do I have to pay for the lenses again if I ask them to add it back in? I used all the insurance money I had getting this pair of glasses. I love them and I'm sick over the idea of not being able to use them. I do have high eye pressureâ€¦. . But it's not high enough they have to treat it just yet they said. "
10476,"I (34F) was diagnosed a few years ago and my rheumatologist put me on plaquenil and pilocarpine (salagen). My primary sjogrens complaints were joint pain in my fingers and toes, a dry cough that had been with me for what felt like forever, and bouts of brain fog and fatigue that would stop me in my tracks. I hated how the plaquenil made me feel, it helped some but I absolutely loathe taking medications and their side effects l, and the salagen had me drooling so bad in my sleep I had to change my pillowcase nightly. It was gross. The best thing I did was switch primary care to a naturopath. I've been following the autoimmune protocol diet for about a year now and am not taking any medications or supplements, with the exception of daily vitamin d. My exercise regimen has changed from HIIT style workouts to more mobility based exercises and cardio. When I was diagnosed my joint pain was so bad I had difficulty with some exercises as well as typing (I have a desk job) and now I indoor rock climb without issue. My flares have decreased substantially and the joint pain is mostly minimal unless I push things. Food and stress seem to be my major flare triggers so in addition to aip I've also done a lot of self work on stress reduction. Good luck with the rheumatologist, and definitely push for options beyond medication. There are great resources online regarding the autoimmune protocol. "
10477,"Hi all, first post, thanks in advance for the help. I'm looking to buy a new pair of glasses and have read some good things about Zeiss lenses and coatings. My prescription is -3.00 SPH -0.50 CYL 180 AXIS, my understanding is that that's pretty standard and I'm just looking for single vision lenses, likely 1.6 hi index. With that in mind, I have the following questions: * From my understanding, Duravision Platinum is a coating, but DriveSafe is both a lens type and a coating? In which case, is it possible to overlay Duravision Platinum on top of a DriveSafe lens? Is it possible to overlay multiple coatings? * I'd prefer to only have one pair of glasses for everyday use, so whilst I am aware that Duravision Platinum and DriveSafe are good at their respective jobs, I'm curious as to how well they perform at each other's specialties? So has anyone used a Platinum lens for driving, how does it cope with glare? And since the Platinum coating claims to make the ""hardest ever Zeiss lenses"" (quote from their website), how does the DriveSafe lens hold up in terms of durability, cleanability, is it hydrophobic/oleophobic etc? * The Duravision Platinum lens coating apparently has a ""more cosmetically attractive, blue residual reflection colour that generates over 20% less luminous reflectance than conventional green AR coated ZEISS lenses"", I'd like to know if this is a) visible from the outside and b) whether this distorts the colours seen through the lens at all, e.g. yellow tint if blue light is being reflected? * The DriveSafe lens apparently ""provides up to 43% larger mid-distance and up to 14% larger far-distance vision zones"" - I'd like to know if this comes at a cost of near-distance vision, e.g. using DriveSafe lens to view mobile phone screen close to the face? I appreciate that's a lot of questions and I'm sorry if I'm comparing apples to oranges here but if anyone can provide some advice that would be great. Thanks all! "

Up till this point (age 18) my vision has got progressively worse, this time it didn't get worse, in fact slightly better. Do you think there are any treatments out there? Don't get me wrong, my eyeglasses are very close to me and although people feel pity for me and perhaps that's a reason why people are cringed out by me (my thick specs), my glasses are like my skin and I dont even notice them.. well lol I've been wearing them since age 6-7 i guess.

10484,"Obligatory first post greetings! I'm in the process of being diagnosed. I have been dealing with symptoms off & on for years but I think I'm in the middle of my first major flair. Last Wednesday, I needed to stay the night at my elderly parents' who keep the house ridiculously warm so the air is very dry. I woke up several times in the middle of the night with my mouth so dry I couldn't swallow (new symptom for me). The next morning, my soft palate felt like someone had used it as a punching bag. It was super sore & felt swollen. Over the next few days, I upped my hydration even more & doubled up on my Glycerin nose spray from ENT. Mouth continued to be dry at night & upper throat stayed sore. Saturday I did a grocery pick up with every dry mouth product I could get my hands on. (Biotene rinse & spray, xylitol mints, etc) The only thing that brought temporary relief was the spray because it was a squirt not spray so I could get it to the spots that hurt. I was continuing to get more fatigued; I figured it was crappy sleep catching up with me. Sunday morning I woke up with severe pain & felt like someone had drained all my energy. Got in touch with ENT who saw me yesterday. He's awesome & he saw enough to refer me to rheumatologist after I was put off by my PCP & endocrinologist. Diagnosed me with an ulcer on my uvula & my entire soft palate/sinuses were extremely dry, swollen, & inflamed. He started me on pilocarpine, steroid pack, & augmentin. Got a little bit of relief last night but today is kicking my butt. Pain is so bad! So being new to all this, & on a steroid pack, I did a lot of research during the night. Sjogrens connects the dots for so many of the issues I've been told to live with for years or attributed to getting older. (40's) I went back through several months of this group & it has been so helpful! I post all that to ask for advice on what else I can try to relieve the pain as this ulcer heals. I have gotten pretty good at treating mouth ulcers over the years but not being able to apply meds directly to the site has me grasping at straws. TLDR: first major flair, ulcer on uvula that hurts like hell, suggestions appreciated to find relief. "
10485,"A few months ago I noticed a little smudging of white text on screens. Occasionally I will have blurred vision due to being tired or after rubbing my eyes but this has persisted for the entire time. I primarily notice it while reading text (especially bright text) I also covered both eyes to do a test of which eye it is and it seems to only be my right eye. My first guess would have been my eyes getting old but we're talking over the course of a weekend I was experiencing some blurriness. I was hoping it was just eye strain but it seems to persist. After having researched it, it what I'm seeing looks alot like astigmatism. I also noticed that when there was pressure on the side of my eye (from laying down or something similar) my vision would correct itself I went to an optometrist and they conducted a test for eye pressure/glaucoma and got some kind of readout about what prescription I would have. They also did the typical Snell eye exam in which I still scored a 20/20 vision. The doc told me that degraded vision is just part of getting older. The thing is, I can say for sure my right eye is noticeably worse and I feel like at 25 years old, there's a better explanation than regular old aging eyes. "
10486,"I wouldn't call mine a lung ""issue,"" as much as it was just general shortness of breath after even a slight exertion. I still managed to do some skiing, but I just got tired much more easily. I drank water Like Crazy to try to avoid any worse symptoms of altitude sickness, and didn't drink any alcohol while I was there. So, while I'm not sure if that was a direct factor, I felt fine (aside from the shortness of breath), and didn't get any of the more serious manifestations of altitude sickness. (And keep in mind, 10,000 feet altitude is MUCH different than 5000 or 6000 feet.) Just as an example, I wear a Fitbit that has a built in heart rate monitor. My heart rate, while I was in Breckenridge, never dropped below 90, even when I was asleep. Even getting up from the bed to go to the bathroom in the morning, my heart rate was spiking to 115-120. (My normal resting heart rate is about 74). When skiing, I was getting heart rate readings of 150+. When we returned to Denver prior to our flight back home, I felt like a million bucks, and like I could run a marathon or something. "
10487,"For the last 4 years I've worn glasses with this prescription which my ophthalmologist said gave me 20/20 vision: OD SPH: -0.75 CYL: -2.50 Axis: 178 OL SPH: PL CYL: -2.50 Axis: 179 PD: 70 I recently went in for a vision exam and got this prescription which he said gives me 20/15 vision. It was with positive cylinders but I've converted them to the negative version here: OD SPH: -1.00 CYL: -2.50 Axis: 173 OL SPH: -0.25 CYL: -3.00 Axis: 001 PD: 70 As far as I can tell, my prescription is not that different. However, I seem to have visual distortion / fishbowl in the periphery and vertical lines even near the center of my vision seem slightly slanted. Is this normal and something I just need to get used to? I had zero distortion in my older prescription even when I first started wearing them. "
10488,"I had intra-ocular lens implants more than 10 years ago, and it's still one of the best things I ever did. And I figure it has more than paid for itself because I no longer need contact lens solution or glasses or contacts (well, er, in recent years I need readers for up close vision but those are cheap). When I was considering vision surgery they said I was not a good candidate for Lasik because that surgery cuts some of the nerves that tell your eyes to create tears and they might not grow back well. But the IOL is a teeny incision that doesn't disturb the cornea. My eyes are still dry but never painful anymore and being able to see 24/7 is fantastic (I was legally blind without contacts/glasses). I still do have to supplement drops a few times a day and when first waking up in the morning. Try the walmart generic artificial tears - it's the same ingredients as hypo tears but 1/10th the price. Been using restasis for about 6 months and it's only made a teeny improvement but I hear it can take a long time. So I would not give up on the xiidra just yet. I would suggest supplementing tears especially during the summer. "

10493,"Yeah, slow gum recession over the last ten years. My dentist could not explain it then, but now understands why. "
10494,"I've been wearing glasses since kindergarten and contacts since age 16. My prescription has hardly changed since my early twenties and for my contacts I'm currently at ||L|R| |:-|:-|:-| |PWR|\- 2.75|\- 3.00| |CYL|\- 1.75|\- 1.25| |AX|180|010| With my glasses I see truly razor sharp, they are amazing. No contacts, however, ever came close to that perfect correction. Most I've tried made my eyes dry and painful and all have kept my vision somewhat blurry. I've worked with many different opticians for the past 10 years, trying to find contacts with which I could see as sharp as with my glasses but to no avail. I see sharp with most of them in the first hour of wearing them, then they gradually get blurrier. I was told often that this is normal and that I can never expect the same correction as with glasses. 3 years ago I was switched to Biofinity toric contacts because my eyes were always so dry and painful and they have been a gods end. Really comfortable! If only I'd see sharp with them, which I don't. Multiple eye tests with multiple opticians and eye doctors and many different trial lenses later I still haven't found one that's not blurry. I think it's a matter of fit, because sometimes I do see razor sharp with my contacts too ... but only for a split second until the next blink and everything is blurry again. So it's like for a split second they sit exactly right only to move again immediately. I have run out of Biofinitys now and when I went to refill my prescription my previous optician turned out to have retired. His successor suggested to switching me to the AirOptix Hydraglydes for Astigmatism because in his words ""Coopervision is terrible quality"" and also the AirOptix Hydraglydes will fit a lot more snug and thus no longer move on my eye resulting in that blurry vision. Does anyone else share this experience/opinion? Is it worth a try? Concerning quality/comfort I'm very satisfied with the Biofinitys so I'm a bit hesitant especially since the AirOptix are a lot more expensive here. "
10495,Your prescription is a little more complicated than over the counter. Your astigmatism will keep those from working well for you. You could use 2.25 but custom made to your prescription readers or bifocals or Progressive lenses will work best.

10497,"Several times a day, I experience a moving grayness, an opacity, that is significantly different than any of my floaters. The grayness occurs at the very top of my vision, I perceive it to be in my left eye, it seems to involve a left-to-right or right-to-left movement, and is very transient ( 1 sec). Sometimes the grayness is bigger, sometimes quite small. I only notice it in indoor light; when my eyes are closed, or when I am outside, I do not see it at all. It doesn't seem to have any correlation with moving; in fact, I normally notice it while sitting down and reading, looking at the computer screen, or talking. My vision otherwise is fine, and there is no pain associated with it. I've been having this, though, for about 6 months, and it seems like the grayness is getting slightly larger.

I also used to smoke marijuana habitually and have stopped. I will probably start taking edibles again because it helps with pain but I can no longer smoke, so vaping is probably not the best.

10503,"I recently had an update RX where the prism I was prescribed was BO and then a new prescribition after getting a recheck (felt like something wasn't right) and was prescribed BI through Neurolenses. The general RX also changed slightly. When I picked up the new glasses they are blurry. Not distortion need to adjust, but flat out blurry. Could the adjustment of the prisms cause blurriness? I've worn glasses for 30 years so I know what an adjustment feels like, but the prisms are a fairly new addition. "
10504,"Hi, thanks for doing this. I had Cross Linking done about 10 years ago. After that I was fitted for Scleral Lenses, which improved my visual acuity but still had the light halos and double vision thing going on, which made wearing them mostly useless. I'm hesitant to spend money going to a different contact lens company with no guarantees that they'll be any better. Do you know of any lens brand that would be better for this issue? "
10505,"The 10 day dose of doxy is strange. Doxy is to be taken long-term for MGD, and it can be taken low dose (20 mg twice a day) to get the anti-inflammatory effect without killing any good gut bacteria. It sounds like you have a stye on the corner of that eye and the warm compresses will help. You can also give your eyelids little pinches after the warm compress to help the oils come out. "

10507,"From what I have read so far: . Our eyes are designed to process natural, reflected light better than self-illuminated objects (i.e. artificial light). E-Ink wins in this regard and can help reduce strain when compared to LCD screens. https://qr.ae/pGgxDA It's an answer from someone of an eye care hospital in India, not a research paper, but it makes sense to me. Also the reduction in blink rate seems to be related to staring into self-illuminated objects, TV, smartphones, screens. When the eyes dry out or become fatigued due to reading on a computer screen, it can be an indication of Computer Vision Syndrome. Computer Vision Syndrome can be prevented by taking regular breaks, focusing on objects far from the screen, having a well-lit workplace, or using a blink reminder application. Studies suggest[15] that adults can learn to maintain a healthy blinking rate while reading or looking at a computer screen using biofeedback. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinking However, I do think there's much more research required in that regard. But from my personal subjective experience with e-book readers I would definitely say yes, e-ink is definitely better for my eyes compared to reading from self-illuminated screens. "
10508,"I was recently sent to the rheumatologist by my very reluctant doctor to get some autoimmune testing done after being sick for years. my ANA test came back neg at regular doc, and my blood work was fine hence the reluctance. I recently received test results back for my extractable nuclear antibody, and the results (in my opinion<U+00BF>) correlate directly to Soeren's syndrome which makes sense because my symptoms match exactly. The only thing is the numbers are a bit weird. For example, I had a SSA antibody of 1 unit (negative) and an SSB antibody of 32 units (positive). the reference range is ""20 units negative, 20-25 units borderline, 25 units positive.

10512,"I went to the optometrist yesterday, my last visit was probably 8 years ago and at that time I measured 20/5 in both eyes (zero errors at 20/5). Over the last year I've noticed some loss of distance clarity and since I'm now 40+ I figured I should have a more recent exam and ended up measuring 20/10 in both eyes. Then the optometrist said ""let's see what reader prescription you need"", before measuring anything. I questioned this and she just said ""You're 43"". This immediately set off internal alarms, but all that was left was the ""1 or 2"" phase of the exam I just finished up and left. So, why the statement that everyone over 40 needs reading glasses? I understand what physically creates the need for reading glasses and that it is part of the aging process, but surely there are a few rare individuals that do not need reading glasses until 45, or even 50. She prescribed +0.50 readers and then said I would probably have to special order them as I would not be able to find any at a drug store. Was this 1) just a money grab? 2) just a generalized statement because 98% of 40+ need readers? 3) something magical happening on everyone's 40th birthday? 4) something else? I really am just looking to understand the assumption that someone with excellent distance vision and no complaints on near vision would need readers before bothering to check that. "
10513,"Hi, Too make a long story short I was diagnosed with Steroid-induced glaucoma back in July due to a chronic case of bilateral anterior uveitis by a Glaucoma specialist. I never had a VF test and the only thing the Doc went by was an oct scan which show minimal damage on my right eye, my thin corneas L:497 R:492 and my high pressures of L:28 R:33 and that's the highest they have ever been. She started me on Diamox and told me to continue using Dorzolamide & Combigan three times a day as I was doing already. If that didn't bring my pressures down I would need surgery to avoid any damage to my nerves. Three days after the consultation I spoke with my Uveitis specialist about the diagnosis and I was taken off the steroids. The following week I had a follow-up appt with the Glaucoma Specialist to check my pressures. They were L:7 R:9, and she told to stopped using the Diamox and continue with the drop regime the same as before. Two weeks later I went in again and my pressures were L:10 & R:11. Two weeks after that I went in again and my pressures were the same as before L:10 & R:11. After the last visit she told me I didn't have Glaucoma that my nerve damage may have been from birth and to continue life as usual. She didn't give me any follow up appt or anything she just told me that if I was ever put back on steroids to call back for a follow-up appt with her that's it. Let me point out that I had high pressures since May, three weeks after staring the steroids and my pressures at their highest were L:28 & R:33. During these time I was never told to stopped exercising, doing yoga or anything a regular POAG patient may be told to avoid. Fast forward to three weeks ago, I went in for a check-up to my uveitis specialist and after checking my pressures L:12 R:13 she asked me if I was still using the drops to which I reply that I was, but the last time I use them was last night at 10:00PM. My appt was at 12:30PM, so before going in to get check-up I did an intense strength training workout( ex: squats, deadlifts, crunches). I told her that and she said that it was more of a reason to stopped the drops since my pressures were still low even after all that. I told her I was hesitant so she told me to follow up with my glaucoma specialist. This past Friday, I went in to see my glaucoma specialist, the appt was at 2:00. So, again I stopped using the drops at 10:00PM the night before and I did some heavy exercise before going in. She again check my pressures and they were 10 in both eyes. She said that the combigan was probably still in my system, so she wasn't sure if I needed the drops or not. She said that to tell if the drops are needed you need to be off them for three days, but she didn't have any appt available until three weeks later so to minimized the damage if the pressures were high. I told her I had a follow-up appt with my uveitis specialist today so she told me to stay off the drops during the weekend and if the pressures were good I could stay off them. Today I went in for a follow up visit and my pressures using a tono-pen were L:12 & R:14. My uveitis specialist said that there were nice and low but she would measure then again in 20 minutes to see if the pressures were still low. She measure my iop this time using the gold standard and they were L:11 & R:10. She said that those were some nice numbers and that I definitely didn't have to use the drops. I called my Glaucoma specialist with the numbers as she told me to do on Friday, and she said that I could stay off the drops, but to come back in 6 month for a VF test to see if there was any vision loss. This brings me to my questions are these pressures any good? or could I still have Glaucoma? also why would my Glaucoma specialist tell me to come back in 6 moths for a VF Test when one was not perform during my initial visit? I asked her and she said it was routine test nothing to worry about and finally how can you tell if your eye pressure is high without using a tonometer? Thank You P.S I would also like to point out that I suffer from OCD and at this point in time I don't know if I'm fixed on this or if I need an actual second opinion from another doc. "
10514,"I woke up this morning with blurry vision in my left eye. I blinked a few times and it still continued to be blurry. I'd get focus after 10 seconds but once I'd blink, the vision would get blurry again. I put saline in my eye, and it was still blurry initially but went away after 1 to 2 min. In total the episode lasted about 10 minutes. Is this something I should be concerned about? Does it sound like dry eyes (I was also sleeping on that eye when I woke up) or could it be something like MS. Just curious what your advice would be. This has never happened to me before. I wear eye glasses occasionally to see far away. I do not wear contacts nor do I have any other medical problems or diseases . "
10515,"I have always hade 20:20 vision but up until about 10 years ago, I had double vision. Nobody ever told me that you were supposed to be able to relax your eyes and see one image. I thought everyone had to force the two images together. 2 eyes=2 images, right? So when the eye doctor figured out that I was seeing double of everything she did a test where I would close one eye and look at an object in the center of my site. Then, without moving my head, I would switch open eyes. Every time I had to move my second eye quite a bit to center the image. This is not a big deal, but even when she corrected for the horizontal and vertical difference between my eyes, one image was rotated slightly. I was literally 45 years old before I saw a real stereo image. Since then I have been to two other eye doctors and nobody seems willing to take a stab at which eye is messed up. Both have tried slight rotations using prisms and nothing has worked as well as the apparatus my first doctor used. I literally cried the first time I could relax my eyes and see normally. I need to know what it is called to have one rotated image. It is also slightly color diminished for red colors. More specifically, I would like to know if there is a surgery that could be done to fix this and/or if I could qualify for laceck (sp?) surgery and if they could just shave my cornea to fix it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. "

It's possible that your GI issues are playing a role. I would recommend reading a blog post titled ""my sjogren's recovery journey""<U+009D>. His story sounds very similar to yours. I would also recommend getting tested for SIBO even if your not having symptoms. There is a connection with Sjogrens that has been documented in some of the research. "
10518,"When I was 16 I failed the vision screening at the DMV. They have a little device you look into and read the letters on - I couldn't see the letters on the left at all, thought I'd aced it until the person said I failed because I had actually started reading the line halfway through. So I went and got my vision assessed by a specialist who said I had a lazy eye and my brain was ignoring input from it. He wrote me a waiver and said all I had to do to pass the test was close my right eye, read the letters in the device, then open my right eye and read the rest. He said there was no point trying to treat it or I'd just see double. I don't remember what the result was but it sure wasn't 20/20. I went back to the dmv, redid the vision screening doing what he suggested and passed it perfectly. Now, a year and a half ago (a little more than 10 years after the dmv experience) I went to get my eyes checked for the first time since then. They determined my vision is 20/20 in both eyes with no binocular vision issues. I even had her recheck after telling her about my previous experience and she seemed to think either I was lying or the DMV machine and eye dr from before were both mistaken. What do you make of it?

I went to the optometrist because my right eye vision continued to be blurry and cause some strain/headaches. Even with the new prescription the problem persists and I am wondering why this could be? It's definitely better with glasses on, but it's still blurry enough to be annoying and cause eye strain.

10524,"Hello everyone, I'm new to this forum. I'm a 25 year old medicine student, a graduate of medicine science program, and I've been having real difficulties lately in my life due to problems with my eyes. It started more than a year ago, in August 2020, where I started feeling dizziness/sleepiness from watching lectures on Zoom. It was not a true vertigo sensation, just a feeling of lightheadedness, and a feeling that I'm not sure of my movements. It's hard for me to explain what that means, but it's like if I'm moving in a direction, I need to focus as I'm not sure of not falling. At first I was not sure the problem I had was with my eyes, only later all symptoms I had were pointing in that direction. Reading also became impossible as I used to get so tired just from reading half a page. It's not possible to be a medicine student and also suffer from ""not-being-able-to-read"", so a few months ago I decided to take a year off from University because of the situation. Being at this situation, at first I thought it was a problem with eyeglasses and maybe they need adjustment. I've had multiple eye exams where I changed the prescription countless times. It didn't help, and only months later, I was diagonsed with Exophoria. I had never even heard of this condition before. I was given a laptop app called HTS (Home Vision Therapy), and within 2-3 weeks, I was alot better. I could read up to 50-60 pages a day with no problem whatsoever. A month or two after though, I had a regression of my condition and now, I can barely even watch a movie without feeling sleepiness and dizziness. New symptoms have emerged aswell that I didn't find on the internet. My eyes can't focus on a target, they're always twitching and moving (sort of a small nystagmus), and so I'm dizzy all the time. I'm not sure how do I continue from here. Should I resume doing exercises again? Should I try prism glasses? Is surgery even a solution in my case? I'm desperate to going back to school, be the top student I once was, and right now it's not possible. Sometimes I question if I don't suffer from something else besides the CI.. what if I was misdiagnosed? I mean, it took doctors months to tell me I have CI, what if they're mistaken? What should I do? "

10527,Pressures were not too high 21 to 24 . But doctor thinks that taking the drops will stop any more nerve changes . 
10528,So my old optometrist about 2 years ago gave me a -3.50 on both eyes with -1.00 cylinder on both eyes Aswell. When I went in October for a new exam the only change in prescription is on the left eye with a +.25 change in about 2 years. I complained to him about ghosting and went to his his office again in December but he said the cause may be fixed with nose nub replacements because my glasses were sitting to low because the nose nubs were gone and the centering was off or he could put prisms. I thought he misunderstood that i have double vision but I thought I did a good job telling him it was ghosting that has been there without my glasses and I noticed it when I needed a new prescription. The issue didn't go away so I asked for my prescription (this is where I found out the difference I thought was greater). I was skeptical about this so I went to another optometrist about 1 and a half months later and he gave me a new prescription of -4.25 on both eyes and -1.50 cylinder. The issue is that he said the prescription could've changed that much in about 3 months but I forgot to tell him that the prescription only changed that much (.25) in 2 years and that in reality the change would've been in 1.5 months as my old optometrist did not give me a new prescription when I went to his office for my vision issue with the new glasses. My glasses I got were the first with what I consider expensive anti glare coating so they ended up costing about $170 after insurance but are now useless. My question is should I tell my old optometrist anything about this I hopes of a reimbursement? Also could it be my fault the prescription was off because I might've lead him wrong when he asks what number I see better with? I kind of waited a bit but to be fair most of the waiting was appointment waiting and me trying the new glasses out in case it's a matter of adjusting to them. Something else I want to note is that I remember looking at the optometrist screen on my follow up appointment and seeing -4.25 on it but when I asked for my prescription later it only says 3.75 and I assume that's the one they used for the expensive anti glare coating. Should I just take the L? Edit: Title mentions PD but I'm stupid. Old pd says 31.5 in both eyes and new one says 63 but I didn't realize adding my both eyes in my old one is the same pd in my new one.

10530,"Lately, I've been very very worried about my eyes and their future. I seriously don't want to go blind. There aren't a lot of people like me who are young but have extremely high prescriptions for their eyesight and sometimes I feel so alone and scared that I could go blind any second. Currently I'm **15F living in the UK**, I'm **-10.00L with -3.50 CYL** and **-11.75 with -3.25 CYL**. I'm so scared for my eyesight. Every single day I'm scared to wake up the next morning completely blind. I check my peripheral vision constantly since the doctors said to watch out for any dark shadows or curtains moving across my vision. Today, I was at school in my English lesson â€” and I saw a **flash** moving along the bottom edge of my right eye for a brief second. This happened when the lights were off though. This particular flash always happens in the same place, in the same eye. I don't know why but it happens sometimes either when I'm sleeping or when I'm in the dark, usually only once. 2 weeks ago I went to the hospital for a dilated eye exam because of these symptoms and they said they were normal for a highly myopic person, and that my **retina was thinning** in my left eye, and my right eye had **2 macular holes...** I couldn't help but get extremely anxious. Is this really serious? And how rare is it in young people? The doctor said this isn't really a cause for concern since it's normal for extreme myopia but I really want to make sure so I don't have to cry myself to sleep every night. Prior to that eye exam I had my eye pressure checked and it was **slightly** above the average (but they said it was fine, maybe my eyes were being abnormal that day) is this a cause for concern? Also the doctor who checked my eyes said that the jelly inside my eyes are apparently a weird shape. Not sure what that's supposed to mean but is that a serious problem?

10531," Does taking breaks, following 20-20 rule, sunlight etc help prevent myopia? No, it slows down progression. if a guy got myopia after using computer for 12hrs a day for 6 months, does it mean he'd still have got it after 12 months if he had only used it for 6 hrs a day Yes . If a person gets mild myopia, say at the age of 20, is it guaranteed that he'd go legally blind No, that's nearly impossible. Myopia progresses up to the age of about 14 usually.

Looking down is the least uncomfortable position and rubbing or blinking really hard makes it worse. Make sure the lens is absolutely clean, no fluffs or little fibres on it and put a drop of solution on it when you put it in. After putting it in, instruct your son to look downward and just blink calmly, not rub the eyes or look around. The gritty feeling is normal, just be persistant and try it every day. Try to let him keep them in for longer than 10 minutes because it actually gets better the longer he has them in. If that goes well for a couple of days, send him to bed. "
10546,"Both my eldest and middle sons have KC. Middle diagnosed first when he was 6 (11 now) and have CXL to within 6 months of diagnosis. Eldest was diagnosed because middle was diagnosed. He hasn't had any treatments yet, but his was not severe enough to yet. I think it's going to be soon though (he's 12). I would try and push for treatment if I were you. Best of luck ðŸ'šðŸ'šðŸ'š. "
10547,"Yeah, the optometrist immediately referred her to an ophthalmologist, so she went straight there from her eye exam. She was given glaucoma drops to use and has her follow up visit coming up with a different ophthalmologist. She has trouble reading subtitles in tv shows and small print, so there definitely has been some vision loss. I'm just wondering if her baseline pressures make it harder for them to treat effectively (I'm guessing 30 to 20 is easier reach than 50 to 20?) resulting in a quicker timeline in going blind. "

I have heard you can't trust them with prisms, especially that small of a prism, and some won't even fill a prism only Rx, but insurances also won't pay for them because they are a clear prism (which I am bitter about). Which leads me to can I trust any of the online purveyors of eyewear to make my Rx correctly? Can anyone, even non-prism wearers, trust any of them? "
10554,"Do what you need to do to take your mind off it, if you can. I've been in a similar boat as you before, just couldn't get them. Relax, do something else and try again if you feel up to it. Using a mirror helps and it doesn't take much to dislodge them. If it ain't coming out, leave it be. A single night with them in isn't going to do any lasting damage. You'll likely find them on your pillow in the morning. Plenty of people do it over and over after a night drinking or out of choice. In short, you'll be absolutely fine if you can't get them out.

10557,"I wore contacts only for about 15 years. I recently switched to glasses a month ago and have been applying eye drops. The blood vessels don't seem to be lessening much. Are these going to be permanent? I saw an optometrist on here talk about an RX steroid/antibiotic drop. I was wondering if I should look into this. I really dislike how these blood vessels look, they remind me of weeds growing. My eye doctor never made a big deal out of my blood vessels. "
10558,"I am about to get fitted with a scleral lens by an optometrist in his early 40s. The optometrist is also the company owner of the clinic, which does not specialise in speciality lenses. He was quoted in a well known optometry society, the AOP org, in addition he had been working as an NHS optometric adviser for a few years before starting his own company. My major concerns: 1. Is he too 'young' (early 40s) to have sufficient experience in fitting scleral lenses? I heard it is always good to find someone considerably older when fitting tricky lenses like the scleral, as they would have more experience? 2. Being a company owner means the optometrist would have to invest a significant amount of time to mange the business, instead of investing time to hone optometric skills? 3. The clinic does not specialise in scleral lenses, it is more like a high-street walk-in optician. My question may sound ridiculous and I do not want to ridicule young optometrists or business owners, but since the scleral lens will cost me some fortune, I think it will be really helpful to know. (Abit about my conditions: Moderate myopia, no KC, no astigamtism etc. Didn't like the lack of peripheral vision from RGPs/hated soft CLs due to dry eyes, so decided to to switch to sclerals) Many thanks. "
10559,"In regard to the things that can slow down Myopia, I'm living this at this exact moment. My 12 yr old just got the standard chart exam at his annual pediatricians visit. Two years ago at age 10 he had significant trouble reading the chart with his right eye. Went to pediatric ophthalmologist at pediatrician's urging and he ended up with glasses to use if he was in the back of class. His other eye was strong and compensating when working together so it was not recommended to use them all the time or do anything additional. So fast forward to this week and he's never really worn the glasses because (thank you Covid) online school. Today he had an exam at the optometrist after having trouble with the same eye even when wearing the glasses at the pediatrician's office. That eye went from -.075 to -.25 a significant difference. He now either needs to start wearing MiSight 1 day contacts or using low dose Atropine drops every night until his eyes stop growing at about age 18. I'm now wondering if this shouldn't have been a course of action 2 years ago but what's done is done. The treatments will slow the progression of his Myopia by about 50% but won't stop it. That only happens when the eyes stop growing apparently. So from one parent to another, I'd say 9 is probably a good age to start annual exams with an optometrist if the only thing they are getting is the school exam. Having glasses or not may not accelerate/decelerate a medical issue, but it may make a difference in the classroom. A lot of times kids have minor trouble with vision that they don't even realize is an issue and so don't say anything. Better safe than sorry. "
10560,"I'm a M 18yo. When I last had my eyes checked out, which was a year ago, my prescription was - 3 R and - 4 L, only spherical. Now after the lockdown, had it checked last week and to my surprise: - 2 sph and 0.75 cyl in R and just - 3.5 sph in my L. The cyl can be explained as I used to have prescription for torric lenses a couple years ago before it decided to subdue. Now during the lockdown, much like everybody else, my digital device usage skyrocketed compared to earlier and I was certain my eyesight was gonna worsen very badly. Now after the test, I see this. I just can't imagine how this would happen. Any idea as to what may have happened that may have lead to this? Thanks Edit: Maybe worth to mention I use contacts, Bausch n Lomb pure vision 2 to be precise. Also I used up the supply of 6 monthly lens over the period of around a year, which is really bad I know but didn't have a choice as optic stores were closed and I broke my pair of glasses. "
10561,If it takes longer than 24 hours to use one vial you might be fine with regular eye drops... It's still okay to use one all day or over night as long as the tip doesn't touch your skin or eye and is set in a clean place. I wouldn't do it more than 24 regularly though.

It's to the point where once I get home I'm pretty much just out for the count and just need to close my eyes. I will add that it's snowy where I live so that definitely adds to the brightness outside. But I've lived here my whole life and never experienced this before.

10568,"Eye diagnosis please :) Hello, my name is Ryan. I am a 19 year old man from Australia. For as long as i can remember, I have had these pink, floating dots in my vision. They aren't always there, mainly showing up when i am tired. These dots only occur in my left eye, they don't show up when i close my right. I haven't really given them much thought until now, since i have had them since i was a child. The spots are only in once small patch of my vision (in the middle) but they move rapidly sideways, like a never-ending row. I am unsure of wether or not it is common, but i could not find an answer through googling. I should also add that I recently had a benign brain tumour removed recently. I had a Pilocytic astrocytoma, approx. 26x25x35mm in size, located in the left hemisphere of my cerebellum. Due to the early, incidental finding, it was able to be removed before it could put any pressure on my fourth ventricle. I had my first surgery in Dec of 2019 which removed a majority of the tumour, second surgery was in march 2021, removing the last of the tumour. They are not sure how long the tumour had been there, but due to its slow growth it would have been a while. The only symptoms of this where the occasional migraine. I also had speedy recoveries after both surgeries, walking the day after, spending about a week total in hospital. I am unsure of wether or not this matters, but thought it would be good to include. Since the tumour removal, i have noticed no change in the pink spots. Thanks in advance :) PS. I forgot to add this, unsure if it is needed though. I am 201cm (6'7""<U+009D>), 90kg (200lb) Caucasian.

10576,I've been wearing contacts mainly more than glasses since I was 14 I'm 27 now. Ever since like a little over a month ago my previous eye doctor told me I had slight elevated pressure. She thought it was from using prednisone drops so I stopped them and it still never went away. My vision fees not necessarily blurry but as if i was looking through slightly smudged glasses and I have some eye fatigue I guess you would call it like where if I zone out like how your eyes get when you space out or when your super tired and can't keep your eyes open my vision gets blurry but if I snap out of it then they go back to the regular slightly foggy/smudged glasses vision. I went to see a new eye dr two weeks ago and he thinks the drops still could be the cause or allergies maybe but he doesn't think it's anything bad or anything I can go blind from which is a relief! I do have another appointment with him next week again so he can check my vision this time and I can see if he has any more ideas what this could be. I did accidentally sleep in my contacts when I was like 16/17 because I wasn't informed about how bad it is and it caused a corneal abrasion scar on my left eye which the scar is still there but I've never slept in them since and never had problems with my vision from the scar or anything before. Any suggestions what this could be till I can get into my eye doctor next week? I'm currently trying blink eye drops and my eye dr gave me a sample of these allergy drops whatever kind start with a B I forgot what their called. Also my eyes get slightly red too off and on. 
10577,"I was misdiagnosed at 14 & 15 as astigmatism by an ophthalmologist, even went so far as to give me a prescription for contacts and had them made. It was actually when I went to pick them up another doctor said he couldn't sell them to me because it would be unethical because he suspected I had keratoconus. Anyway, many years later and a cxl on each eye, I started losing vision in an eye and my doctor diagnosed me with astigmatism on top of the (now controlled) keratoconus. "

10580,"I've tried finding some info in the scientific literature, but it seems there haven't been many long term studies following Sjogrens patients who were diagnosed at a young age. I've only found one paper that indicated mouth dryness tends to progress drastically in early disease (like in the first 5 years) and then remains mostly steady. Other older papers seem to imply the dryness stays relatively stable for most of your life. Hopefully some of you can help me understand this better. I'm really scared of what my future holds and I'm trying to get as much accomplished in my life as I possibly can, just in case this ends up causing disability. I know everyone is different, but I'd like to have some idea of what to expect. I feel like a ticking time bomb. If you've had Sjogrens for many years, how stable has your dryness been? Has it generally been manageable? Do you still retain some salivary gland function? Can you still get some flow by chewing gum, sucking on candy, or taking pilocarpine or evoxac? If complete dryness occurs, how do you manage this? I don't know how a person could eat, breath, or speak if all mucosal membranes are completely destroyed. Seems like that could be life threatening, but I never hear anything about it. Has anyone participated in any clinical trials or know of any promising research? Any idea how realistic it is to think we might be able to regenerate damaged glands in the next 10 years or so? Thanks! "

Unfortunately at the time of diagnosis, I had tried pretty much all of the medication options. Here's the thing. This is just the ugly truth that I didn't learn until I was 15+ years in of trying to get back to ""normal"". Even with a diagnosis and medication, life still never got back to normal. There are better days. And there are still really bad days. Most days are somewhere in the middle. The most important parts of having better days are in your hands already - light activity, getting adequate sleep, diet and exercise, stress management, reducing inflammation, etc. So while I hope you're able to get a diagnosis and start some medication, I would encourage you to start with the things that weigh more heavily on your success long-term.

10586,"Hi, So I was diagnosed last year after my second child. My whole life I have been waking up with really dry mouth, I have paid thousands of dollars in dental work. Now my eyes have been acting up, blurry until I blink a MILLION times. I don't know what yet, but mainly when I eat sugar/carbs my joints hurt till the point where I can't sit or move. Brain fog has been worse since I've gotten older, I can only focus of a few tasks a day... and of course... fatigue. I feel lazy because I literally can't function some days. I feel like the people around me don't understand and I wonder if I am making everything up. Anyways, I want to get eye surgery to correct my vision which has been getting increasingly worse over time (-12 at this point). I just want to know I am not alone :( I am only 27 and I put a pause on the rheumatologist because she wasn't really giving me much and my bill was out of the water! "
10587,"It was checked by a normal doctor from the clinic not a specialist and I have never had this before in my life it just began to happen this year, is it possible to develop it at my age (im 17). "
10588,At 32 KC is probably done progressing. I would still have corneal mapping done yearly to make sure it's not progressing. If your case is mild then you should have no problem using soft contact lenses for astigmatism. I use the biofinity torics and they are great. 
10589,"Assuming your person wrote right eye on top and left eye on the bottom, your right eye's prescription is -4.50 SPH (no astigmatic correction), and your left eye's prescription is -3.00 -0.75 X 117. The bottom right is PD which stands for pupillary distance - the distance between your pupils, which will help the lab put the optical center of your lenses in the right spot. "
10590,"RP comes in many forms, some 8 year olds get it, and some in their 40's, it's a big tent retinal issue. I would guess that you might not have RP and have some other things going on perhaps. But if an Optho took a look at your retina and didn't see the traditional RP markings, you're probably okay. Also, you would likely notice a dramatic shift in your night vision (Not seeing things until it's too late) before you notice your peripheral vision getting worse. I noticed yellow swirls in my night vision while I would lay in bed at night, which turned out to be a symptom when I was around 15/16, but wasn't diagnosed until I was around 27. Try not to stress yourself out, especially since you don't have a diagnosis saying you have it. :). "
10591,"Unfortunately not about the contacts. Contacts have been a nightmare. My cone has actually moved it used to be further up, above my pupil. It's positioning has made lense fitting really difficult and then caused additional problems. Dry eyes though I manage well. I use a gel at night and drops through the day and I couldn't be without either to manage. I think it may be hereditary as I don't have hayfever/allergies and I don't ever recall rubbing my eyes. My mum likely has a mild form but manageable with glasses. She only started wearing glasses in her twenties for a slight astigmatism which then has been maintained for over 20 years now. "

10593,Corneal transplants can be miraculous. BUT it is major surgery with a long recovery period. CuredOfKC has transplants that have lasted 40 years as I recall. That is exceptionally long. Many transplant patients still need contact lenses to get good vision. You don't want to do corneal transplants unless you have exhausted all other options.

Anyone else? "
10598,"Since you tolerate this imbalance now, I'd predict you function very well without correction after 45, when everybody else is wearing bifocals. "
10599,I first noticed symptoms of KC in my worse eye around 1970 although I think with today's technology it would have been spotted a few years earlier. My better eye progressed well into my 30s. It is hard to say if it was truly stable during my 20s when my diagnosis was unilateral KC because there was no corneal topography to pickup early and subtle progression. My advice for anyone who wants to take a watchful waiting approach before doing CXL is to keep up with at least annual exams including topography at least until you are in your 40s. Many doctors will want evidence of active progression before doing CXL in any case. 
10600,I'm 27. Does it help to know I was involved in a rear ending (the victim) that was enough to crack the frame on my Subaru not long before I got the new prescription and then the issue happened immediately after I started wearing my new glasses? 
10601,"Fourteen-year gap between the normal ANA and the positive ANA. MY guess is it started two years before the first normal ANA, but my rheum says no because I am doing too well. Here's something from Andrew Weil's website: * **Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA**): Anti-Nuclear Antibodies react against normal components of cell nuclei and are present in about 70 percent of Soeren's patients. * **Rheumatoid Factor (RF):** This test usually is recommended when rheumatoid arthritis is suspected, but 60 to 70 percent of Sjogren's patients test positive. * **Sjogren's antibodies, anti-SS-A (or Ro) and anti-SS-B (or La)**: This test can establish the presence of specific antibodies that are markers for Soeren's Syndrome. Seventy percent of patients are positive for SS-A, and 40 percent for SS-B. So you can see there are lots of people diagnosed with Sjogren's who test negative for all of this stuff. Here is something interesting: I've had rosacea for around 20 yrs. I did the topical antibiotic thing. I asked my docs if rosacea was connected to any other health issues. No, they said, although that didn't sound right to me. Now I've read that people with rosacea are more likely to develop autoimmune diseases. After I changed my diet I stopped using the topical antibiotic. My skin has improved from 3.5 or 4 on a 10-scale with meds to 2 on a 10-scale without. Still have the dryness, though! (If they recommend a salivary gland biopsy, do your research first--I would be reluctant to get one. Too many people here have reported problems.). "
10602,"20s, probably not, but it is interesting to think about if we will adjust our definition of presbyopia. After all, we diagnose patients presbyopic when the loss of lens elasticity causes their comfortable range of vision to become insufficient in daily life. But if people's visual worlds are moving nearer won't we begin reaching that situation earlier? Or do we just insist that they hold their smartphone outstretched in hand, nothing is wrong with them yet? "
10603,"I recently went to the optician for the first time in 2 years (the time before that was also 2 years). Previously never had any problems, and was always told I very good eyesight. However, at the most recent visit I was alarmed when the optometrist told me there was a freckle at the back of my left eye. She didn't seem at all concerned - though as someone with quite severe health anxiety I was. I pressed her on this point and she said she wasn't concerned. This has never been mentioned before at any previous visit to the opticians throughout my life. It also transpired that I now have raised eye pressures in both eyes (left 18, right 21). The optometrist described these as at the higher end of the normal range, and as a result wants to see me yearly rather than every other year. The test used was the air puff one, which I understand from reading around is not necessarily the most accurate. It may be worth noting that this was my first time at a new opticians. I guess my question is, given that eye freckles don't seem to be something that just appears as an adult, why was this never picked up previously? Does anyone else have any similar experiences? Naturally my health anxiety leads me to jump to the worst conclusions. "
10604,"High myope here too (-8D in both eyes with mild astigmatism), I got laser photocoagulation twice in 2 years (and I'm 19) to treat lattice and horshoe tear due to retinal thinning and also I have floaters. I have been to doctor multiple times and, I'm worried too. But my doctor said, there is no point of worrying in that as long as you get regular checkup (for him once in 6 months) and look up for the signs (flashes, sudden onset of lots of floaters, decrease in vision), eat healthy and live your life. You probably can have flashes due to posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) since for us myopes it happens at early age than others do. Ask your doctor all the questions you have, they can only better tell you about this after looking into your eye (a dilated eye exam). "

10606,"Hey all So as a glasses wearer for about 18 years I've finally made the transition to contact lenses. I'm currently using the trial lens I got from my optometrist and they feel great. During my exam, they told me that I have astigmatism in my left and now looking at the left lens they've given me, it's for astigmatism (which makes sense). So my question is, when ordering contacts, do I need to order one pack for astigmatism and one for ""normal"" eyes? Or when I put in my prescription would they automatically know that my left eye has astigmatism? Asking because if i'm ordering 6 months worth of dailies, wanted to know if i'm spending more money than i'm supposed to by ordering two different pack but only using the left Astimatism lens and the right ""normal"" lens.

10609,"Thanks for replying! I have to take them off for writing, working in the kitchen, etc. As far as needing to go find them is concerned, that doesn't happen too often. Maybe if I'm watching baseball and I'm not in the living room, but another 20 feet from my usual chair, in the dining room or kitchen. I've never felt that my close vision needed help, but the last thing the doctor did during the exam was to show me the difference between the SV prescription and the one with the addition. The difference was certainly noticeable. Now of course he didn't show me the difference between the 1.25 addition and no correction at all. I suspect that would be a bit more subtle. Would it be a good experiment to go to Walgreens and pick up a pair of +1.25 reading glasses to see if they are noticeably helpful? Clearly this is not a case of my NEEDING progressives at this point; I guess the better question is whether they'd be a worthwhile investment for my use cases, or if I should wait a couple of years until I need a bit more power. I think you've made me see that only I can really answer that. Thanks again! "

My brother, who is 12 years my senior, was diagnosed with rheumatic fever, he actually got a murmur from his. I guess they just figured we had the same thing. This was back in the 60s when I believe the only tests they had were white count. I had blood tests every 6 weeks; I guess they just stayed up and they assumed RF.

10615,"I'm a 40 yo female who has suffered from between 4-5 annual ocular migraines since the age of 21. They have always presented as a flashing moon that typically begins in the right-hand peripheral vision, and migrates to the left, progressively consuming more of my field of vision, until just kind of evaporating away. They have always followed this same pattern. Tonight I had one that was much different. It began as a full oval that covered both the right and left sides of my vision with a small clearing in the middle. This shape flashed and expanded outward, taking over pretty much all of my outer perimeters of vision, until also evaporating from the edges. I feel ok otherwise, but my eyes have a tired heavy feeling now that the visual disturbance has passed. Should I be concerned by this change in pattern? "

There is was depth in them but now they are just flat. another thing things look smaller than they really are and distances are shorter.

Keep track of your symptoms, and pay attention to what you eat as some foods can cause inflammation and pain. Research the medication and keep an open mind. I am personally anti-pills in general but have realized that I should have stayed on plaquenil longer to see if it helped.

10624,"As far as redness I would say I honestly haven't found anything that directly impacts it to a level to where I know it's my go to product. I've tried probably 15 different products in the last year and this is what my conclusions are. Avenova is a solid product that provides some instant relief but is expensive and easy to go through. Oculosoft allergy wipes (the green box) is a product I use twice a day and helps out. As far as directly targeting redness I have two products for you but they can cause some side effects like blurring (nothing to be worried about just because its oily) And those are Vaseline and coconut oil. Coconut oil was the only product I've ever used that just got rid of the feeling of my eyelid being expanded when I blinked but it was always leave my eye blurry so I only used it for a two week period. Vaseline is something I use maybe every 3 days and it's a solid product nothing to much to say about it. After continued use of everything I've gotten my eyes to a point to where I can at least live with it and more like truthfully as I write this I don't have any symptoms but I know that 5 minutes from now that could change. I don't feel like my life is just ruined. I don't know the status of your condition but lets say its at a very bad point, what would I recommend? I would say twice a day use Oculosoft allergy wipes, use Avenova twice a day, do warm eye compresses twice a day with a brudder mask, use baby shampoo in the shower (make sure you shower at least once a day), use Vaseline in the shower (and the way I do it is Vaseline first, baby shampoo second, shampoo on your hair third. If you commit to doing all of that everyday for at least a month I genuinely believe you'll notice at least some improvement, and also truthfully try buying new sheets, pillowcases, everything in your sleeping area. That's another thing my eye doctor mentioned to me. And if possible try going to an eye doctor and make sure there's nothing else going on and that will hopefully relieve some stress you may have too. "
10625,"Hey :) current Waterloo optom student here. Was sort've in the same situation as you a few years back so I'll give you my 2 cents. I would apply to both and see where you get in! Try to apply to ""Canadian friendly"" US optom schools as well as Waterloo. Waterloo is much harder to get in to, but you will find that it will definitely help you save a lot of money and future debt. You're looking at around $80k at Waterloo vs $220k at US schools in tuition across the 4 years. In terms of education, US schools may have better clinical training due to their greater scope of practice and private funding due to the high tuition rates. But Waterloo definitely prepares you well, as pass rates for the board exams is always 95% here. If you don't have the financial means for studying in the states or are financially constrained, I would recommend reapplying to Waterloo if you get rejected. But if you do have the financial means, then definitely try and interview at diff US optom schools and see how you like it there. After doing your degree there you'll get a feel for the place and may end up wanting to even stay there since salary of optoms are higher in the states. PM me if you have any more questions. Hope this helps :). "

Eye check at school sent me to an optometrist who sent me to an ophthalmologist. All they had back then was RGP lenses. No such thing as CXL or Sclearals. Graduated high school, college and got half a masters degree with RGP's. Had cornea transplants in 1980 and 1982. Cataract surgery 1998 and 1999. One was not successful. The lens implant came out of the capsule and was floating on my retina. I then had a vitrectomy to remove the lens and put another one in. This surgery caused Strabismus and over the period of a year had 4 Occlunum (botox) injections into the eye muscle. After all of this, my corneal grafts made it through just fine. I have been in glasses ever since. I retired from my occupation in 2012 and am living a normal life. All I have to do is put my glasses on just like a normal person Saw my doctor on the July 13th. My 38 and 40 year old grafts are still clear healthy and I am seeing 20/25 and20/40 in glasses. Next dr apt scheduled in a year. No, my case is not usual and grafts this old are NOT normal.

10642,"I'm a 50-year-old who's been wearing bifocals/trifocals for ten years now, and recently I switched to Ortho-K monovision at the suggestion of my opto. He gave me a contact to wear at night in my left eye for distance vision, but no contact in the right, since I can read perfectly close up without any prescription. However, the week before I got my lens I was diagnosed with vitreous detachment in my right (reading) eye, so I had floaters and a bit of blurriness in that eye before I started treatment. Lens-wise everything's been going OK, and my last appointment confirmed that the Ortho-K is working well and my left eye is healthy. However, I have not been able to see properly for the past month, and I'm worried about whether I will ever adjust to monovision at all. With my first lens, it took about ten days for my eyes to start working together properly and I had a lot of hazing in the meantime, but after 12 days I could read well and also use my laptop comfortably. However, my distance viewing was still a bit weak, so my opto increased my lens prescription (ETA: Don't know what the previous one was, but the new one is +0.50). Ten days after the switch to the new lens, I still can't read or use my laptop comfortably because of the blurring and always feel vaguely queasy. Distance vision is OK but not great. There's still a noticeably blurry patch and floaters in my right eye as well, which makes me wonder if the vitreous detachment is making it extra hard for me to adjust to monovision, or whether it's just something that is never going to work for me. Is it normal for people my age to have this much trouble adjusting to monovision? Is it possible that I could still adjust if I stick it out another week or two? Is it something that might be fixed with a different Ortho-K prescription? Or is the vitreous detachment and associated floaters/blurry patch in my right eye interfering with my ability to adjust? I have an appointment this week with my opto, but not being able to see properly is really taking a toll on me, especially as my work demands a lot of reading and laptop use. I don't want to give up too soon, but I also don't want to keep suffering like this if monovision is just not going to work for me. So I would really appreciate any input about my situation! "

10645,"I'm a 24 yo male who has had eye floaters since elementary school, however they only ever presented themselves when I looked up in the sky or at a pure white surface. They never really caused me any grief. However, in the last week I have noticed a very unusual increase in my floaters. I'm starting to see them when looking at my computer to the point its affecting my work. I am an avid computer user, and I've NEVER seen floaters when looking at my PC screen before. They've also started bothering me when I'm watching TV, and just me vision in general. Yesterday, I went to see my eye doctor and was given an OCT scan etc., to which the ophthalmologist stated my retina is very healthy, and there are no tears or detachment in either eye. I left relieved, yet disappointed and perplexed. I have been able to determine the recent troublesome floaters are coming from my right eye, this is my ''weak eye'' in terms of vision. I have had Lasik Eye Surgery, and as a result of a course of Accutane developed Meibomian gland dysfunction to which I've been doing warm eye compresses and massages. Could this have caused it? This sucks so bad, I don't understand why or how floaters just came out of the blue for no reason. They are really affecting my productivity and mental health. "
10646,"Skip to last paragraph to avoid background info I got my first pair of glasses 10 years ago after complaining of headaches, I am nearsighted. I quickly realized I didn't need them and I didn't wear glasses for 7 years, I was told there was only a slight prescription in my right eye. So three years ago the headaches return, I go to an eye place in Mexico bc that's where I was living and they gave me glasses a prescription for both eyes, .75 in the left, 1 in the right. The doc mentioned my left eye not needing correction but it would be easier for me if they corrected both so that both eyes had the same vision. I believe this doctor corrected both eyes to be 20/10, or at least that was his goal. I could see clearer so I assumed they worked yet the headaches continued for years. I went back 6 months ago (still in Mexico), trying to figure out my headaches. They tested my eyes and said that I actually has astigmatism and that I needed glasses to fix that as well as an increased prescription in my right eye. Honestly, I was confused and didn't know what questions to ask at that point. I got some glasses that were like a funhouse mirror and tried to get accustomed to them as best I could before I eventually got into an accident, totalled my car, and decided to go back to my old glasses. Now, last week I finally made it up to the US to get my eyes checked. The doc did the test over zoom and didn't allow me ask any questions about my previous prescriptions, headaches, etc. I took the test and waited while they prepped some trial contacts. With the new contacts on I took a quick test and confirmed that the contacts had left my good eye uncorrected (slightly better than 20/20) and only corrected my right eye to 20/20. So when I took the test my left eye was clearly able to see farther than the right with the new contacts on. Is this normal and OK? Previous docs seemed concerned about my eyes having the distance capabilities but this one is not? I was also told no astigmatism correction in the contacts but definitely in the glasses.. which also does not make sense to me. Unfortunately like I said there was no doc there to ask questions.

10648,Gums are always inflamed even with 3 times a day brushing/flossing. Multiple tooth loss/ cracking of teeth due to years of problems even with dental care. Familial teeth problems plus Sjogrens= shifting jaw for compensation and palate shift as well as damage to the teeth left. It took almost 10 years to get a diagnosis for Sjorgens. I was Hashimotos for many years before and treated for that but it hid the real problem for a long time. Hopefully braces + implants will finally give me some freedom back! I'm lucky enough to have been able to have a fake plate so I don't look funny but it hasn't stop my teeth and jaw from shifting. I'm in a place financially now I can hopefully fix a large majority of it.

Went to retina specialist, got dilated test done which came out okay, and also had FA and OTC done and was told the reports are within limits, but because of COVID couldn't talk to the doc himself. The next appointment is 3 days from now, and would love if someone can offer some opinion on if the tests are okay, why do i see slight waviness? Could i be imagining it, because it is the boundary area which looks slightly wavy. I have been reading online about waviness and because of young age factor, a lot of terrible genetic issues are showing (no family history of such though).

10650,"Hi Guys, hope you're well. I'm currently waiting on my Scleral Lens appointment and, if I'm being completely honest, I'm very excited. I've spent the last few months watching countless videos and reading many forums surrounding the visual benefits Scleral Lens have to offer someone who suffers from Dry Eyes or Keratoconus. I personally suffer from Keratoconus and have had my cross linking done, but prior to my diagnosis, I suffered from severe astigmatism already (-17 in my left eye and -13 in my right eye). As a result, although I was prescribed with monthly soft lens, I was advised I should wear them for upto 6-8 hours a day. Realistically I could only wear my lens for this period of time when the lens were a fresh new pair. As the month went on, I couldnt wear them for as long, despite following the correct cleaning processes. My lens would bring out the best in me and I'd feel extremely confident with them in. Therefore, you can imagine my confidence would also start to go down, as the month would go on. But from reading people's comments, it seems I should be able to wear my scleral lens up to 14-16, or even 20 hours, with no issues. As long as the scleral lens are cleaned daily and properly (and if I'm okay with cleaning them if I suffer from midday fogging) I could potentially wear them all day comfortably. I don't want to get my hopes too high, which is why I thought I'd come on Reddit and ask you guys, realistically, how many hours can you guys get out of wearing your Scleral lens for daily? And does the length of time for wear begin to reduce as the months go on? Would really appreciate your honest answers, this was I can set the correct expectations before they arrive. Thank you all! "
10651,"Got RGP lenses for the first time a few days ago so far it's been going ok I'm able to wear them a few hours a day and things look great. Except I've noticed everything is very high contrast and slightly darker? It's kinda like if I upped the contrast by 10 when editting a photo, shadows appear far darker and blocks of colours have a slightly darker tint (so it can't just be because everything is more focused?). This probably wouldn't bother me too much on the daily except I'm an Illustrator and I need to be able to see colours correctly and at the moment the difference is too noticble to work with. I haven't seen anyone mention this wonder if anyone else has had this problem? Or if its something that will go away as I get used to wearing the lenses? Thanks I know RGPs aren't a fan fav here but helped would be appreciated! "

10658,"Long story short was it was kind of a deceiving test in my opinion. That's the first time I've ever had it done. The doctor had insured me that I most likely don't have glaucoma just one of my eyes are probably normally this way meaning the vessels are a little larger in one of the eyes. I am 29 years old so I hear that older people typically get glaucoma, sorry kind of rambling. Anyhow I'm only nervous because I felt like I saw more of the dots on the sides than anything below. Unless it doesnt really form dots near your nose point of view? I felt like I was really struggling seeing any of the dots below even though my peripherals near my nose seem okay as it is so I could just be overthinking. But then again the dots seemed very very dim which was really weird to me and it was kind of hard to actually dignify when to tap. I guess I was more so expecting bright colors to a pair of my peripherals not very dim white dots Otherwise she said my eyes look healthy all around with all the other tests I took she even had dilated my eyes during my last appointment and everything looks fine.

10661,"Epi on is also only meant to be done one time. But if absolutely necessary, it can be done again. Which is a benefit of on, not a negative. It's actually as effective as epi off depending on your level of progression, but less painful. My progression was quite extreme. The ophthalmologist who did my CXL a few years ago was one of the pioneers in bringing epi off to my state in the 90s. Fast forward to 2017, when I had my procedure, and he told me that although his clinic still has the equipment to do epi off, he refuses to do the procedure on principle unless it is epi on because while epi on requires more patience, it is more effective. If a patient needed epi off because they couldn't afford epi on, then he would refer them to somebody else, but he would not do the procedure himself because it caused a patient harm that wasn't necessary and that went against his medical oath.

10662,"Hi. I'd blunt injury with a badminton eye on my right eye. Post injury i was diagnosed for the following 1. Mild Hyphema ( 0.5 mm) 2. MILD vitreous Hemorrhage 3. No retinal breaks orbdetachment 4. Traumatic Mydriasis 5. PSC Cataract , traumatic Cataract. 6. Normal IOP (18mm Hg) My VA post trauma was CF upto 3m This injury occured on 26th Jan and i was put on medication from 27. Opthalmologist prescribed me with 1. Pred Forte drops 2. Bromatidine ( Homide) drops 3. Refresh tears I followed up with my Doc every 2 days. My VA on the last follow up was 6/24 (partial)..although my vison till now is very much blurred. The problem that my Doc identified was the continuously increasing IOP. Therefore my Doc tapered the steroid and introduced IOP control drops ( brimonidine + Timolol). The drops worked initially but recent trends shows increased IOP. Therefore, I was asked to refer a glaucoma specialist and did that today. The Glaucoma specialist performed Gonioscopy today. The doc said that I have angle recession (around 270 degrees) and that Im at high risk of developing Glaucoma. My IOP today was 48 mm Hg. She said the treatment will start with medications and prescribed me the following 1. Combigan drops 2. Glycerol Syrup ( 3 times a day) 3. Iopar SR capsules. I was taken off from all other previous drops since the inflammation is reduced to some extent and that I may be a steroid responder. Although, im asked to use Nepafenac ( NSAID) for the inflammation. Il be seeing the doctor in 5 days from today. There are some questions hovering in mind rn if anyone can help with. 1. Is it possible that high IOP is due to steroids and that angle recession might not be contributing to it. 2. What are the irreveraible damages that high IOP can do? 3. How fast does High IOP may damage the optic nerve? 4. Is this high pressure contributing to my blurred vision? 5. When can you say that angle recession has caused Glaucoma? 6. Should I look out for second opinion or are there other better treatment than anove prescribed one 7. Anyother thing that i must be aware of/ self study. "
10663,"Hey! So I'm the 29 year old who literally a little less than month ago asked for advice because I was so nervous about the procedure and I even went as far as getting back into therapy because of it. I had it done yesterday and I have to say, you and I had/have nothing to worry about. It's such a breeze and if you have the right doctor they will be very accommodating because they've seen it all and heard it all. Im a bigger guy so even the positioning during the exam they made sure I was comfortable and everything. But you don't feel a thing, they numb your eye. The first 30 minutes of the exam you get to keep your eyes closed. It's the last 30 where you're clamped open looking at the light. And that's fine. The only time when it got like difficult was probably the last 5 minutes you're really fighting back the urge to blink and/or close your eyes so when you do that with the clamp in you can feel it but it's nothing bad at all. But I was cracking jokes most of the time and walked out there cracking jokes. Once the drops wore off last night my eye was really uncomfortable and it teared all night. I woke up this morning with little to no discomfort. But yeah, you'll be fine, I promise! "

10666,"It depends on the type of material more than the dk in most modern lenses. If the material was made in this century then chances are it'll be a good enough dk for your eye. Note, I said the material made in this century, not the lens. Brands like Hubble and Waldo use very old materials that came out in the 90s or earlier because they're not patented anymore and they're cheap for production. Their quality is not good for your eye though as their dk is exceptionally low. A hydrogel lens like BioTrue has a dk I believe of 48 which is good for hydrogel lenses, while 1 Day Moist is around 24 or so. Silicone hydrogel lenses tend to be more breathable and can be more comfortable for some patients. So a lens like Infuse, dailies total 1, my day, etc are all around or above 100 which is much higher than hydrogel. So in terms of lenses, I'd recommend you pick on comfort and price point. Dailies total 1 may be the most comfortable lens for most, but the cost can be prohibitive when maybe BioTrue was about the same comfort level and is nearly half the price. "

The proposed mechanism is the same as the cause of most myopia: [homeostasis of eye growth](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(04)00493-3) controlled by a retinal heuristic for the accommodation-corrected sign of defocus. But this doesn't matter. I could believe in quantum medicine by the guru of Absurdistan for all you care. Again, what's the upper bound? Pseudo-myopia caused by overworking of the accommodation system is just that- pseudo-myopia.

10668,"Hi everyone! I have been wearing contacts/glasses since I was 2, I'm 24 now. I only wear glasses currently due to dry eye. This happened to me once in 2020, and then went away after a few months. I just stopped taking a medication that I started around the time this issue originally stopped (Topamax) and I have a feeling it maybe helped my issue? For context: I have migraines, have had 5 concussions, and have idiopathic Horner's Syndrome on the right that dates back (in photos) over 7 years but wasn't diagnosed until 2020 by neuro opthamologist. So my brain is kinda wacky but I have clean MRIs. Not sure if the topamax could have been keeping the vision issues in check, but I'm not doctor. Old neurologist suspected the vision issues could be related to the Horner's/migraine but she didn't have a great answer for me. My left eye, for the past few days, is way blurrier than the right for objects more than 2 ish feet away. Vision is normal when looking at my phone, for example. . It is worse in medium/dim light and almost non-existent in bright, direct sunlight. It appears worse when the size difference between my left pupil and right are most extreme. Not sure if this could be the cause? However, I've had Horner's for years and this is relatively new. It doesn't matter if my glasses are on or off, the issue is there regardless. It's disorienting and annoying. It lasted for months last time. I feel normal otherwise. I had an exam last time this happened and things looked healthy in my eyes.

10678,"I (24f) am under a hospital for my double vision which has been going on for almost 2 years. It is diagonal binocular vision. It is mostly prevalent when looking at screens (both near and far) but can also be present when reading something that isn't on a screen. I have seen orthoptists at the hospital. I did have a squint when I was a child but it has gotten a lot better as I have got older and this problem only started when I was 22. My main problem is that the double vision varies in severity throughout the day and so something that works at the clinic may not work all the time at home. My most recent appointment I was given a 5 diopter fresnel prism to put on my glasses at an angle to try and correct the vertical and horizontal double vision. If I wear this all the time it makes me feel nauseous and usually towards the end of the day it then isn't quite strong enough. The orthoptist does not seem keen to go to a stronger prism because of my age. I have also noticed that the longer I have the prism on, the less it seems to work. Usually if I close my eyes for a bit then open them again it works better until things begin to drift again. What else can I try or do? Could it be a medical problem that causes this and would an orthoptist have known if it was something medical that caused it?)

Unlikely I completely understand don't worry at all; I went through same exact thing. Your pressures are 20-23, not 27 etc, 20 is normal and 23 would be considered hypertension; you can have high pressures without glaucoma, you have Thick Cct, which is essentially a better shield so that's a good good thing. Your specialist is completely correct, you're in the clear - if there were change you'd show it; your oct and all would be evident; a year follow up will most definitely show no changes. Your optic nerves and all look good; your RNFL so good, that's the picture of your optic nerve with the markings, mind you a tiny bit of red is pretty damn common. It's not about your RNFL and such being thin it's about if they're thinning (if you know what I'm talking about). Think the chance of glaucoma at a young age is 1/40k. 618 CCT like mine of 610 is not common at all; it's very good to have that. Glaucoma specialist see glaucoma EVERYDAY; they'd know trust me - in a heartbeat they'd know if you did or didn't or at least a hunch. I was so paranoid I even emailed and she legitimately wrote me a letter saying ""you'll be okay etc. It's just protocal to have a follow up. Remember this: your doctor said you have nothing to worry over, your pressure is slightly slightly higher than normal in only one eye, your results are all normal, ONLY goldmann matters and nothing points to glaucoma; you're not even a suspect. Even if you had 27, your results still don't hint glaucoma so same answer. From memory my pressures were 16-17 although she said my left nerve had perfect cups although showed a very very very slight thin spot (red/yellow) yet upon a year follow up - nothing changed it was either a different cause or my anatomy. It's been 4 years; nothing has changed according to my optometrist who measured the same thing in his own deevices, showing if anything becomes thinner etc or pressure lol; so maybe find yourself a solid doc who will know you personally and your case so you know they're looking at it correctly not just on the books. Funnily enough the ""thin spot in my eye isn't even where glaucoma begins lol. Sorry that's a lot but hope it helps. "

10686,"First of all, everything you are feeling is a perfectly normal reaction to a keratoconus (KC) diagnosis. Be assured it is not quite as bad as it sounds. Your son will have to make some adjustments to live with and manage his KC. Not the easiest thing for a 16 year old. But he may surprise you with how responsible he can be when he needs to be. After all, if you are willing to put him behind the wheel of an automobile, he'd better be capable of being pretty darn responsible! (BTW, driving and lack of depth perception aren't a good mix.) There are two main aspects of managing KC, stopping progression and improving vision. Ideally you stop progression with corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) and then move on to improving vision after the eye stabilizes following CXL. Unfortunately that can delay vision correction for a year or more, which may not be practical. With CXL and good management, the likelihood that things will get to the point of needing a corneal transplant are low. So don't worry about transplants for now, and hopefully ever. To give you more on point ideas, what country are you in? Is one of your son's eyes better than the other? What does he currently use for vision correction? What is his corrected vision? Did the doctors tell you how thick your son's corneas are? How confident are you in all the different diagnoses of your son's eye issues? Is it possible that some of those were a misdiagnosis of emerging KC? "

However, until then, I have two issues that I'm trying to understand: 1) When I turn my head but maintain focus on a spot (an exercise my physical therapist ordered) circles appear, one big grey one and to its right a small sunburst that looks like a pull/warp deformation from photoshop (think a circle of grey with a black hole effect). Flashes happen in this region. I have trouble focusing and my eyes twitch back and forth, so there's a lot of these exercises and, by extension, these images. 2) I'm red-green colorblind, and at night my vision seems to perceive a red LED as yellow or greenish, along with a spiky halo and a visual copy. Is this an issue with bad focusing? My colorblindness? Or could it be trauma/psychogenic? I'm so confused by this one, especially since it seems red 99% of the time. I'm a historian by trade, which means I read a lot every day. Having vision issues is bad for the brand, so to speak.

10690,"Hello everyone, I am 21F. Yesterday, I went to an Ophthalmologist. I found out that I have an Anisometropia. I wasn't aware that I have this problem in my eye. By the way, According to my medical certificate here's my exact diagnosis and plan: Anisometropia OD - 3.00 Myopia OS Plano What is the full meaning of my diagnosis? The Doctor said that my right eye has the problem. She said that there is a big gap in the vision of my eyes and she suggest to me a Lasek or contact lense. She said that eye glasses cannot be use to my eyes. I'm so worried that my eye problem could be lead in other eye problem such as Amblyopia, is it possible? I'm worried too because for now, my family cannot afford Lasek because it is pricey. So, I can't get the treatment immediately. Maybe, I will get Lasek in the future once we got the right amount of money. "
10691,"Not asking for a diagnosis, but if I have to remove this, I absolutely will. For background - I used to have glasses as a kid because of a weak right eye, but... because I was a stupid kid, I never wore them. Now I'm 22 and well, I think I need them again. Basically, 2 or so years ago, I was experiencing some problems with my eyes. So when I went to an optician, they told me that basically none of their glasses prescriptions would do any help to fix it, and left me at that. Now, my eyesight has gotten worse. I've been having problem with peripheral vision (I can only really see what's I'm focusing on, everything else is blurred out) I've phoned for an appointment for a different optician than the one I went to back in 2019, but I'm just worried I'm just wasting mine and their time by going. Because if my eyesight was too bad then, well, it being worse means glasses for sure won't work. I don't know, I'm just not expecting anything to happen when I go on Friday. "
10692,"I wear glasses most of the time. I can't see shit out of my right eye with glasses, but left is pretty serviceable. Your right, it's likely due to the graft. It's about twenty years old now, endothelial cell count is pretty low. "
10693,"At 28 years old, you shouldn't be worried about cataracts. With your prescription, you should be getting an exam every year. Not correcting your vision properly can make it worse. "
10694,Yes I was diagnosed 20? Years ago and I was told about the hard lenses instead of soft contacts I had been wearing and that if my eyes continued to get worse I'd need to go to a specialist to have a corneal transplant done. That's all there was for treatment back then. Thankfully my eyes stabilized and that wasn't necessary bc ðŸ¤¢. 
10695,I had severe migraines and was extremely sensitive to light. Severe migraine from a few minutes of exposure. Blue light glasses definitely helped some; but didn't cut it. So did night shift. FL-41 glasses were drastically more effective. 
10696,"Even if the distributor of the eye drops would not recommend mixing the two different kinds, I don't think doing it is something that would be concidered an eye injury. It is just hydration drops. Remember the last part of the exam is subjective, and the final refraction relies on your answer during the exam. The change from -1.75 to -2,25 could also be normal variety from one practitioner to another. "
10697,"Hi, I haven't been diagnosed with sjogrens, but am suspicious given I've been having bad dry eyes and mouth. Another thing I've noticed too is that if I run my tongue or finger along the inside of my bottom lip there are about 10 or so lumps I can feel inside the lip (not easily visible from the outside). The lumps are about 4mm in diameter. Does anyone know if this is normal, or a sign of swollen minor salivary glands in the lip? "
10698,"I have astigmatism and I cant see far away. My RX is different in both eyes and I wear Acuvue Oasys for Astigmatism. I recently noticed that my right eye is a bit blurry. I saw my eye doctor last week and she said it's because my astigmatism has gotten a bit worse in that eye. The problem is she said my astigmatism falls BETWEEN lenses so one would be stronger than I need while my current lens is a bit too weak. I've tried the weaker lens and the stronger lens. I can definitely tell that both make my right eye equally blurry. I've been wearing -.75 cylinder lenses. She gave me an RX for -1.25. She said I really need something in between the two. Thoughts? I REALLY don't want to give up my contacts and the blurriness isn't bad enough to where I need to give them up, but it would be great if I could find a perfect fit. Is there a brand of contacts for astigmatism that makes a cylinder that might work better for me? Strength wise I'm at -3.00. "
10699,"So I've been doing all this running around for two years trying to get a certain job, only to find that the last opthamologist i visited diagnosed me with a high myopia and increased degenerative disease (not sure if he meant glaucoma).

Well fast forward to 6 years later and I have it all that's described in this page. Difficulty driving at night, etc. I knew I have to get it checked out but the straw that broke the camels back was trying to renew my license and I failed to read anything on that little black illuminated box with my right eye. Left eye and both together are roughly 20/40. So they can't issue me an ID, I just have a permit until I see the eye doctor. Really mismanaged this one thinking it wasn't suppeerrrr serious.

10703,"I am in my 20s and am a female. Around August of 2020, I noticed that my left eyelid looked a bit enlarged (only visible from the side, and only if I close my eye and raise my eyebrow). I had just gotten some eczema there, and I didn't think much of it. December rolled around, and it was still there (I forgot about it until then, honestly). I set an appointment and ended up being referred to an ophthalmologist. We tried a steroid treatment, but that didn't work. I had a CT scan, and the only thing that he could tell on it was that the gland was subtly inflamed. All of the blood work he ordered came back normal, except for my ANA. I see a rheumatologist because I have a positive ANA, but I have not been officially diagnosed with anything. Months pass, and now, this upcoming week, I am having a biopsy done on it. A little more background information - I actually injured this eye when I was 3. I have a scar along my eyebrow, just above the gland. When I originally asked if this could be why, he brushed it off and then said ""well, it's possible. But surely if it was prolapsed that would have been visible on the CT? I also have floaters in my left eye, get awful headaches that start on that side, and tinnitus that originated in my left ear. I also see colorful static always, but it's never bothered me because I only recently found out that it's not normal. Does anyone have any ideas as to what could be going on? My WORST fear is that the biopsy doesn't give a cause. I'm also very overwhelmed thinking about the surgery, as I just had gum grafting done three weeks ago, and I'm not fully recovered. Any ideas are welcome! Thanks in advance. "
10704,"I started wearing glasses for hyperopia at 20 but can't say I ever had those issues. My prescription was +3.75 at its strongest.

No such thing as CXL or Sclerals. Graduated high school, college and got half a masters degree with RGP's. Had cornea transplants in 1980 and 1982. Cataract surgery 1998 and 1999. One was not successful. The lens implant came out of the capsule and was floating on my retina. I then had a vitrectomy to remove the lens and put another one in. This surgery caused Strabismus and over the period of a year had 4 Occlunum (a form of Botox) injections into the eye muscle. After all of this, my corneal grafts made it through just fine.

10711,"Hey what's going on everybody im new to the group and might be one of the youngest lol (21). So recently for the past week i have been experiencing a small problem with my vision in my right eye. I have a small black spot/afterimage/ sunspot that seems to appear everytime i blink. When im looking at a white wall in my bathroom and blink it pops up as a small black dot and quickly disappears. Same goes for when im staring at a bright blue sky , it's a little off to the right of my center vision. I would also like to mention when im a dim room and look at the wall and blink it's more of a small white flash and quickly disappears also. It doesn't happen with my left eye anywhere in my vision and honestly it's crippling because i deal with anxiety and anything wrong with me makes me feel as if im going blind and i wont be able to enjoy life. I do wear glasses because im nearsighted and yes i deal with floaters but i know this definitely isn't a floaters because it doesn't move. I also had a few visual auras before so i know what those are like and this definitely isnt that either... the spot does not flash at any point of time when im not blinking and it's funny because since i noticed this i have a small headache/aching behind my eye and the right side of my head but not all the time. Maybe that's all the anxiety from thinking about it too much?? I really hope it's a temp spot and not a perm spot im praying and hoping it'll all get better in the coming days/ weeks. I just started taking bilberry and lutein hoping that it'll help with the spot and upping my water intake. Oh and one more thing to mention when im staring at a bright screen and i blink when im facing a certain angle i can also see the black spot in my right eye quickly pop up and disappear Its Annoying. I do have an appointment with my optometrist tomorrow just so they can get a look. What's the longest any of you guys have dealt with a temp spot before? "
10712,"24F here, got diagnosed at 22. Blood tests came back positive, and I'd been dealing with dry eyes/mouth for about a year prior. It's honestly been very manageable, although I was very scared when I got the diagnosis. Eye drops/lubricating mouth wash help when needed. I haven't had any issues with hair/skin/teeth. I get abnormally fatigued when I'm stressed so I try to keep a very regular sleep schedule and meditate. I also have found that regularly exercising/cutting out dairy completely (not even a TINY bit of contamination) has helped a ton with symptoms (my rheumatologist said that dairy can sometimes trigger symptoms). Good luck, and I hope you find a diagnosis soon. "
10713,"Panoptix will generally give you better reading vision, with Symfony many patients need light reading glasses for dine print or extended reading sessions. Quality of vision for distance and computer should be relatively equal. The tecnis MFIOL is older and I would not recommend it. Important to understand the limitations and possibilities of glare/halos and time it could take to adapt to the new lenses. Nothing can replicate the vision of a 25 year old who can see perfectly at distance and read up close. That being said, most patients are very happy with their vision. Make sure you have appropriate expectations. "

10718,"36M, moderate myopia. My peripheral floaters are easy to ignore. But I've got this one sizable one that always settles centrally. When I move my eye it goes back to the top but always makes its way down to my central vision. Even though it's a light gray color it's very hard to ""look past""<U+009D> and ignore. Sunglasses and hats don't work for this one. My understanding is that the upper part of the eye is actually inverted and thereby showing the lower part of the eye. So they say floaters often sink thanks to gravity, but what's interesting about this one that settles centrally is that it starts out at the bottom (where I actually see it up top in my vision) then it I guess it floats up, defying gravity, to settle in my central vision. Is this floater just too light in weight to have it's settling place be at the bottom? Even though it's larger than my other ones? Can this location change over time? "
10719,"I currently have a high degree of myopia (-6.00/-6.75) and astigmatism, and have been considered as a great candidate for LASIK and PRK by a dozen of optometrists. I am decently aware of common risks and (would like to think) have a reasonable expectation of the surgery. However, I have yet to find a surgeon that provided a satisfying answer to the question in the title. From what I've searched, presbyopia and hyperopia have a different cause but a similar effect. While I have found no correlation between the two causes, it seems that having hyperopia at old age will stack with persbyopia to cause even worse vision at near sight. Anecdotally, I have found that younger age group has a lot more near-sighted folks, whereas older age group gets more far-sighted in general. While I have no statistics to back it up, it seems like people get naturally more far-sighted as they grow older. If that's the case, **I'm worried that correcting my vision via surgery now will put me at higher risk of high degree of hyperopia the later part of my life.** That sounds like I'm borrowing my good vision several decades earlier, only to suffer worse at old age. I've gotten a decent amount of testimonials from people at a relative young (20 ~ 40) age, but I haven't heard the same from the ones at older age. Are there anyone who can share some insight in that regard? "
10720,"Hello, A couple days ago I had an eye exam during my consultation for LASIK eye surgery. A part of that consultation involved pupil dilation, however the tech noted that I had higher than normal eye pressure (26). She checked with the doctor before proceeding, but ultimately gave me the eye drops with the doctor's approval. After waiting for the dilation to take effect, I noticed that my vision in my right eye seemed a bit blurrier than my left. After leaving the appointment though, I came home and noticed occasional flashes of light in the upper right quadrant of my right eye. This is day two, and I still notice those flashes. Aside from calling my optometrist in the morning, do you guys have anything to share? Could pupil dilation have caused this? Also, was my eye pressure too high for pupil dilation? Edit: Just noticed that my pupils look dilated. It's been 35 hours since the appointment and eye dilation though. Also, when I close my eyes and look in each direction, I can see the dark circle/flash fixed in the top right corner of my eye's vision. Will call the optometrist tomorrow. "

10723,"When we are younger(generally under 45ish) our eyes can accommodate, meaning that even with glasses or contacts on, the lens in your eyes can change shape when you need to see something up close, and it allows you to still see clearly up close through your contacts or glasses that are powered to correct most peoples distance vision. The ability to do this will eventually fade with age, its called Presbyopia and it happens to everyone, usually starting in your 40's. By having a glasses prescription specifically for the distance of your computer use, you alleviate the eyes need to accommodate, the muscles in your eye don't have to help the lense in your eyes change shape to stay focused on your computer, which will make viewing the computer more comfortable. The optician is speculating this will cause your eye muscles to get lazy, so that you wont be able to accommodate as well, meaning you might start having a hard time seeing up close through your normal distance glasses, and will need reading glasses(or progressive lenses) sooner that normally expected.

10727,"I am 27 years old now. When I was 3/4, I used to suffer from bone and muscles pain on my lower legs but it is gone itself. Then I began to suffer from chronic mouth ulcers (everywhere in my mouth and tongue) since 5 and keratitis (cornea inflammation) since 11. I tried all medicine (and even an eye injection) during these decades but the symptoms just come and go. My mouth ulcers become very severe in the first year of my high school and my doctors (in China) suspect it is immune system so I got injections on my lymphatic (I am not very sure which kind of medicine it is). Before I started college, someone heard of my symptoms in eye and mouth, and he suspects it is Behcet. I also found purpura on my lower legs, and been diagnosed as Henoch-Schoenlein purpura and after it is cured, it didn't come back again. I don't have arthritis or ulcers on my vagina, but it is still scary to me and my family and we realized my two symptoms are related and cannot be treated alone. Then I started 4 years Chinese medicine (for all systematic cure, you know). Ulcers are under controlled but eye symptoms go on (not as severe as in my childhood though so I just leave it there). However, I began to have acnes on my face""<U+00A6>. until now. I went to comprehensive eye examination routinely and didn't find any problem. Then I come to the U.S. I still have keratitis so I went to eye doctor routinely and take ""restasis""<U+009D> an eye drop for a few years. My eye doctor said it is cornea inflammation caused by dryness. My ulcers become much better in the first year I came here and they came back only when I was in China for summer break. Then I completely got rid of them since almost three years ago, only occasionally one came out and cured itself automatically after 10 days (drinking a lot of water will facilitate the progress). I thought everything was fine. But for a while, I got lower back pain after long-time sitting and I went to chiropractor for that. Nothing more. However, since last October, I start to have eczema on my hand (and it doesn't go away until now). My ulcers came back again soon, here and there in my mouth and tongue, one cured automatically after 10 days and the other came out right after. Simultaneously since I stopped Restasis, my eye problems became more severe and more frequent (although I never completely got rid of them) and it blurred my vision. I went to cornea consultant and he recommended me to see a rheumatologist. I went to get Moderna Vaccine last Saturday, but until now I sill feel fatigue and bone and muscle pain on my lower legs (I am not sure if it is related). Someone said I may need a rituxan treatment. I should have autoimmune disease, I used to think it is Behcet, now I feel like it is more likely Sjogrens', and since this one is much more common than Behcet, I think it has a better bet.

10728,"Hi! I'm female, in my early 30s, worn glasses for driving for about 10 years. They stayed fairly stable (mild worsening over the years). I do not wear them inside as I only need them for seeing things further away. Had my last eye test in May 2019, prescription of -1.50 on both was the result then. Had another eye test last week due to constant headaches and migraines for several weeks. The result was -0.50 on both. It has improved? I basically don't really need glasses now. The card from Specsavers says SPH -0.50, and then on left eye only CYL 0.25, AXIS 55.0 . Nothing more on the right eye. I do not really know what these numbers mean in all honesty. The optician said it could be due to unstable blood sugar - I am high risk for T2 diabetes (blood test about 5 months ago), and do have issues with food causing me to skip meals often, and have a limited diet. Was working on this with therapy but it is paused due to lockdown. I am not able to fix it without therapy, please don't give me food advice as it is not helpful at this point.

I just got the new glasses I ordered under the new prescription (3 pair) and they feel very strange. My vision in my left eye feels substantially worse than it was with my old glasses. They are the exact same frames, so I don't think that is the issue. My right eye feels about the same.

I ordered my progressive, transitions lenses with all the extras ($850 including frames) and once they arrive it's blatantly obvious that my doctor gave me the wrong prescription (I do not use my doctor's optician). Go back to doctor, get correct Rx. Go back to optician and discuss progressives vs bifocals. He convinces me progressives are better for my script. These are my current glasses and I'm still unhappy. I call optician to order replicate frames with bifocals, he tells me I must go in for specific bifocal measurements. Bifocals take 1 month to arrive.

Now, taking them out is a bit more a challenge for me although I'm getting better (had them about 3 weeks). My doctor showed the method of using your finger to push your bottom eyelid up under the lens to form a bubble. Then use the plunger to pull it out. Well, my bubble game ain't great so I often find myself with a little orange plunger attached to a lens that has too much suction to my eye! lol .... "

From experience i would suggest visiting the opthalmologist often to check up and just being very aware of your vision. Are you sensitive to light or get headaches from it? Can you see clearly with both eyes?(My right eye only has 3/10 vision left and inoticed it way too late as you can tell, because, well who stares at something with one eye closed) Any blurryness circles around lights or ghosting? If these get progressively worse that could very well be a sign. Hoped this can help you in some way. Im getting Cross Linking surgery tomorrow morning! "
10739,Yes this is certainly true. The width of the cones in the fovea can only allow for resolution of between 20/8 and 20/6 vision if I remember correctly. 
10740,"Thanks! All three glasses were made as single vision computer (intermediate) glasses. I am 52 years old, these are my first glasses ever. My close vision is not what it used to be, but I am still able to read books and kindle without eye strain. I only need glasses for hours that I spend in front of computer (which is 6 - 10 hours a day). "
10741,I've been going to the eye doctor since I was little. Today was my first appointment with a new doctor. He looked in my eye and said I had a 1/4mm cataract and that I've had it my whole life and it wouldn't get worse. Idk why I find that hard to believe as I'm 21 and no one has said anything about it before. Unless my other doctors didn't think it was an issue either. 
10742,Well I was abit negligent I was diagnosed at 14 but I didn't think anything of until I was 21. When diagnosed my vision was still 20/30 over the years it worsened to 20/200 that's when I had cross-linking to stop it getting worse. I am now 24 ( 25 next month) so I think my good eye has stabilised and my right eye is stabilised since cross-linking. I went for a check up last week and my good has eye has not changed prescription since 2012. Still 20/15 unaided. However there is some ghosting I am noticing more now but visual acuity is good. You will be fine it's likely you've had it since 15-16 ( since it starts during or post puberty ) What is your age now? Best things you could do is make sure not to rub your eyes or touch it and get some good drops. If you get cross-linking make sure your surgeon does it routinely as there are some risk. I Got some very light corneal scarring on my bad eye but it's not in my field of vision. These can be lasered off too if it's light. Also follow the advice and do the drops exactly as they say if it means you have to set a timer. I didn't do my drops properly but it will turned out well. 
10743,"At age 36 and having had keratoconus (KC) for 21 years, there is a chance that your KC has stopped progressing. While CXL is a good treatment to stop the progression of KC, you should have corneal topography that shows your KC is progressing before considering CXL. Corneal transplants are a good option for those whose vision cannot be corrected due to the damage done by KC. Only about 20% of those with untreated KC need corneal transplants. Most KC patients can get usable vision with contact lenses. If you haven't needed a corneal transplant so far, there is a good chance you never will. I don't know how things are in Scotland, but here in the US there are many ophthalmologists and most optometrists who practice in offices that are not in hospitals. Can you find an eye doctor not in a hospital if the bad memories are keeping you from having your eyes checked? It would be best to see an ophthalmologist to begin with. But once the condition of your eyes is established and a decision is made regarding CXL, you probably can go to an optometrist for vision correction with glasses or contact lenses depending on the severity of your KC and follow up exams to be sure your KC is not progressing.

The optician told me that I had developed astigmatism which was probably why my contacts were giving me trouble. I bought specs from the same optician, when they arrived, they made my vision worse-i could not see with them and everything was at a weird angle. I was advised that at my age, (46 at the time) it could take a couple of weeks for my eyes to adjust to them. A month later, my eyes still hadnt adjusted, my vision was still worse with the specs on, so I stopped wearing them. March 2018 right sph - 1.75, cyl -1.25, axis 130 left sph -1.25, cyl -0.75, axis 80 no near test done I just put it down to an incorrect assesment from the optician, so I visited another one to get a second opinion. He was very surprised at the difference and advised that I might have diabetes. I got my blood checked and this was discounted. I got some specs from this optician... same story, vision was rubbish with them, advised to stick it out and eventually gave up on them. Dec 2020 right sph +1.00, cyl -4.25, axis 110 left sph +0.25, cyl -2.75, axis 63 right sph +2.5, cyl -4.25, axis 110 left sph +1.75, cyl -2.75, axis 63 Struggled by for a couple of years, still cant see clearly, but I can get by even if i have a semi constant squint. I went to another optician and it seems my distance vision has went from a negative to a positive. I figure this might be a mistake. This optician told me that i might have something which i heard as ""Kerry Katona something something"" and referred me to the hospital, but said it might be about a year before i hear anything from them. She didnt think it was at all likely that i had this kerry Katona thing as i wasnt a 15 year old boy, but thought it was wise to get it checked. I havent ordered new glasses yet, as i am reluctant to throw more money away and I'm almost sure that if i get them filled to this prescription, they won't help me to see. I know I could probably get a refund, but I'm not very assertive and I come across as confrontational in these kind of social interactions. I also get anxious thinking that they will just blame me for giving the wrong answers during my eye test. Is there maybe something that has been overlooked in these eye tests? I'm basically constantly asked to distinguish between one blurry letter and another blurry letter, when all i can see is two different,equally blurry blurs. Maybe my eyes need a second or two longer than most people to focus? Is there some sort of way that i can determine for myself what lenses I need? If the optician stepped out, let me tinker with the lenses myself until I could actually see, then came back in and seen what I had came up with, I'm almost sure that I could get a prescription that was correct. Am I being unrealistic? Do I just have to struggle by and accept that I will never be able to see clearly? It doesnt seem to be that my vision is so bad that it's incorrectable, but what do i know? Thanks in advance. "
10746,"Hi. My optometrist measured 1.75 and 2.00 and gave me polyvinyl alcohol eye drops for dryness but my eyes cannot focus on 30 cm - 1 m range properly with contacts now. I can focus on 6 cm - 30 cm and 1m-inf ranges almost instantly. I can manually focus on 30 cm - 1 m range but I can't keep focus more than 1 seconds, it goes out of focus quickly. I don't have this problem when there is no objects in my pheriperal vision. My optometrist suggested trying glasses instead of contacts but glasses didn't change anything. Is this normal? "
10747,Don't know if it does. It is just something that has happened over the last 10 years and coincides with my deteriotating health overall. Simply an observation on my part. 
10748,"Take a look at Trivex, I think it has an index between CR-39 and Polycarbonate and also some good properties. I use to use polycarbonate. Downsides from polycarbonate is that it can be some what splitty --- my pc glasses often had problems where the metal frame joined. I can't remember but pc might have a bit higher haze too... the pros would know. It will also have higher reflectence if you don't use AR and I avoid AR generally. "

10751,So a while ago now I went to an eye doctor for some troubles I was having well I went with my mother since I'm still a minor and my. Dad had work and I drove since she can't drive. During the exam they displayed my eyes the lady thought that the drop didn't get in my left eye sos she put an extra drop which ended up making my left eye be more dialated. I wear glasses and they gave me these sun glasses things but they had not arms or nothing so I had to take my glasses off and hold them up on to my face with my hands meaning I couldn't drive with them. We sat in my car and after and hour my left eye still was dilated but my right wasn't. I waited 30 extra mins and i eventually was like screw it we have to get home some point so I put on my glasses and drove the long drive back home with my left eye dilated it was still very sensitive to light even in my car since it was super bright outside and my car is colored white so the hood was intense. So I got home it was still fully dilated and when I got inside I noticed everything had a purple tint and looked weird.m in my left eye. I noticed since that point it slowly got worse And now months later I can't see shit with my left eye. Ya think I probably fried it? 
10752,"Basic info- Female 25 35 weeks pregnant with second baby Gestational diabetes since 20 weeks. I was also diabetic in my first pregnancy which was only 10 months ago (back to back babies) metformin controlled 200 pounds and 5ft 4 inches The OBGYN I see also drew my blood yesterday and saw my iron stores were ridiculously low so I have been sent today for an iron infusion at the hospital, however I doubt this is what is causing my vision issue. So I'm hoping I can perhaps get some insight here. On Thursday of last week I woke up from a nap with a random blind spot in my right eye. It basically makes it so that pieces of a letter or word will â€˜disappear' or â€˜fade out' when I'm reading on my phone for example. The rest of my visual field and my left eye is not effected. If I am looking at an object from a distance, such as a games controller, part of the controller will disappear before coming back into focus. In only one part of my eye. It is totally weird and terrifying. I have suffered ocular (eye) migraines in the past but this is not one of those. It has not gone away or faded in nearly a week. I realised the importance of getting this managed so contacted an eye doctor right away. I have very very poor eyesight anyway with a very strong prescription so I know how quickly eye problems should be looked into. She saw me a couple of days later and found nothing wrong with my eye at all. She even did specialist eye scans and nothing flagged up. The only thing she noted was that I had more eye floaters in the effected eye so her theory was that my vision loss was due to eye floaters. I was sent on my way with no further follow up. By yesterday (Monday) I was still no better. I was seeing my OBGYN for a growth scan and check up for the baby and mentioned my eye issues as the nurse was taking my blood pressure. Blood pressure came back fine. The OBGYN didn't really know what to do or say which I expected as she doesn't specialise in eyes but I figured if I mentioned it she could maybe direct me further for help. Instead she determined my blood sugar control was â€˜probably bad' and that could be why my eyes were acting funny. However the eye doctor tested me for diabetic retinopathy days before and this came up negative. The OBGYN has said she will decide on Friday if I need insulin after reviewing my blood sugars and adding another dose of metformin. I feel I have been really pushed off here and I don't know where else to turn. My grandad died of a brain tumour and I truly believe I have one too now on account the eye doctor found NOTHING amiss with my eye at all. I'm terrified and so upset. I live in the Uk so we can't simply just shop around for doctors. Our health care is limited due to it being free therefore I can't just contact a random eye doctor for a second or third opinion. I can't just get myself a neurologist. Everything has to be done through referrals and nobody is referring me anywhere. Has anyone got any input at all? Please? Thanks. "
10753,How long have you been diagnosed with KC ? Are you over the age of 30? 
10754,"It has been a rough year for me. I failed part 1 twice, part 2 twice, and part 3 once.

10755,"I would say this: focus on your symptoms and how debilitating they are. Be detailed and thorough when explaining your symptoms. find that doctors can sometimes take you less seriously if the conversation overflows with your own interpretation and suspicions about your symptoms, which is terrible, but we all know that sometimes doctors can be .... not great. I'm 24, F, so Im conscious of doctors taking me less seriously. I always use my best ""Confident, mature, knowledgeable, calm""<U+009D> voice when speaking to them.

10756,"You are way more concerned about this than you should be. Remember- the genetics argument doesn't necessarily mean you inherited the gene. Mutations happen all the time. The important thing is that you are still correctable to 20/20. You definitely do not have malignant myopia. There's no point in worrying about a -0.25 diopter change. Most of the patients I see have small changes in their Rx throughout their lives. In the next 10-20 years, the index of refraction of your lens is going to decrease and your prescription will improve. Then you'll get cataracts and your prescription may start to increase again. The change in your Rx has very little to do with the actual state of health of your eyes. "

My eyelids are burning mostly and this is where the biggest irritation is. I don't know if this is caused from the excessive water use in my eye thinking that water can help, but water relieves for some time and later my eyes become more dry! Also I scratched them often lately and I thing that they are irritated now because of that. Normally arent like this. Anyway I wanted to try something that maybe can help my problem for these days. Should I go for refresh pm(oilment) or gel teal(drops)? Which is better for a mild dry and burning eye? Also I don't want my eye to stop producing these ingredients(if that's a thing in ophthalmology). Should I go for oilment or drops?

10762,"Here is my story. I always share it with newly diagnosed people. Mine progressed fairly quickly but everyone is different. Trust your doctor :) As someone who has won the battle with Keratoconus, I like to answer all of our newly diagnosed people with this message :) -First of all, do not panic. KC does NOT mean the end of your eyesight or your world. You are now embarking on a journey, a KC journey. I was diagnosed in 1968 and 1970 when there was no such thing as CXL, Sclerals and transplant procedures were primitive. I had successful transplants (1980, 1982) and I am now in glasses 20/25 and 20/40.. My advice to you is: 1. Not panic 2. Find a doctor and lens fitter that you trust. It's YOUR eyesight. Get a 2nd opinion if you need it. 3. Follow his/her instructions 4. If you have ANY problems or concerns, contact them. Even when it is after clinic hours, there is always someone on call to help. Yes, you have support online, something I didn't have in my day; however, run everything you read online by your doctor before any treatment; even advice from me :) There are so many great treatments today. The chances of needing transplants are much slimmer than in my day. You should do fine. Most get relief by CXL and Scleral lenses. I hope this calms your fears a bit :) \*\*\*\*\*Update,\*\*\*\*\*\* July, 2021 Saw my doctor on the 26th.. 39 and 41-year-old grafts are still clear and healthy.

My right eye always feel tired, especially when reading books, where I feel exhausted instantly I read, which is ruining my life. My eye doctor did not spot any infection or dry eye, which makes me wonder what it can be. Preservative free eye drops do not make me feel better, even right after I apply it. Hylo dual intense, extremely high quality. My right eye, which has the pain, seems to have a redder tear duct, but how can this be true when the opthamologist did not see any infection? The pain feels like it is more towards the lower eyelid, from near the inner corner to the outer corner. The outer corner seems to leak a clear white substance, unlike those inner eye boogers you get. The opthalmologist did not find it special. The eye looks watery in the morning, but not leaking watery. I just clearly see the eye either lacking water or being more watery? Left eye looks normal. Pulling down the lower eyelid feels more uncomfortable on that eye than my normal one. Dry eye - Surely it is not dry eye if only one is hurting? Nearsighted - I doubt it is just normal eye strain, as I can feel it at all times, even full days without reading. Lagopthalmos - is this something the eye doctors care about or can tell during the test? I cannot close the painful eye alone, it only goes half closed. But I do not feel better, even with night time ointment Vita pos. Eyelashes stuck - I frequently have eyelashes stuck in the eye. Convergence Insufficiency - I am undergoing vision therapy for that eye, but in the past the convergence strain was only felt while reading books. The current pain feels much worse. Allergy - I have mite allergy and birch allergy. I am completely lost and grateful for any help.

Vitamin A, C E, and the mineral zinc contain antioxidants that help in preventing macular degeneration. (It's a condition in which macula deteriorates). 2. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids such as flaxseed and salmon are also great for better eye health. 3. Exercising regularly and maintaining your healthy weight helps in maintaining your vision correctly. 4. Protect your eyes from the sun by wearing quality sunglasses, even on cloudy days. 5. While working on the system, rest your eyes by taking a break every 20 minutes. 6. If you wear contacts, always wash your hands before putting your lenses. 7. Avoid smoking as it increases the risk of developing age-related eye diseases. 8. Keep visiting the doctor for your vision test. 9. Throw away your old makeup as it might lead to developing eye infections 10. Get regular eye screenings to review your health and family history of the eye disease. "
10776,"I just wanted to write this post for anyone going through this or to prevent anyone from getting it! Im healed now! But lets rewind back. I wore contacts ALL day and sometimes would accidentally sleep with them on. I did this alot and never had a problem for years. Until 11/5/21. I had this weird feeling in my eye like something was in it. I took out the contacts and that feeling was still there! I looked in the mirror to see if anything was there. I then got a flashlight and there I saw a white dot on the brown part of my eye! After googling, my eye matched the picture of a corneal ulcer. So I called my eye doctor the next morning. It was so hard to sleep that night. My eye was so sensitive to light it kept watering. And it felt so uncomfortable like I had a pebble stuck in my eye. My eye dr confirmed it indeed was a corneal ulcer. Luckily it was a mild case. From overwearing contacts. Eye got dry and there was built up bacteria. My treatment included prescription drops and follow up every few days (i saw my eye dr 4 times in less than 2 weeks). 11/6-11/7 I was taking antibiotic drops Cipro. 11/8-11/17 antibitoic steroid drops Tobramycin. The healing process was slow and I was worried I would never make progress. But I followed my treatment plan. My eye is no longer sensitive to light, no more pain. My eye doctor has given me the okay to wear contacts again as long as Im smarter about them. But this experience has definitely shaken me up. Glasses it is forever! So if I can prevent anyone else from going through this, dont sleep with contacts on! If youre going to wear them all day give your eyes a rest at night and wear glasses.

Also I remember being told as a child that I had a lazy eye (neither of my eyes ""wander""<U+009D>) which I didn't get diagnosed with this eye test. At first I thought ""lazy eye""<U+009D> was just a common way to describe astigmatism to the laymen, but they are different conditions. Can astigmatism develop later? Can lazy eyes repair themselves? "
10779,"I have astigmatism. I have toric lenses that were put in to correct for that issue. I still use glasses and my vision continues to require prescription changes about every two years to get 20 20 with glasses. I am 74 so probably the decline in sight is age-related. Sorry, I do not recall what grade of cataracts or if I even paid attention to that aspect at the time. I can tell you I was having considerable vision problems (like just watching TV as well as driving a car) that cleared up totally after the cataract operations. "
10780,"AGE: 18 GENDER: Male Farsighted Hi, i recently started to experience flashes and flickering dark/brown/yellow spots in my vision. Most of the flashes are very small and for a few miliseconds but some of them are big and has a blueish tint to them. It's been over a week but it never goes away. Also they are happening oftenly. I always had floaters, they aren't new for me. Now the problem is, my parents don't have insurance. I experienced Conjuctivis before and they waited for 2 months to let me see a doctor. I was in pain and my eyes were in a devilish red color for those 2 months. Now i'm pretty sure they will think that i'm making up my sypmtoms and being over anxious. I'm really worried, should i beg to my parents to let me see a doctor for this? "
10781,I mean.... yes. I've been wearing glasses since I was 10. 
10782,"Diagnosed at 30, now 32. Luckily I have had minimal issues so far. The occasional swollen salivary glands and dry mouth.. and the annoyance of extra dr visits and blood work. I felt like it was a death sentence when I first found out. I worried I wouldn't be able to keep up my active lifestyle or live a full life. I started hobbies I had always wanted to try and try hard to stay active to hopefully keep myself in the best shape for the longest time I can. It has made me appreciate the active life I have now, I know as I get older it may and probably will get harder to keep up with. The best advice I can give is to enjoy today and try not to worry about what may be in the future. Some people progress very slowly. I would join a fb group for sjogrens, it has put me in contact with a lot of lovely ladies and provided a broad idea of what may or may not occur for someone with sjogrens. "
10783,"Does anyone else experience this? If so, do you know why? I'm trying to discern whether this is a sign that I'm reacting negatively to these foods and should not consume them, or if it's a common and irrelevant Sjogrens thing. It happens within 15 minutes of finishing a meal. "
10784,I'm a 23 year old male who has had strabismus from childhood. I went to an ophthalmologist to get an idea about potentially getting surgery to align my eyes back into normal position. I have a 30 degree inward turn on my right eye I'd like to fix. My doctor did a few tests and told me that she recommends a 20 degree fix in order to avoid double vision. Would aligning the eye completely cause me to have permanent double vision? Or will my brain get used to the new alignment of the eyes eventually? 
10785,"I have a history of retina tear that I got when I was 13 years old (which is 12 years ago, as I'm 25 now). I have high myopia, and an eye doctor also let me know there are areas of my retina that are weak & thin. I also have floaters. Recently, I noticed occasional peripheral small white dot flashes. They usually happen so quickly and throw me off. They don't occur in a row but sporadically throughout a day, differing in number too (e.g., it was about 6 times the day before yesterday, and about 2 times yesterday). I went to see a retina specialist 2 weeks ago. The doctor said everything is okay and that my eye is healthy. When I inquired him about PVD, he said that may have been the cause of my flashes. The flashes keep happening occasionally after the last appointment with him, and I cannot help feeling anxious. It's not realistic either to meet with an eye doctor every two weeks when flashes don't subside or if they increase in number slightly. I've met so many optometrists and two ophthalmologists since last year, and they all told me there's no sign of retina tear/detachment (just thin patches of retina due to my myopathy). I am not sure what signs to look out for to see if I'm indeed getting a retina tear/detachment, not just another PVD or retina tugging. My biggest fear is brushing off the actual signs of retina tear/detachment as ""it's another PVD. I've had this before,"" not going to ER, and risking my vision. How long would it take for a retina tear or detachment to develop after the eye doctor or optometrist does the fundus dilation exam and says everything is fine? Advice would be much appreciated! "

10792,It's more red than in the picture it's not necessarily red veins more like a red blotch. It's not painful and I just noticed it today it wasn't there yesterday. I am currently wearing contacts but 90% of the time for the past month I've been wearing my glasses a lot more because of the eye problems. I wear the Bausch and Lomb ultra astigmatism contacts when I do wear them. I've been having a problem with my left eye recently where it's slightly elevated pressure but my eye dr thinks it was because I was using prednisone drops and it raised the pressure or it could be allergies. I'm really scared about my eyes because I've never had problems with them beside having to wear contacts and glasses! Help! I'm only 27 so I really don't want to go blind. And my eye dr said I'm probably not gonna go blind but I'm just scared since it's my eyes you know. Should I call my eye drs after hours hotline about this and see what they recommend? or wait till Monday. 
10793,"I've been using Refresh Celluvisc preservative free or another brand (also preservative free) for more than 40 years at my ophthalmologist's and optometrist's direction to treat my dry eye condition. I use them far more than 4 times a day. I've always been told to use them as many times as needed. If you encounter inflammation and discomfort using the brand you are using, it's probably an allergy to the preservative in them and switching to preservative free will solve that problem. "

Admittedly I don't know which part you're from though! "
10795,"I had a set of RGP lenses 10 years ago, last checked about 4 years ago and found to be in good condition but Rx changed a little. After years of mostly just wearing glasses, I want to get a new pair of RGPs. However, I'm finding it hard. My original pair I got via a high street optician. This time around I'm getting them via my local NHS hospital as I have a complex prescription that qualifies me to do this (didnt know this before). Unfortunately, the ones they've given me (after trying a few) just aren't working. The problem is, though, they should work on paper. Apparently I'm seeing well on the sight test and the fit is perfect. But when I'm out in the real world, the vision to me just isn't good and they don't feel comfortable. I've been back for many appointments and the patient optician has looked at the fit and tried adding more or less power, and just found the same thing over and over: good fit, good vision. So I don't think they can see a problem. Any theories as to what could be the problem? Out of frustration today, I actually put in my old contact lenses (I know, not supposed to do this) and the vision and fit feel so much better. I can tell it's not perfect as the Rx has changed, but I don't think it's too far off and somehow everything just feels sharper. "

10797,"Hello all, so I have been in diagnosis limbo for almost a year now and no one can seem to figure out what I have. Bloodwork has shown a positive ANA (speckled), positive for SP1 antibodies IGG, IGA, positive for PSP antibodies, and then other random ones that are nonspecific. The range is below 20 for negative and I was in the 60s for all of them. My old rheumatologist brushed me off because I tested negative for SSA/SSB (Ro or La) antibodies, even though these other indicators of sjogrens are so high. Has anyone else been tested for SP and PSP? I am waiting on more extensive bloodwork from a *new* rheumatologist who suspects it could be SS, but I am just so tired of how long it has been taking to figure this out, on top of being in college and unable to function anymore. My symptoms include extreme fatigue, dry mouth, nausea, dry heaving, joint pain, dizziness, brain fog, numbness & tingling in extremities. I have a little bit of dry eye and strain but not even close to as severe as everyone else I see who has sjogrens. Just wondering if anyone has any similar symptoms- especially the fatigue, nausea and dizziness, and took forever to get diagnosed. Also have been given methylprednisolone from the rheumatologist to try out and see if it makes me feel better, do any of you have success from this medication? Not looking for medical advice, just feeling very alone in all of this and wondering if anyone had a similar experience. "
10798,"So I was wondering about the progression of KC, I know it varies from case to case but I am pretty concerned.

10799,"Hi all. A bit of background. My 9 yr old son was born with bilateral micropthalmia. He has no vision in either eye and has been wearing prosthetics since birth. He will soon be undergoing enucleation of one eye and will have dermis fat graft placed during the same procedure. We have a consultation with his surgeon and opthalmologist in a few days and this is an opportunity for us to ask any questions before his surgery. So basically, what questions should I be asking? We've had the procedure explained to us, and we're across the basics but I don't know what I don't know. For example we were under the impression that it would just be a day procedure and that he'd be discharged with pain medication on the same day. Our ocularist however told us that they typically keep children in hospital overnight after such a procedure. We will check this with the surgeon but we wouldn't have known this if the ocularist didn't mention it. What else should I be asking about e.g. fat graft vs acrylic implant vs other options? Pain relief options? Complications or prospects for the future 10 or 20 years down the line with technological advances? Anything else that comes to mind? I'd like to be as informed as possible. I'll also post this in r/eyetriage and maybe a more general medical sub to get as much exposure as possible. Would this post be allowed at r/opthalmology? Sorry for the long post but all responses are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. "
10800,"So I've been seeing flashes of light in my vision periodically (more frequently when I'm lying in bed at night) and I sometimes see a shadowy spot in the middle of my vision that moves with my eye, as if something is floating inside my eye. I googled all these and came to the conclusion that it must be posterior vitreous detachment, but its very unlikely to happen if you are under 30 and I'm only 19. What do you think this means? I can't go to the optometrist because of covid19. "
10801,"I hate to wear glasses or contact lenses. I dont know where my astigmatism came from Cuz i never had surgery on my eye, damaged it that i know off. It could be hereditary but it came on suddenly and I usually had amazing eyesight. Just feel angry n Sad at myself that my eyes r screwed n will only get worse from now on onward to old age. I want lasik but its not severe enough just Annoying asf when out seeing light rays distorted vision. Adds to my depression n im only 20. I do watch computer screens alot. They say it isnt caused by it but i think its a scam cuz if they where to say it does then market for tech could suffer. Wht u think? N do u know any natural fixes. "
10802,"Same age you were when I had mine, and it was the right eye as well. I was told my donor was young so it might last longer. Recovery was fine, I kept being warned there might be pain but the worst pain was the shot they gave me before the operation (not sure how typical this is). I took 3 weeks off work. The weirdest thing was the day after my surgery they had me come in to take the bandage of and the doctor to look at it and my good eye was trying to close, like physically, I had to hold it open with my hand. The doctor said that is normal and how your eyes work together caused it to happen. Once the bandage was off things were fine. I know it took a week or so to get past the meat of the recovery but the difference was noticeable nearly right away. Now I think I only ever got 20/40 in this eye, and need to get a contact to get 20/20 but compared to before it is night and day. I am very glad I had it. I have had allergies and I used to fear my good eye itching when driving because I couldn't drive with just my bad eye but now (even without a contact) I can. Honestly I stressed the surgery so much and it really wasn't that bad. I was awake but they doped me up so I was awake but not super aware if that makes sense. "
10803,"I'm not looking for a diagnosis, I'm just wondering if this is normal for eye health? I'm a mid 20's man with no known eye health issues. When I wake up in a dark room, I see almost 100's of tiny dark spots for about 30 seconds and then they go away. Does this sound normal? "

10806,"I've been reading through many of the threads here, and I first just want to say, I'm sorry for the discomfort so many of you seem to be living with. It sucks, and I hope more complete treatment/cures are discovered soon! Question: if you use drops to add moisture, what do you typically use, and what is your experience with it? I was told I have dry eyes about 20 yrs ago, by an ophthalmologist who explained this was why I could not wear contacts comfortably. He advised drops. He did not explain what ""dry eyes meant, in this context, so I went on my merry way, wearing eyeglasses rather than contacts, and not using any drops (because my eyes felt fine, and I just didn't get why I would put stuff in them when they felt fine so long as I didn't put lenses in them). In recent years, I've been having a lot of dry discomfort and blurry vision when I wake in the middle of the night, to the point that I just cannot have my eyes open. This is a pain, because I am typically awake for at least an hour every night, often for several hours, and sometimes it helps to sit up and do some writing/reading to discharge thought patterns that will otherwise cycle and keep me awake longer. It's not the worst thing in the world to not be able to do this, but it does add to the overall stress. So, the other day, I finally decided to try out that ophthalmologist's advice and I bought a box of Thera Tears nighttime eyedrop one-use vials. I put some in my eyes an hour or so ago, and what an unpleasant experience that has been! I swear my eyes felt more dry, even as they were shedding liquid I had to mop with a kleenex. They've felt irritated since, and my vision keeps blurring up to the point that I can't see at all. Is this a normal experience with eye moisturizing drops? Did I maybe make a mistake in using these? The other question I have is about my relatively new iPad Air. I noticed right out of the box that the light from the screen felt super harsh to my eyes, as if it were practically cooking them. I nearly sent it back immediately, but need to be able to use it for practical reasons. I try to keep it at least arms length from me, I turn on the blue light filter, especially at night, and keep the brightness very low constantly. Has anyone else noticed a difference with the newer model iPads? I had an old iPad 3 or 4 before this iPad Air, and never noticed this feeling of being sort of microwaved by the screen. My eyes feel odd after using it for an hour or more. Any suggestions on how to minimize potential harm? Would I be better off with a laptop? I would love to go back to the days when I didn't need a screen device, but that's just not practicable these days... "
10807,"Thank you! And yes, taking care of my 60 year old eyes! after healing, planning on cataracts next summer. "
10808,"I'm just curious about some other reactions. I went to the eye doctor yesterday, and for the last 2 years they have been monitoring my pressure. It used to be 16/17 except, the last few years, it has been consistently 19/20/21 each time I have it checked. I have taken the field of vision test and that turned out fine. I also got my optic nerve examined via dilation and the eye doctor just looking visually at my optic nerves post dilation. He said it looked great/clear/no damage. HOWEVER, due to the slightly high eye pressures, I was glaucoma suspect and they gave me an OCT test. I am 37/female. My OCT came back full green for the right eye, but it there was a yellow segment and a red segment at the 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions, respectively. I haven't been experiencing any vision loss or problems, but my left eye does feel a bit sore sometimes because I get a lot of mild migraines. I also have a borderline thyroid that is literally right on the cusp of being hyper. And I have moderate myopia and high astigmatism in that left eye. All of these things considered, any thoughts? I am going to second eye doctor next week and wanted any feedback on what maybe I might talk about with them, as well as general impressions on my situation. Not taking any meds yet but I am being aggressively watched and re-tested. Thanks! "
10809,"I have never had thyroid eye disease. The eye pressure reduces to about 22 in both eyes when I use the eye drops and the doctor advises to discontinue and check the pressure again in about 3-6 months. The flashes happen only at night and with eyes closed. It's sudden (lighting flash like I guess) and I would shudder and immediately open and it would be gone. The flash appear again on some days. On average, the flash occurs about thrice a week. I also realised today that I've more floaters in my eyes than usual. It only appears when I'm not wearing glasses and look at bright light or sky. I always wear glasses, so it's not bothersome. My family has been discarding my concerns about the floaters and flashes saying it's in my head. I've been in a lot of stress in the past few months so I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it though I feel that the flashes are a little scary, I've never experienced anything like that before. I don't trust my family, they always disregard my concerns regarding health, the first time I wore glasses (at age 12) my prescription was -3.0 D myopia in both eyes that even the doctor was surprised that I didn't have it checked out earlier. I can't visit a doctor in 2 months so I'm asking you. "
10810,"Not looking for a diagnosis, just a bit of help. Do I need to buy new glasses? I saw an ophthalmologist in 2019 who noted that I had mild astigmatism in my right eye. I think this is the first time astigmatism was noticed by anyone (have had poor vision for 16 years, since age 16). (Rx attached as Doctor One) I just barely got vision insurance in December and wanted to use my annual allotment before the end of the year. The only doctor who could see me in time was at a chain that was inside an eyeglasses store. No biggie. I saw him on December 15 and he told me that my old doctor was overprescribing and made a change in my prescription. He noted no astigmatism in my right eye, but rather my left. (Rx attached as Doctor Two) I bought two pairs of glasses and have been experiencing headaches, dizziness, and vertigo since January. I searched my symptoms online and learned that this is pretty normal and to be expected with new glasses. From what I read, the adjustment period shouldn't take much longer than two weeks. After it didn't clear up, I started to worry that something was wrong. I had the optician adjust and fit my glasses twice. I visited a podiatrist for custom insoles and had a chiropractor adjust my neck hoping this would help and tried not to worry that my next appointment would be with a doctor at an urgent care (I don't have a family doc). Finally, my husband suggested that I go back and have my eyes looked at again. I saw another optometrist at the same chain I'd been to in December (Rx attached as Doctor 3). He gave me a new prescription which noted astigmatism in my right eye and none in my left ""<U+0080><U+009C> just like the ophthalmologist in 2019. Did the doctor I saw in December make a mistake? Could wearing glasses with the wrong correction for astigmatism cause my issues? Can it damage my eyes? Also, looking at the prescriptions, I can see that my astigmatism has gotten worse. Is it progressing at normal or a worrying rate? Anything I can do help alleviate or stop the progression? Thank you!! Edit: typos. "
10811,"Ophthalmologist here. First, a small but important comment regarding terminology. By definition, **age**\-related macular degeneration (ARMD, or AMD) occurs in individuals 50 and over. To my knowledge, there is no recognized diagnostic entity known as 'early-onset ARMD.' Now, there *are* a number of macular diseases that can affect younger adults (and kids, for that matter). The most common is *Stargardt disease*. (Stargardt's was formerly known as 'juvenile macular dystrophy,' but this term has fallen from favor.) By dint of its clinical presentation, Stargart's is not really a degeneration per se, but it is sometimes referred to as such in literature intended for a lay audience. Further, while Stargardt and ARMD share a critical disease feature (loss of RPE cells), the pathophysiology of the two diseases--ie, the series of events that lead to RPE death--are completely different. Finally. Based on everything you have said, I see no reason to suspect you have Stargardt's (or any even rarer macular condition). You qualify (barely) as having high myopia. High myopes have an increased risk of retinal holes. Some retinal holes carry a risk of retinal detachment, and are lasered as a precaution. Per your report, that is the extent of your significant ophthalmic findings. So why are you seeing spots? One answer is *entoptic phenomena*. If we look hard enough (by which I mean focus our attention), people can see all sorts of things that represent normal events within the eye, eg, white blood cells passing through the vasculature; floaters; ghost images caused by astigmatism; etc. These are there all the time for everyone, but we learn to ignore them. One thing that commonly causes people to stop ignoring and start noticing entoptic phenomena is *health anxiety*. Health anxiety is often triggered by receiving worrisome health-related news--for example, if one were told they had retinal holes and needed laser, this could trigger health anxiety. I suggest you explore this possibility with an appropriate healthcare provider. "
10812,"Hey everyone! I have some questions about a condition i was diagnosed with today: optic nerve head drusen. Some background: I'm a 22 year old female. I got referred to an ophthalmologist after going to the ER for some spots in my vision and shimmering lights in my peripheral. During the exam my ophthalmologist saw I had bilateral optic nerve swelling. I had an MRI and several other tests done by a neuro ophthalmologist which ruled it down to drusen building up on both nerves. My questions are: Is there anything that can be done about it (treatments or surgeries)?How badly will this affect my vision over time? How long would it take to progress? And is there any preventative measures I can do to prevent more build up? Quite honestly, I am scared. My doctors did very little to inform me of my condition before sending me home (it was a 2 hour flight and weekend stay before I got to see them). I would appreciate any answers I get, thank you! "

I am super excited because I expect my vision to be awesome in them. After all I have been through; surely Medicare should call my lenses a ""medical necessity and pay for them. 1500.00 is really cheap for the fitting and lenses.

10817,I had it done at about noon and am feeling the effects of recovery. I had a mild case of Keratoconus in my right eye that was caught early and I just went through the procedure. It cost \~$500 and was very easy to do. I sat in a chair for about an hour while they put drops in my eyes and was only under the light for about 5-10 minutes. I was under the impression that I would not be able to see \*at all\* with my right eye for a while but it actually isn't so bad. Is this because my case is mild? I would have honestly been able to drive home; that's how non-affected my vision was. I only experienced a little blurriness in my right eye and the pain is at a 2/10- only a slight burning sensation. We will see if it gets worse. For those reading horror stories on here about the procedure: do not fret! It is not as bad as you think. I looked up so many scary youtube videos (legit looked like something out of the videogame Dead Space) before doing it that psyched me out and in reality it was very tolerable. Maybe once my pain medicine wears off I will experience some bad pain but I will keep you guys updated :P For now I have to put drops in my eyes and wear some pretty hefty glasses for a couple days. Thanks for reading.

The fact that she didn't have a look with her slit lamp is completely potato. Again we are random people on the internet so please treat the info as such. But in terms of woodworking, it's better to check twice and cut once. You don't have to do something you may regret or don't have a full picture of. All the best. "

I'm worried if i've dried my eyes because of this and caused the floaters? "
10821,I did it at 20. Get a second opinion fast. 
10822,"Im 17M and I had no problems with my eyes ever since I was born. I didn't wear glasses nor had any issues with my vision at all. Recently I notices some floating dots in my vision and they are transparent, move around kinda fast and visible on brighter lights like sky or near the light bulbs, white screen or paper... Sometimes I may see some floating rings too that fall. I spend my time using my computer and I do it since I was a child because games, developing/programming and all that fun stuff u do on computers is my passion and I enjoy it a lot. What can be the cause? My eyes are also kinda red lately and I think that's because they are dry because of my sleep patterns with all the pandemics going on and also using the computer and phone during the day because there is nothing else I can do. I think I noticed floaters before my eyes became red but it still doesn't close the fact that floaters may be caused by dry eyes. Can anyone tell me what's going on and maybe help me think of something because im pretty sure that they wont disappear and my research just keeps making this fact true. My eyes are also kinda bright blue and Im telling this just so I can spit out more details. You can ask me something as well I just want to know why I got them at such a young age. "
10823,Feeling some anxiety about impending cataract surgery. Sixty+ years old with poor night vision and poorly corrected sight for decades. Plan is for Vivity in both eyes with surgeries one month apart. Second eye has astigmatism. There are a slew of discouraging posts about Vivity here. Was glad to find this recently. Anyone have some encouraging words about Vivity?[Vivity review from Healio.com](https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20210818/blog-a-presbyopiacorrecting-lens-for-nearly-every-eye). 
10824,"Without lenses I have 6/30 and 3/60 and with them I have 6/6 and 6/18. I can wear my lenses for up to 20h, which means no disco and no very late parties unless its in my home. Wearing lenses could have meant that I would have to change hobbies as I couldn't do stuff were I could loose a lense, but I wear swimming pool goggles in order to keep doing what I please. I also wear them outside when it's windy. I get teased and odd looks but I'd rather not loose my lenses and not get stuff into my eyes. Backpacking is also out of consideration and I always need to have small size eye care to keep with me on the plane (the air is so dry). KC sucks, but the good things are that it made me more compassionate with others, more resilient and more willing to rely on and trust others. So I feel that it benefited me. My biggest worry with KC is to pass it to my kids as this is clearly in my family tree (great uncle and cousin also have it, not my brothers though). Overall, I can see, so I'm thankful not to be blind or to have anything worse than poor eyesight and I'm glad KC made me a better person, although I whish I'd be that person without KC. "
10825,"I've had irritation on the outer corner of my eyes for years. Other than that, my eyes look pretty normal. Eye Doctor recently diagnosed as dry eye, I'm suspecting this is due to smoking or lack of sleep... Also on the computer all day for work. She also said I have a very mild case of blepharitis, but she hesitated to tell me because she said it was so mild. I have no routine. I only use the eye drops she recommended. Also, as you can see, I have a clogged pore on my lash line. I'm terrified now that she told me I have mild blepharitis. I don't want it to get worse. Before getting the clogged pore on my lash line, I wore makeup rather regularly. Always removed it though. Can I not wear makeup anymore? I'm so scared... I'm only 21 and I don't know how I will live with this condition... I don't want it to get any worse... I thought my eyes looked okay. "
10826,I'm only 27 but on my yearly eye exam I just found out the last 4 years my eye pressures have been 18-20 even in the middle of the day. I'm just worried because I've read people being put on watch lists for pressures at 18 alone before. They used the I care device.. from what I've read that tends to overestimate a couple points sometimes? 
10827,"I am really scared and need help. I had trabeculectomy in my right eye one week ago. I was hoping the blurry vision gets better after one week, but my vision is still very blurry. How long did yours take to get better? I also suffer very high pressure in my left eye (37). It is super sensitive to light, and feel its vision getting worse. How long should I wait until do trabeculectomy in this eye? "
10828,"Hello, From your response to my question, your visual disturbances did not resolve upon looking through a pinhole. Now, I'm not thinking of a neurological condition just yet. Since you are 40, you have an increased chance of cataracts or otherwise clouding of the ocular media. Retinal causes can be to blame as well. One question: Do you, or anyone in your family, suffer from diabetes, hypertension, cataracts, retinal or macular problems? "
10829,"Yeah, very unlikely a degressive lens is what you need. There's will be some distortion to the sides of the lens which will make working on multiple screens difficult. I would use a degressive for a 55+ year old who needs to see at multiple distances (eg paper work at 45cm, screen at 70cm) and they need to quickly switch between the two. Usually office workers but I'll use it sometimes with hairdressers etc. At 27 you will be able to see clearly at a variety of distances without special lenses. I use ""anti fatigue"" lenses sometimes for digital eyestrain but they don't really add any benefit to computer users. They are more useful for frequent phone users, readers or anything that is held close and far below eye level. Most likely you need to be taking more breaks. You might have something going on with your binocular vision (how your eyes work together), or you need to update your glasses, or you have dry eyes. But I wouldn't bother with a degressive at your age, way more downsides than upsides. "
10830,"Looking for some advice, hope this post is aloud. Sorry about the formatting, on mobile. This is a long story so I'll try to be as brief as possible. I (27F) was diagnosed with a detached retina 7 years ago. I was told my case was more complicated as I had scar tissue built up within my eye. I ended up needing multiple surgeries including a scleral buckle with silicone oil, lazar treatment, cataract removal and removal of the silicone oil. The last surgery was 2 years ago and I've been told my eye has recovered very well, all things considered. My vision in the eye isn't great and Im shortsighted in the other eye so I wear glasses but my vision is OK all things considered. As a result of the surgery's, I have been diagnosed with increased pressure in my eye and have been prescribed azarga and travatan to treat this. I've been taking these drops over 5 years with no issues that I know of. My partner and I have decided we want to try for a baby. I read a warning on my eye drops information leaflet that they are not safe for pregnant woman. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, the specialist eye hospital I attend as an outpatient has cancelled my last 4 appointments, my next appointment is scheduled for January 2021, but I don't know if this will go ahead. I consulted with my GP doctor to see what my options would be. My GP contacted the drugs information authority in my country on my behalf and contacted my specialist. The drug information authority advised that there is no human data on the effects of the drops I'm using on pregnancy, but there's an active ingredient that may increase the risk of miscarriage. I was also told that these drops are not suitable for women of childbearing age. My GP is still waiting to hear back from the specialist and has told her advice would be to wait and see what the specialist says. It's been over a month. I feel very helpless, the waiting is torture. Would anyone have any advise on alternative medications available? I really want to start a family and I'm terrified that I'll never be able to become pregnant or if I am able to carry a baby, I'll lose my eyesight. "
10831,"Thank you. It means a lot to me that you would provide a statistical probability like that, because I had trouble finding one. I know that this was a hard question to read through because it was worded so specifically. It's also good to know that developing at my age isn't unheard of. Ive seen some things say, in the 30s it just isn't going to happen unless it was missed so that made me think of this question. Everything I've read makes it sound like you are either just over 40 and could start to get it, or if you are 39 and under you might just have late onset juvenile and be really unlucky and be looking at some years of damage. "
10832,How long can we do it? I mean on average it'd take 10 years to go from diagnosis to legal blindness. Can a proper and early treatment stop the progression or perhaps extend the timeframe to about 30-40 years until we go legally blind?

10835,"N.B.: Not looking for a diagnosis or medical advice; I'm interested in the pathophysiology. I have seen an optician who said my eyes were healthy. I'm in my late 20's. My vision started getting blurry around 17. I did not need to consistently wear glasses until about 22 in order to be functional. I did not have any astigmatism then and my prescription was minimal. Since then, every year my vision has gotten worse due to increasing severity of astigmatism. It is to the point were I need a new prescription every year; the cylinder of my script increases by about 0.25 a year. One eye is worse than the other (cylinder of 2.25 vs. 2.0). I wear daily disposable contacts a few days out of the week but religiously take them out because they bother my eyes after more than 8-12 hours of wear. Was hoping someone could explain the physiology behind why this happens and risk factors (those that exist beyond genetics). Thanks! "

Is Yes then the prescription might be wrong , if not , then I'm worried that I have something more than astigmatism , maybe Irregular astigmatism or KC , my doctor said my eyes look fine and there is nothing to worry about keratoconus , but ghosting still bothers me , it is less noticeable than before wearing glasses but it's still slightly there, what should I do?

10839,"Hello, I have had some double vision my whole life, but it seems to have gotten much more prominent lately. It's horizontal and binocular. I'm a musician who can no longer consistently track the baton, which is incredibly frustrating. I've had about half a diopter of base in prism in my glasses for most of my life. I first got a significant amount of prism in my glasses a few years ago. (I'm also fairly nearsighted. It got slowly worse over the years before bottoming out recently at about -5.) I always felt like the amount of prism wasn't quite right. This summer I visited my ophthalmologist for my routine eye exam, and turns out I needed much more prism. Over the past few months, we've added a Fresnel lens to both sides of my glasses. I'm up to 24 diopters of base in prism now. Once, my ophthalmologist mentioned that he'd never seen anyone take that much prism so well so quickly, and that sometimes you can add more prism and the eyes adjust and want more. At this point we're really hoping my double vision will quit needing even more correction so I can get strabismus surgery. Possible complicating factor: I have functional neurological disorder. I was on 20 mg citalopram for the last several months to treat it, before having to quit it cold turkey a month ago due to intolerable cognitive side effects. I've heard citalopram can decrease your ability to compensate for diplopia? I'm having a hard time finding any information on what to expect with this much exotropia. Is there any way to know whether it's likely to keep getting worse? I would really appreciate any resources and information on dealing with this much double vision. Thank you! "

I also use my computer 8+ hours a day for work and for gaming. My hopes are that I would be able to continue using my phone without needing contacts/glasses. Following this surgery I may be interested in pursuing lasik in the next year. It would be great if I could use my computer / drive without vision correction as well after the lasik.

For about the last week or so I've been having my right eye produce tears. I'll just be sitting doing nothing and then a single tear will collect on my eyelid. I will wipe it away and then in about a minute another will collect. It's really my only symptom aside from my eye getting a little blurry as the tear is produced and once wiped away my vision is normal. Eye isn't really red and it isn't irritated. No nasal congestion, some post nasal drip, but it's hard to know if that's from GERD or AR. No other notable allergy symptoms. It's only my right eye as well. It's getting annoying because I keep wiping it by impulse and it's irritating the skin around my eye. Is this something that calls for immediate dr visit? We're in a stay at home order here in Los Angeles so I'm doing my best to avoid medical spaces if possible. Any info is greatly appreciated. Thank you! "

10846,"Hello, I recently started on my (26F) contact journey and am having some issues finding the right fit and I'm wondering if the issues I'm dealing with are normal. The first issues I'm having is with a red ring around the iris. My doctor says it's because my eyes are not hydrated enough and that I'm wearing them too long. But I'm using eye drops up to four times a day and I don't wear them longer than 8 hours right now. The second issue is my astigmatism. She had both my eyes at axis -0.57 but my right eye was still blurry so she up it too -1.25. It's a lot better, but now my left eye is having trouble focusing? The third issue is I am having trouble looking at screens that are up close like my laptop and phone. It hurts my eyes a lot. The fourth issue is mostly focusing. After I blink things are clear, but go unfocused within seconds. The fifth issue if floaters. I've had floaters in my left eye since I saw in fourth grade and I can normally ignore them. Now I'm seeing them more clearly and more in both eyes. They're not always black spots, sometimes grayish black lines, or spots of bright. Everything feels distorted. It feels like I have my eyes open underwater. Like, I'm able to see but it feels like there are is something over my eye even though there isn't anything there. The sixth issue is head aches. I'm getting really bad headaches a night, especially after taking my contacts out and switching to my glasses before I go to bed. My eye sight it's good enough for me to take my contacts out and walk around the house before bed. I have to have my glasses in or I will run into stuff. I've expressed this all to my eye doctor and she said they are just things I'll have to get used too, but it's been over a month since I started wearing contacts and I thought by now I would be used to it.

10847,Early Sjo test is a good indicator. Only one lab in county. Regular blood tests for Sjogrens can be negative. Lip biopsy has to be done by a lab that commonly does Sjogren biopsies. It can be an easy false negative. Ultrasound of saliva glands is becoming a better standard than lip biopsy. Your also young enough that you may not have much damage yet. I clearly had problems in late teens. Took to late 30s before a doctor even mentioned Sjogrens. it's suspected that males present differently than females. Sjogren Foundation has a lot of good and more up to date information. Also look at John Hopkins site for Sjogrens. A young and arrogant Rumatologist stated in clear confindemxe That it wasn't Sjogrens. A much better one ran a lot more Tests and actually listened to my history. 
10848,Haters gonna hate. 20/20 with sclerals is very possible for me. I suspect I'm closer to 20/15 on an eye chart and 20/20 for practical stuff. Alas my eye docs chart doesn't go finer than 20/20. 
10849,"First, neither of my parents have glasses and they're 63. They have mild far-sightedness, for which they use cheapo Costco reading glasses to read menus and their phones. They also work white collar computer jobs, and my Dad is also an engineer who's a workaholic and works wayyy more hrs than me. Neither do my mom's brother and sister. So I don't buy into the genetic argument. I first got glasses back in 2008, when I was 22, a year or so after college. I think I was a -1.75 / -2.00. left eye is 0.25 worse. I go in for yearly appointments. For almost 10 years, it stayed relatively stable. Maybe increased by -0.50 in that span. In fact, sometime in 2012-2014, I remember my optometist telling me that my vision was stable for the past 2 or 3 years, therefore I qulify for LASIK or PRK or something. Well a couple years back (2018?) I notice my viison isnt the best. This is when I'm 32. Things far away seem slightly blurry. Subtitles on TV don't look as sharp, esp from left eye. My vision increased to -2.75, -3.00! Also told I have mild astigmatism in left eye. I go in summer 2020, and told my vision was now -3.25, -3.50. Just went last week, told my vision was -3.50, -3.75! What gives? I was under the impression myopia stops progressing when you get older? My computer usage has stayed the same, even during the pandemic. In fact, starting with the pandemic, early 2020, I began using my home monitor which is only 1080p, so has bigger text than my 2K monitor from work. I even upgraded my TV from 55"" to a 75"" in 2018, so it got bigger (easier to see). I'm worried because well, everything I read says myopia progression usually stops in adults. And obviously I'm going into optometrist for a yearly exam so there isnt any other undrelying cause. Please help, because this is killing my self confidence and causing depression. I don't like the idea of going blind or being physically dependent on my glasses or contacts. At this rate will be -5 by the time I'm 40? -6 by the time I'm 45? I don't want to wake up and no even be able to get to the bathroom without my glasses. It's the feeling that if I were to lose or break my glasses while out, I'll be stranded and helpless. "
10850,"Yes! I was literally so offended, I called my doctor out immediately over messaging. Like, do you think that someone with suspected Sjogrens, who developed 13 cavities in a few months, neglects their oral health? Sweet baby Jesus I was pissed. That's a pretty blatant way to tell me you don't think I take care of myself and that I lie to you about it. Dentist was actually weirdly similar about it with me, even insisting on showing me out to floss again and just high key did not believe me that I take care of myself. I don't know why 13 cavities didn't make anyone's alarm bells go off. "
10851,"I just had my measurement appointment to deal with cataracts. I asked that before they dilated my eyes to measure my semi-dark adapted pupils (I'm an life long amateur astronomer). The technician/assistant darkened the room and waited about 5 minutes then measured 8mm (which is huge given that I'm in my early 60's and the norm is around 5mm for my age) -- this also matched a rough measurement that I did using a flash camera in a totally dark room. I did mention the measurement with the eye surgeon, but he didn't seem to be overly concerned. However I do feel a little apprehensive about the possible outcome with visual artifacts given that most IOLs are 5 to 6mm in diameter. Am I being overly paranoid? (Another factor is that I'm very picky about my vision -- years ago an optician tried to put me in to a high index lens -- which I gave an honest try for a week or two, but I couldn't adapt to the ""fish bowl"" results, I've been using glass lenses for most of my life). I know that getting an IOL is a process of compromises. I do trust the eye surgeon -- from what I understand he is one of the better surgeons in the region. "

I spend a lot of time looking at screens (up to 12 hours a day), don't really get to go outside much, and unfortunately spend a lot of time looking at my phone in the dark while lying in bed. The fast progression of vision loss is scaring me. I used to be able to read things while squinting if I took my glasses off, and now I can't see anything at all. Any advice? "
10853,"Hi, i've been doing sessions of eye training with my optometrist, i'm on 7 out of 12 sessions at the moment, and i've been doing great at pushing my eyes to focus a split image, see 1 image under thicker and thicker lenses... but there is one exercise I'm not even close to doing I don't know if every optometrist does this exercise but basically i old the little stick with the white ball at the end, I focus on the white ball, and the image she hold behind should appear in 3D. Everytime I get close to doing this my eyes just want to watch the picture and loose focus on the ball, and the 3D effect goes away and I have to retry again to no success. There is another one where I focus on the ball and I have to see a 3rd image between the two still images and I haven't been able to really see it consistently. My main issue is that my eyes/brain want to see the result and watch the pic, but the point of the exercise is to see the result behind the ball you're focusing on, and I can't hold that focus long enough. I'm not a hyper person at all and I never been diagnosed with ADHD but this seems like a focus problem. Do you have any tips or training at home I can do to help with that? "
10854,"I had many surgeries since I was as young as 2 years old, some minor and some major. Cataract surgery is very minimally invasive and usually successful. It is also an easy surgery to follow up on - as the poster said below, if you don't put a lens in now you can always do it later when the timing is appropriate. Not sure what's going on with your baby and why he needs a cataract removed, but I didn't have good depth perception until I was older due to a massive retinal tear, and had a happy and full childhood with no difference from other kids. The brain is amazing and can accommodate for many situations. I never felt disabled in anyway, even though I couldn't see well out of my left eye until my 20s. Now I am seeing 20/20. Good luck with the outcome. Babies are precious and resilient. We had our son on May 4.

Also can the doc see if that's happened on exam? Every year he does an exam and has never said anything. Besides the surgery (20 years ago now) the eyes have been good since. "

10862,"Hi. I hope this is okay to post here. I suffer from OCD and PTSD and I'm feeling anxious over my OCT scans.. I have pretty significant RNFL thinning in both my eyes in the superior quadrants (in the red) and slightly in the nasal quadrants (in the yellow).. it is completely symmetrical in both eyes and hasn't changed in 4 years with annual scans. Everything else on my OCT and exam is normal including a visual field test. My cup to disc ratio, etc is all good. My eye pressure was slightly high at 18 in both eyes but it was a handheld unit and I was severely anxious during the test.. I'm a 22 year old white female with no family history of glaucoma. I am slightly nearsighted in both eyes. I'm just being told to monitor this but they say they don't know what it is. I'm feeling very worried that I'll develop glaucoma. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Thank you for your help - I really appreciate it. "
10863,"Just want to say first off, sorry for the long post. I've filled in the details below but I have been for an eye test today as my headaches have been getting worse and I've noticed over the years that usually means my eyes have changed . getting a new script usually always helps even if marginal. The optometrist said I am now short sides in R, long in L and have astigmatisms. He did an eye health check and told me I had a blind spot in each eye. Both of them had them in a similar place but one was just a little further away from something (can't remember what exactly) and was a slightly different size and opacity. He showed me a picture and one was fairly white whilst the other was pretty translucent. He said he was going to send a letter to my GP for me to go to an eye clinic and get it checked out. I didn't ask much at the time, maybe cause I was a bit alarmed. I know this may sound stupid but it'll put my mind at ease. Is there any chance he just ""got a bad photo""<U+009D>/is being overly cautious? With covid etc, I'm not sure how long it's going to be before seeing an eye specialist so just trying to understand more about what it may be. I've done the usual and looked online but can't find much about what the problem would be if 2 blind spots are unsymmetrical in shape/size/opacity. Any info would be greatly appreciated and thanks for taking the time to read if you did. Info below. Location: Nothing in particular happened. Went for an eye test today and they did a health check on my eyes and told me that I have two blind spots (never been told this before) and he showed me that one of them was slightly different size, closer to ""something""<U+009D> than the other (can't remember what, sorry) and more translucent than the other. Onset: Nothing happened in particular but my migraines have been pretty bad the last month or so (daily, mainly pain around the eyes and bridge of nose). Frequency: I've never been told I have these blind spots before or been told there's been a hiccup on my eye health check but I have had frequent migraines for about 14yrs. On and off but this is the most frequent they've been in a long time. Type/Severity: Headaches have been pretty sharp! When they're not sharp they're dull and lingering for the rest of the day. I find I get moments throughout the day where I have trouble focusing on things with my eyes and it makes me feel pretty dizzy/disorientated? Self-treatment: Have tried several acute and preventative medications for my migraines that have on and off worked but now I just resort to ibuprofen or paracetamol if I can feel one coming on that might be bad or that I feel isn't going to fade off and linger. Effect: I function just fine but as said above, sometimes have moments where I feel really disorientated and can't focus on whatever I'm looking at at the time. Associated Symptoms: I've noticed I can be a bit clumsy in the morning (balance goes a bit off sometimes). Headaches as mentioned and I've been getting pain in my gums? The only other thing I can think of is sometimes I slur parts of words when I'm speaking or they'll come out in the wrong order (not sure if that's related). "
10864,"It's super super invasive. You need to consider it as a last resort, for good reason. Ophthalmology advances pretty quickly and PK has some serious complciations that come with it. Try all avenues (scleral lens, etc) before you open the transplant route. Things to consider are your age (how many times you expect to have to undergo the procedure as grafts don't last forever), your vision goals, etc. You can't keep cutting into the eye, as it causes more trauma and damage, so that's why I mention ""age"" as one important factor. If you're in your 20's it's usually a bad idea. I work with ophthalmologists working in regenerative medicine, and I'm looking forward to adipose-derived stem cell transplantation and would personally consider that, before invasive PK.

10865,"Now i am not a myopic neither do i have any eye or health issues but i'm a heavy phone user. Back in mid sep , i took a break off my phone work and started lifting. And god forbid i just googled 'floater's and ended up being shit scared about AMD , PVD and RD. I've had floaters since childhood. I've also checked out cures for floaters often. Last time was in march, then i forgot it. I've got a perfectionist attitude so even the slightest error annoys me. Thats why i keep digging stuff about floaters when i can just ignore it. After about 2 months of 10+ hrs usage. I searched it. Started working out. Stopped phone usage. Then i started seeing flash like stuff after googling it. Not anything like camera flash or lightning streaks. Its like specks or something. Idk exactly as i've never noticed them properly to put a description. I.e They aren'r obvious. Idk if floaters have gotten more or if its just that i'm noticing it more now. Its been like 8 weeks now. No changes in vision. No pain. Nothing. I've had light sensitivity couple of weeks back. But its normal now. Prolly due to spending too much time indoors. And the flash i'm seeing isn't exactly what i read here. Nothing like camera flash but out of nowhere i see a tiny bright speck sometimes. Not sure if i had it before. And its like dependent on distance. When i look far away seems like its a speck at a distance. When i read its like right in front of my eye. Last less than a millisecond. Floaters like a transparent brown speck had started to appear back then, i had worms like floaters since childhood. Again unsure whether i had brown ones before. And sometimes when i stare at bright walls and blink. The wall seems like flashing. And its contrasting too. Like i tried looking at both a bright wall and a door which goes outside and it appears that only the wall flashes. I've also noticed that at night, when i close my eyes for a while and open when there's some illumination , i see that my vision is flashing dimly until it adjusts itself (takes 5s approx). I've had mild double vision (only on screens at 20-25ft and black on white backgrounds) since 2015 i guess. Its been static. No changes since then. Today i went out of home after 8 months and i was shit scared at the floaters. Idk if they've increased or i'm just noticing them more. Am i at any serious risk? AMD? I read it here and seems like there's no connection between phone use and AMD. But PVD and RD? Can't visit a doc now. All appts are unavailable till january. "
10866,"Don't apologize - I really hope this helps! I also want to say, I am also on a computer pretty much 24/7, and this still helps me. My house is also incredibly dim, with minimal light fixtures. This post is long, but I want to be thorough and also don't want to tell you something unsafe, so going to share what I've learned. Sorry for the length. **Setup**: In my small room, I now have 4 light sources: (1) small window (with minimal sunlight, as it's usually shaded) (2) one light on ceiling (3) A floor lamp like [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mainstays-White-5-Light-Floor-Lamp-with-Multi-Colored-Shades/32802339? wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0) (4) a desk lamp clamped to the nightstand beside my bed. **Before, all I had was the one ceiling light and the window - (3) and (4) is what I just recently moved in, which has had the impact** In the floor lamp and desk lamp, I have put in 100W equivalent bulbs with a light temperature of 6500K, and a brightness of 1600 lumens. (please see the bottom of this post about these numbers, I have included some important safety info, as well as explaining why they are relevant.) My ceiling lamp had just a bulb of regular light temperature and brightness - maybe 2500K light tempearture and 500 lumens. **Positioning of lights**: for the floor lamp with the crazy bendy lights, each of those lights is positioned kind of diagonally upwards. It just brightening the room itself, and if I look at lamp, I can only see part of the bulb (it's mostly obscured by the plastic coverings, due to the way it's pointed upwards). The desk lamp tends to be pointed 90 degrees away from me (not sure if I'm saying that right - I mean, if I'm facing directly in front of me, looking in front of me, the bulb is pointing that same direction). Vertically, it is about eye level to me. These bulbs are too bright for me to stare directly in to, and it hurts my eyes if I look at them. But it does not hurt my eyes to just have them brightening the room like this. **How I use the lights**: I have these 4 components (floor lamp, desk lamp, ceiling light, and window) on the entire time I am awake. When I wake up in the morning, I switch the desk lamp on before I do anything else. It immediately helps me feel awake. I also now keep the curtains on all my windows open all day, and keep all the lgihts on in the house. (Painful as I light to save energy, but the impact is incredible.) **About Sunlight**: Sunlight is more effective than artificial lights. Sometimes when I feel tired, I just go to the window and open the glass and enjoy the sunlight. I also started taking walks early in the morning. On another note (and possibly unrelated, but still useful), my PCP and neurologist have both told me that viewing natural sunlight within 30 minutes of waking will help reset/regulate circadian rhythm, and increase wakefulness. Even with cloud cover, natural light is going to be more effective than artificial light, as far as I'm aware. I've started going out for 5-10 minutes each morning after I wake up, and I believe it has helped. **Please read this safety info**: I mentioned my new bulbs (the ones that are so effective at keeping me awake) are 100W equivalent, 6500 K, and 1600 lumens. Please note the 100W 'equivalent' part - watts are a measurement of energy used. Much of this energy is let off as heat. Most floor lamps will only tolerate bulbs drawing a max of 40W. Above that, the high heat can be a fire hazard. Incandescent bulbs draw the most wattage. Do NOT put some 100W incandescent bulb in a floor lamp; it could be dangerous or at the very least, ruin the lamp. CFL bulbs (the 'spiral bulbs') and LED bulbs require less watts than an incandescent of the same brightness, and thus produce less heat (which is why they say things like '100W equivalent' - it's saying that it'll produce the same amount of light that a 100W incandescent bulb would produce, but for less watts - probably something more like 10 - 20 watts.). So these would generally be OK to put in a floor lamp. The point here, is that if you want to put bright bulbs in a floor lamp / desk lamp, etc, **check how many watts the lamp is rated for, then check the** ***actual watts*** **your lightbulb consumes, and don't go over that.** **About light temperature (the 6500K I mentioned)** - light temperature - the color of the light - is also important here. At least, I was recently told by an electrician, that light temperature will have a greater effect on wakefulness than brightness (lumens) will. Around 5000K I believe will mimic daylight colors. [Graph showing what different light temperatures correlate to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature#Categorizing_different_lighting). **You want a light temperature closest to daylight settings as possible**. The general cheap lightbulb you get at the store probably has a light temperature of around 2500K or so. I believe my ceiling light was probably around this range - it helped wake me up too, but not anywhere near as much as my new bulbs. "
10867,thanks dude. I don't really see it as perfect because my tbut is still less than what is normal for a normal person (10s). I guess my contacts contributed to this fact. I'll keep on putting restasis. Thanks for info from you. 
10868,"Hi. I was diagnosed with a very advanced keratonus in 2009 and got PK in 2009 (I was 20), in my left eye, and in 2011 in my right eye. Fast forward to 2020 (31 years old), I have a a very high cylinder, all my sutures are gone. So high that it is hard to find any posts on reddit of people with such high cyl. I went in for an eye exam with a lasik specialist last week to see if I can get lasik or prk, I was told I can not and the doctor told me to look into CXL. I use glasses. I think I was told my cyl is -8.5 in my right eye and -5.5 in my left eye, and from doing research and reading a lot of people's experience, that is extreme astigmatism. I had known about CXL since about 2016, but didn't think anything of it, I thought it was too late for me to do anything else to correct my vision. And CXL is better to catch keratoconus in its early stages, not at 31, 10 years after after corneal transplants. I've been looking into all options, CXL, toric icl, intacs, and have an appointment with a clinic which does all 3 of these. My question is, is anyone here with keratoconus, who had pk done, did anything else to improve their eyes afterward? My goal is to improve my uncorrected vision as much as possible, and I do not mind needing to use glasses after improving my uncorrected vision. I appreciate any information you could could provide. (not asking for medical advice, just asking for experiences with other operations post-pk). "
10869,"Looking back, as a child I definitely had chronic dry mouth issues... Like probably starting as far back as 6 years old. My lips were also very dry, not chapped from licking them or anything like that. Chapstick never seemed to help so I found myself with a lip picking habit. At around 20 I started to develop more issues such like dry eye, dry nose, dry skin, etc. And id say my dry mouth is even worse now. I also have more aches and pains, and sometimes I wake up feeling like I got hit by a truck. I haven't gotten diagnosed yet but I'm wondering if the dryness I experienced as a child could have been related to this disease? Or could it have been something else? "
10870,I can't be sure from this far away that's why I suggest visit the doctor an ophthalmologist if you must ! Because you are 17 and the blur at near is kinda off ! Unless you had problems with near vision from birth. 
10871,"I am in my early 30s. The main reason why I end up taking my glasses off is that I find it uncomfortable to read like that for any length of time. It's like trying to focus on something that's too close to your face. Like I say my prescription is only very mild. For that reason why I'm walking around my house, I do not wear glasses. I only really wear them when I need to focus on something, or when I leave the house (so I can see into the distance). I too suspect that it is astigmatism causing the fuzziness. I was just curious if ordering a cheap pair without the short-sighted correction was an option. I don't especially want to visit the opticians right now mostly due to the virus. "

10873,"Hi, I've posted here before about new glasses causing severe disorientation. I got a response telling me to just give them time. I did that and it just didn't work. The lenses were polycarbonate. I tried on someone else's glasses recently who has a very similar RX to mine, and there was zero disorientation (however, they have no idea what their material is). I tried on another pair of someone else's, with the same RX as the last one and they were super disorienting. Her glasses were made with super thin material because her frames are so thin, they're barely there - she also didn't know exactly what they were, just that she was told that she'd experience disorientation if she wanted lenses that work with that frame. My RX is -5 and -5.25. When I wear my old frames/lenses, I'm fine as well, but they're so old, no idea what they're made from. Got my eyes checked recently - my RX hasn't changed in 10+ yrs and still hasn't, so it's not that I'm adjusting to stronger glasses. Wouldn't even be getting new lenses if the frames weren't so dated and the lenses weren't scratched. Any suggestions? I was reading that Trivex can be less disorienting, but not sure. I'll be ordering plastic frames.. I don't care for/need super thin lenses. I notice with my lenses, as well as the other guy's i tried on who I did fine with, have more of a curve to the lens itself. Both of the disorienting/thin ones were sort of flat. I'd be super grateful for any help. Thank you so much, in advance. "

10875,"Flickering is associated with traction/tugging on the retina. This can be from a retinal tear or detachment, but more commonly (thankfully) is associated with a PVD, especially in a high myope like yourself. Your treatment plan sounds very appropriate unless you notice worsening symptoms. High IOP is not an imminent cause for concern on its own. High IOP is more concerning if it's accompanied with family history of glaucoma, thinner corneas, and optic nerve atrophy among other things. Also IOP in the mid twenties doesn't always require treatment but should be monitored regularly, like at least once a year. "

She swears these vitamins have saved her vision. Is this wishful thinking? Couldn't say. Check it out; YMMV, good luck! "
10877,"When I got CXL the procedure was only 5 years old, so my doctor said it would last at least 5 years but they really didn't know how much more. That was 11 years ago and it's been stable since then :). "
10878,I went to the optometrist the other day and tried to relax my eyes while he used a machine that showed an image with different lenses over it. He said it showed that I might be farsighted and that I have possibly been straining my eyes by 2nd nature to read things up close my whole life (I'm 16) so he decided to dilate my pupils and confirmed I needed glasses. I don't know why but I'm getting anxiety over whether I was relaxing my eyes or just unfocusing them leading the optometrist and machine to think I was farsighted. Should I just trust my optometrist? I cant help but wonder if I made a mistake relaxing my eyes. The other thing is that while my pupils were dilated he used the lens machine and showed me what my vision would look like with/without glasses and when my pupils were dilated I had no choice but to relax my eyes. There were lenses that allowed me to see better. I basically am getting anxious and just want a second opinion LOL.

10880,"I agree that the fitter is extremely important but all lenses are not similar. I have worn 3 different type of sclerals over the past 12 years and the fitting was different for each of them, as was the material they were made of. I doubt there would ever be a ranking of lenses due to the fact that everyone's eyes are different and what works for one person may not work for the next. "

10882,"That's what reading glasses or the ""add on prescriptions are for. Ask your optometrist to assess your vision for the specific focal length you're having issues with. It's not uncommon to use bifocals in myopia control, but you'll have to discuss that with your OD. At about 45 we all need reading prescriptions. There's a couple theories as to why, but basically our eyes loose the ability to accommodate, or focus on closer focal points. It doesn't matter if you've got myopia or hyperopia. "
10883,"As someone who has won the battle with Keratoconus, I like to answer all of our newly diagnosed people with this message :) -First of all, do not panic. KC does NOT mean the end of your eyesight or your world. You are now embarking on a journey, a KC journey. I was diagnosed in 1968 and 1970 when there was no such thing as CXL, Sclerals and transplant procedures were primitive. I had successful transplants (1980, 1982) and I am now in glasses 20/25 and 20/40. My advice to you is: 1. Not panic 2. Find a doctor and lens fitter that you trust. It's YOUR eyesight. Get a 2nd opinion if you need it. 3. Follow his/her instructions 4. If you have ANY problems or concerns, contact them. Even when it is after clinic hours, there is always someone on call to help. Yes, you have support online, something I didn't have in my day; however, run everything you read online by your doctor before any treatment; even advice from me :) There are so many great treatments today. The chances of needing transplants are much slimmer than in my day. You should do fine. Most get relief by CXL and Scleral lenses. I hope this calms your fears a bit :) \*\*\*\*\*Update,\*\*\*\*\*\* July, 2021 Saw my doctor on the 26th.. 39 and 41-year-old grafts are still clear and healthy. He is going to put me into scleral lenses. I get fitted on 9-1 and I and hope to get 20/20 once again :( Cornea transplants are NOT supposed to last this long. I am an exception to the rule. Talk to your doctor :) \*\*\*\*Update 11-26-21 Been in Scleral Lenses since June and they are GREAT. I have 20/20 in both eyes. "
10884,But according to what you mentioned earlier my pressures are within normal by a decent margin if adjusted for thickness. Just for input They aren't specifically worried about glaucoma I was the only one who was when I seen my pressures were in the low 20's (until of course I heard my corneas were thick). 
10885,"I went back to school at 26 also to pursue my optometry undergrad courses. I worked as an optician part time. This was extremely helpful now that I am a doctor, but it didn't help me getting into OD school as much as getting better grades would have. Optometry school admissions are mostly focused on getting the best students (test takers for boards). "
10886,"The only real difference in function is your eyes might be a lighter colour iris. I have naturally medium-blue eyes but a scleral will make them light blue, in bright lighting conditions. It shows in photos, probably to other people. So I've got one light blue eye and one ""normal"" eye. Might look weird to some, idk. Might not make a difference with your eyes, depending on colour they are. Sclerals are also difficult to put in and take out at first, but you'll get used to it eventually. Just takes practice. But once it's in, it's not going to fall out like an RGP that's not a great fit will. I've lost so many lenses that just fell out. Stupid pointy eyes. Personally I'd go with RGP lenses where possible. Much easier to put in & take out and if you can get a good fit on them you could have one for ten years like me. But may not always be an option depending on your eye situation, like mine. I'd be happy to answer any other questions you have. This is all just personal experience though, I'm not a professional or anything. "
10887,"I've tried RGP, hybrid and (now) scleral. I found the smaller size of the RGP lenses to be difficult to fit properly, often resulting in irritation or ghosting, particularly if/as they shift their position on your eye slightly throughout the day. They were also much more likely to shift or even fall out if disturbed, again causing vision distortion and irritation, also from my experience getting a comfortably fitting RGP can be a tedious process as the cone shape like distortion KC causes is not good for these in terms of comfort. Hybrid was slightly more comfortable, at least initially, for long time wear, but they degrade quickly with the the softer outer region, which can be difficult keep clean as time progresses and can again result in irritation or lack of vision clarity the worse this gets. They also need to be replaced annually, if not sooner from my experience. Scleral lenses have by far and above been the best overall, although the most expensive. I can wear my current pair for 12-16 hours with minimal irritation and the irritation only really begins when I get tired and my eyes start to dry out. And while the most expensive, provided you look after them well, are the longest lasting. I've had my current pair for close to 3 years now and don't feel the need to replace them just yet, but probably will close to the 4 year mark. If you're concerned about price consider the lifespan closely, as a hybrid lens that costs $250 but needs to be replaced annually will cost you more in the long run than a well fitted scleral that may cost $600 but could last 3-4 years. "
10888,"I was accepted into optometry school for this cycle and I'm starting to have some major doubts. My total debt would most likely be over 300k (undergrad and grad tuition, living expenses, etc.) and I've heard from multiple sources that ODs only make around 80-90k after taxes. That debt to income ratio is just terrible. I fell in love with this profession after I worked and shadowed at two different practices. I thought that it would be my lifetime career. But love isn't always healthy, and I don't know if this is right for me anymore after doing the math. Again, money isn't everything. I don't expect to have loads of it. But I have this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that I will have an enormous debt which I will never be free of. I currently live in a beautiful paid off house with my partner, who supports me regardless of the decision that I make. I'm mentioning this because if I do decide to go to school, when I finish I can at least live for free while I attack the debt. That is the one silver lining. But still, the interest on loans will probably eat me alive. If anyone can offer any insight on this, I really appreciate it. I'm just tired of feeling anxious and sad over this all the time. I want to make a decision so that I can move on with my life. "
10889," I've caught things early, 20/20 with both eyes still on the charts but life with only my bad eye (right) would be nasty. I could cope though. I don't want it to get worse, but it is already mildly ruined, so it's getting CXL'd tomorrow. . Let me know how it goes, man. I'm even more terrified since I'm legally blind in my bad eye (right eye). My left eye is like 20/40 with no double vision and 20/25 with double vision. During recovery, I'll be basically blind, which is ok but I'm scared shitless to worry if my left eye is really bad afterwards since I'm basically depending on it right now. I'm also 32- maybe my corneas won't deteriorate much as I'm older. Right. Its because as you get older, the cross-links in your corneas develop on their own over time. "
10890,You sound a lot like me. 1. Due strain is normal from bright lights. 2. Doing CXL early like at 18 is something that's a good thing. I had mine at 21 and I'm now 28 with no progression of my KC in that eye. 3. Contacts do help massively.my bad eye was too bad for a CXL and even in that one it takes away like 80% of the ghosting. I went from reading a few rows to surpassing the requirement for a driver's license. You being worried about contacts and sensitive eyes is just like me. But I've had mine now for almost a year. I made a comment a while back that got a lot of love about tips on putting contacts in. If you want i can find it. 
10891,"Just joined this sub. Good to see the issue is something we can all relate to! I found out I got it when I was 15 years old in 2008. I got a right-eye corneal transplant in Feb 2009, right in the middle of my high school years. Very painful experience that I will never forget, but it was only the beginning and I was scared... FF Jan of 2020. One day at work, my left side RGP lens was so old and worn, it fell out of my eye in the middle of my shift. Literally shattered into three pieces on the floor and I put my foot down. My Opto had always brought up Sclerals, but I never really looked in to it. By May of 2020, I was seeing in 4k Quantum LED HD man. Scleral lenses are the absolute best experience I have ever (seen through) in my journey through this semiblindness condition. As I write this, I am about to get a 3rd fitting session on my left lens today and I am waiting on insurance coverage results for CXL slated for December 2nd! A special thank you to those at Piedmont EyeCare OD and Charlotte Eye Ear Nose & Throat PA here in CLT. Cheers to getting through Keratoconus ðŸ¥•. "

It'll get a little staticky in spots, my floaters will be more apparent, my vision just gets weird. I usually have tiny flashing areas on occasion as well. Any reason for this?

10900,"OMG I've been having the same issue. My left eye drifts too and I use my right eye to see anything. I'm 26, I got diagnosed with keratoconus in August. I've noticed a drifting a couple years back, But the eye doctor that I had before never told me anything not even about my keratoconus. I am really insecure about my left eye too because I know it's the first thing that people notice about me. Like I don't even take pictures anymore. Now I wear sunglasses all the time just to hide it. "
10901,"More info: I don't know if I can even see an eye doctor now with the pandemic, but I'm worried that even if I *can* that might cause trouble for my drivers license. I'm the only caregiver for three people who depend on me and I can't lose my license. And I can drive safely if I close one eye. It's been getting worse though and bothers me a lot. More background: I wear glasses but haven't seen an eye doctor in ten, maybe 15 years (money), I just keep getting glasses from Zenni with the same prescription. Now that I finally have money to spend on it, there's the pandemic, and worries about my driver's license. Ughh. My previous diagnosis was near sighted ness, astigmatism, and Eastphoria (I think that's what it was?) I've always had to close one eye reading distant things, like the aisle signs in the grocery store. A few years ago it got to where I had to close one eye more often while doing close up tasks, like cutting vegetables. In the last few months, when I try to drive or look at far away things, it's like I see a blurry double, or like my eyes won't...mesh right, or something. I don't know how to describe it. Driving with both eyes open is hard, like getting a strained headache, and everything threatens to double up if I can make it come together at all. Like the title says I'm scared if I tell an eye doctor this I'll lose my license. I've just been keeping one eye closed. It's easier with my right eye closed, but I've experimented and it's ok, just a bit more blurry, if I keep my left closed instead. Thanks for any advice or info or encouragement. *hugs*. "
10902,"Background: I'm a 20 year old with high myopia (around -10 diopters) and recently met with a refractive surgery clinic. They recommended Toric ICL for me, and they did go over the risks (glaucoma, cataracts), but assured me that I was a perfect candidate and would likely have no issues. However, I'm applying to medical school this summer, so while I'm excited to have something like this and have been wanting it for so long, I'm worried that making a reckless decision here could screw up all of my dreams. I have read mostly good things about Toric ICL, but I've also noticed that a lot of optometrists and ophthalmologists tend to stay in glasses, so does anyone have any thoughts on why that may be? Does anyone know about something regarding this procedure that I might not be aware of? Any thoughts/perspectives are welcome! "

The halos also vanish when I look at the edge of my glasses lense. When I take my glasses off, I just see starbursts like I normally do. I'm very myopic and am glaucoma suspect, but I am on latanoprost drops nightly. I'm 32 years old. I'm wondering if these could be glaucoma halos or if some other condition could cause these. I don't have any associated pain with them. Are there any distinguishing characteristics of glaucoma halos VS other types of halos? Thanks in advance! "
10904,"I'm 23F and about two weeks ago, my left eye was extremely red, sensitive to light, burning, etc. Since my eye doctor was closed due to coronavirus, I just hoped it would get better. 3 days later, the redness and burning went away, but my vision became blurry and the eyes were still sore. At this point, I called my eye doctor and got an emergency appointment. He said that I had some white blood cells in my cornea and prescribed my ofloxacin. He said to take it for seven days and if it was better I could stop and if it wasn't better to take it for three more days. I took it for the seven days and the eye itself felt better but vision was still weaker than normal so I took it on the eighth day. However, then my eyes started to burn when I put in my second dose on the eighth day so from there I decided my eyes were well enough to stop. Yesterday was the ninth day and did not take anything. This morning (the tenth day), I have some burning back in my eye. No redness but the eye is very tender and sore to move. Any idea what could be going on? Does my eye still have an infection? Should I use artificial tear drops to see if that helps? Thanks everyone! "

10906,"So I went in yesterday for an eye exam, and the doc noticed that I had lattice degeneration in both eyes during dilation. She also said I have astigmatism and moderate myopia according to my prescription. I read online that this degeneration happens to myopic people, but most of them have strong prescriptions that are way higher than mine. She also told me that my eye oil glands are clogged and that causes me to have dry eyes. I'm worried about the degeneration and what it could mean going forward. We also did a retinal imaging exam and everything looked normal there, I guess the question is why am I getting degeneration with moderate myopia? Is this normal? Prescrption: OD: Sphere -2.25; Cylinder -0.75; Axis 005 OS: Sphere -2.5; Cylinder -0.50; Axis 020 I don't really know what these numbers mean and if they're normal or abnormal.

I'm going to attach a fairly gross picture of my problem eye. It isn't always as inflamed as it looks in the photo, but it is always red to some extent. Sometimes it's worse, but mostly it's about the same. I've had this condition since I was a small child, which makes it 13-15 years. Has anyone ever had anything similar? Does anyone know what to make of it? I initially thought it was pingueculitis but the timelines don't match. The specialist thought it was a nevus and tried some injections to cut off the blood supply to the surrounding area, but that didn't work. "
10910,"I have just had an eye examine with a view to getting a new prescription abroad. It felt really rushed and I was not shown how the new prescription would look despite requesting this. I wonder can a machine produce reasonably accurate prescriptions? I was hooked up to a machine that displayed kinda two rows of white picket fences stretching out to a vanishing point. I was not clearly told what this was (possibly language problems being in a non English speaking country). Could this have measured my near sightedness? He also tested what i presume was my astigmatism hand holding a lens with a little metal extrusion to hold it by on the frame. he rotated it but it felt rushed and I was not confident I had selected the best clarity. I asked him to perform it again which he did (In seconds) and told me it was 90% correct (which irritated). I'm 61 btw. In summary could the machine I mentioned measure near sightedness and can I have confidence in the astigmatism test (its changed quite a lot for the better even disappearing in one eye). Sorry for the long post, worried about expense of new inaccurate spectacles and the costs of repeat tests. "

I had a few MRIs throughout childhood but they never showed anything of concern. As you can imagine, I struggled with strabismus for a long time. I had surgery a few years ago for the horizontal muscles, though the vertical ones still are lazy. Just not as noticable as the horizontal ones. I'm happy with the results and my lazy eye only really comes out when I'm tired. The strabismus surgery was the only time that I interacted with anyone outside of a regular optician since I was 10 or so. I'm 26 and want to make sure I'm taking care of my good eye moving forward.

10914,"Last Tuesday (before 10 days) I did a cataract surgery. The first few days I had triple vision. Especially bright lights were forming two circles, each with different diameter. It was quite psychedelic. Now on day 10 I have mostly double vision. I use an app to check my visual acuity just to know where I am. When I form a hole with my hand and look through with the eye I did surgery the double vision goes away and the visual acuity increases. I am 32 and the reason I had cataract was because of an injury. My corneal has a cut so my vision will never be 100% clear again. I wonder if this double vision is caused from this or it's only from the surgery because the inner lense is still adjusting. The doctors told me to wait one month and then I will know for sure if the double vision will go away or if I will have to use some glasses. What do you think? "

My central vision is 6/9 corrected, my prescription has barely changed since my diagnosis 25 years ago. I've had cataracts for around 15 years but it's only been in the last two when reading & navigating started becoming difficult that my doctor recommended surgery. I don't remember glare being a problem before the cataracts but since it's been so long, I'm not sure how much is due to the cataracts and how much the RP.

My prescription was just increased AGAIN and my contacts are up up to a -9.5 in the R eye and -8.5 in the L eye.

10921,"Hello everyone, I have really bad myopia and I've been happily using daily contact lenses ever since I was 12 (32 now). I've recently started using different types of lenses by different (well known and respectable) brands and I've noticed that most monthly ones cause major discomfort to my eyes, my throat feels weird when I swallow, my ears start feeling stuffy not to mention my forehead getting hot too. As soon as I take them out I feel better immediately. Of course I'm not going to wear them anymore and I'm switching back to my good old focus dailies, which have never given me any trouble; but I was curious to understand why this happened but I found no results on the web. Has anyone had the same kind of experience? "
10922,"I feel so stupid and careless. I wore the same contact lenses that were 1 week only to a month and my left eye has been feeling so itchy lately and dry whenever I used those contact lenses. This final week of the month has been so brutal. Although eyes weren't intensely red, they felt fairly dry to the point I purchased dry eye drops. It didn't change anything. I removed the lenses and it's late at night. I put my glasses back on. I step outside and I can see Halos everywhere on every porch light source in the neighborhood with my left eye. I clean them and it's the same effect. I drive at the night often with glasses but this night I'm finding myself covering my left eye just to get through the roads. Is it official? I fucked myself over and have an eye cataract at a mere age of 23? Im so pissed at doing this to myself. "
10923,"Is it hard to get accostumed to them? They can be incredibly difficult for some, though most do seem to overcome any issues. Ultimately experiences will vary, but the majority here post about getting used to insertion with practice and subsequently seeing a great improvement in comfort with them compared to wearing smaller RGPs. [If you scroll down the sub or search for posts on RGPs and sclerals you'll find many accounts of use of both types. [**Here's another recent post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keratoconus/comments/hn5qq6/scleral_vs_rgp_lenses/) on them.] Are they a bit uncomfortable after a long day? I've tried them periodically for around eleven years and just not managed to achieve a comfortable fit with scleral lenses, even for brief stints. On occasions that I've been able to put one in - invariably after protracted struggles - I've always found it to be worse for me than a smaller lens, in both comfort and vision. I'd still take an unstable smaller lens, and will probably continue to until they stop fitting altogether. I also want to be prepared dor anything. That's undoubtedly the best approach to have, and I'm only posting a relatively negative personal experience with them to highlight potential difficulty. Obviously differences in each case need to be taken into account; I've not had cross-linking, so you should be at a much better starting point than I was even on first trying sclerals. Best of luck with them. "

Whilst my KC isn't as bad as quite a lot of people on this subreddit, it is still annoying seeing those ghost images and double vision. In my personal experience, I had CXL done and got fitted with scleral lenses fairly quick (on the NHS, I paid roughly <U+00A3>100 for the entire treatment). The scleral lenses are life changing, and can be easy to put in with some practice. I found it difficult to touch my eye when I first started, but now I can get my lens in within 10 seconds. If you have a search around on the subreddit, you'll find how these kind of lenses have changed people's lives. Just like you, I used to get very upset thinking how I would never see the world how it is meant to be seen, until I got these lenses. Good luck and hang in there. Even though it seems bad, there is always a way forward. Medicine and technology are developing everyday. "
10931,"42. I was diagnosed around 24. I've had 3 holcomb c3r treatments since then and intacts, about 7 eye surgeries total. I'm at the stage now where it's better to tear out the substrate <U+00A6>(corneas) & be done with it all. urgery has evolved a good bit since the last 18 years so I've got that going for me and I've learned alot more about health and nutrition. I also picked up a key detail that instead of just going in blindly and hoping the transplant works I'll do the blood work test and get a matching blood type donor (slight increase in acceptance I've read when blood types match) and also matching the gender (I read that sometimes x and y histamines can cause an inflammatory response where as matching male to male or female to female transplant parts also reduces chances of complications/rejections due to x and y incompatibility.) I've read arguments over this detail, but because I have found data supporting my view, my subconscious feels strongly more positive about a better outcome by following this advice than ignoring it, therefore I will follow this advice in my own course of action of making sure donor tissue matches gender and blood type. This isn't a life saving surgery so I don't mind waiting a little while longer for an exact tissue match. ome surgeons scoff at this idea yet seeing people with multiple corneal transplants tells me otherwise and that this idea is worth putting into play for the surgery to improve my success rates. 'Why do I have this condition? hronic life long inflammation in my body. o why doesn't it make sense to screen ahead for a matching blood type and gender' I'd tell the surgeons in the past. They would simply state that its okay, there are immunosuppressant drugs they can put me on and then they can always redo the transplant! I politely say, 'fuck no,' we're going to screen ahead and match to give me the maximum chance of a first time success rate so I only will need to do this surgery once in my life. "
10932,"I've just spent the last year dealing with this issue. I tried 12-15 different gas permeable lenses. All of them failed me, as my cornea was too steep in my bad eye. They were the most uncomfortable lenses I have ever used and felt like I had a piece of glass over my eye. I could never get to a point where they ever felt like there wasn't an irritant in my eye. I've now been through 5 different trial pairs of Scleral lenses and am almost at my final lenses. If I could do it all over again, I would have not tried any of the Hard permeable gas lenses, and would have just started with scleral. The hard lenses were very uncomfortable and both kept migrating during the day. If Scleral is an option, they are 100% more comfortable for me, and once you learn how to use them, they are much easier. As to both eyes or one eye. I have it bilaterally with my left eye stable and my previous main source of vision (without correction). I have Sclerals in both eyes, with the left eye only being a slight correction. My doctors reasoning was that having in the other eye helped protect and shape my other eye's cornea. "

10935,"Here , Thank your , may I ask what's the 30Hz test ? Looks not below normal is That high intensity light tolerance is that my understanding ? . The optic nerve specialist ruled out the left eye was below normal due crosslink , laser ( keratoconus) . The dot ( upper image ) don't know if is right or left , but the retina specialist attributes that birth mark , possible laser injure ( not from exposure but from my operation ) . But she wants to monitor . Now the black and white test was performed twice ( don't know the reason ) that's a concern to me . Secondly the retina specialist she keeps insisting there was not bleach due the pico second blue ( I think the max observance is at 430) and this was 440mn . Due the cornea , lense and virtuous. My mayor concern was RPE damage but this is where physics come into place ( exposure time , how far from face , etc etc ) . Moving forward yes the left eye can be corrected with +1.50 and the left one +.50 . The optician told me those were reading glasses prescription when they're not. Left eye shows slightly lense cloudiness but not as much as the right one . Usually happens at late age ( I am only 40 ) . Realistically speaking I saw the blue light and was inches away from my face so did reach the retina . Next day "" floaters "" ok perfect those are antibodies ? Left eye has a transparent spot only visible on straight lines ( no parallel) see upper picture macula . They don't know what's causing distortion . Recently they rule stigmatism both eyes ( inward ) . That explains why I came crying after contacts ( plastic ) didn't work . They offer rigid contacts but they're expensive . Correct me if i am wrong but cataracts both eyes causes ( far sight ) in stead of myopia ? A year ago my good eye was the left and my bad eye was the right according to the optician now is inverse. New Tuesday I have another ERG without glasses and a color OCT , they will inject me to look into the retina and take a pic of it . I don't know where the distortion is coming from and why faces look washed out from far away . I have been back and forth a year 1/2 and they want to to do a case study in New York . They don't "" know "" . Cornea , crystalline, virtuous or retina. Say what ? New York is going to start with the brain all the way to the cornea so I am Going Inter state since we bounce back and forth. But next "" Tuesday "" we are doing the color oct and I was told if I was ready . Also they say double vision is normal . Wasn't normal started 3-4 weeks after exposure. I saw my fingers disappear while place in front of a lamp . Now I come home and close all the windows and live on the dark ( that makes me forget all this ). Physics are physics and 440mn blue/violet causes ADN/RNA changes If so the eyes will come up since life expectancy is 4 years . This was done in rabbits, monkeys , and fish. Also in culture RPE lab cells and those died . I have been told my little picosecond machine their only life purpose is to kill cells to rejuvenate the skin. Now don't buy anything off China , the Google's were the wrong ones :( aka counterfeit. Now moving forward , the pen was at low density and I was using a mirror as guide an was late after dark that's where the mathematics come into place. The exposure I would say was like 5-9 minutes max . The light bounced the mirror :( big mistake. "
10936,"Thank you. I'm quite happy with my life, now married with family. I try not to let this disease affect me, and try to stay positive. However, there are those days when I have a nice dream (where I see everything perfectly clearly), I dread getting out of bed to enter a world where things aren't. Being someone who had 25 years of KC, my advice to all the younger patients being diagnosed is to get yourself treated as soon as possible. Find the best doctor and the best treatment methods possible (depending on which country you live). I guess my biggest regret is not having access to the treatment options available now, back when I was diagnosed. Another regret is trusting a doctor that told me that KC typically doesn't progress in your 40's and not to risk any surgery (including CXL). Unfortunately, mine did progress in my 40's and now I'm looking for a CXL combination treatment. I guess better late than never. It's yours eyes! Take good care of them. Ask for a second or even third opinion to get the best advice/treatment possible. Good luck to all. "

10938,"I'll share my own KC journey to give you hope. I was diagnosed when I was 16. I had corneal cross linking when I was 18. The procedure wasn't bad. Just make sure you are keeping pace with your medications after. 8 years later (im now 26) I live a very normal life. I wear scleral contact lenses. Your doctor may recommend these to you at some point. Just know if they do, the lenses seem much more intimidating then they actually are. Now I live a fairly normal life. I put my contacts in in the morning and take them out at night. I have some minor limitations (I.e. can't really jump in a lake or anything with my contacts). But overall I live my life everyday like everyone else. I remember being in your shoes and feeling overwhelmed and scared, but just know it's definitely not the end of the world! Happy to answer any questions you may have about my experience. "
10939,"The diagnosis is not a death sentence for most of us. I was diagnosed fifty years ago. I've worn rgp lenses all that time. My vision is corrected to about 20/30 on a good day. It's frustrating at times, prone to occasional irritations and a couple minor ulcerations but it's not something I dwell on. I have a friend who had successful transplants and has near normal vision. Yes, some have had more severe cases but in the grand scheme of things it is better than many illnesses. Im not blind. It could be a lot worse. "

April 19th, i realize my eyes are burning all day, no big deal, it will probably go away. I'm a 25 year old male with no past medical history so this should solve itself. April 20th, burning is still there. I live next to a top 5 optho hospital in the US. I go into to see an optho. She sees Mild SPK and says to use PF drops 4-6x a day and use ointment at night and it should go away. 2 weeks later and it still doesn't resolve. May 5th. I see a dry eye specialist at the same academic hospital. She says my miebomian glands look great through slit lamp, my schirmer with anesthesia is 11 and 10 so a little low but still normal. She isn't concerned. She sees SPK and confirms dry eye. She gives me fluorometholone 2x a day for a month along with restasis 2x a day. She says i can use PF tears and ointment if i want which i continue. May 25th suddenly my eyes are 50% better. I can get through the day with studying until my eyes burn at night. June 2nd. I go back to the same corneal specialist who says my eyes look drier with more SPK but the inflammation has gone down. My schirmer went down to a 10 and 9 as well. Im freaking out because ive been putting in PF tears 4-6 times a day along with ointment at night and my eyes are DRIER. I feel 50% better though? She says we go by ""symptoms not signs in dry eye""<U+009D>. Shes says the steroid preservatives likely caused the increase in SPK. She said to stop it and gave me punctal plugs. She says i have no reason to have dry eyes and she expects this to go away. Here i am, 50% better and my mental health is down the trash can. What is going on and why am i a hard case? I don't wear contacts, i don't have a medication or medical history, and im a young male. Do i just have to give this more time with the punctal plugs as well? Please help. Thank you. "
10941,"A few days ago I wrote a post about night sweats that started for me a few weeks ago. Obviously I went straight to cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, whatever. I have been extremely anxious and stressed the past few months, catastrophizing everything, panic attacks, to the point I actually made the decision to go on an SSRI (Lexapro, night sweats started prior to taking it). That's a lot for me because I'm not that keen on taking anti depressants but could tell I was being out of control. My rheumatologist, the only doctor out of thirty who even diagnosed me with Soeren's and""<U+0080><U+009D>to me even though he rolls his eyes when I say it""<U+0080><U+009D>literally saved my life by diagnosing me and putting me on a saliva stimulant that stopped the debilitating drying symptoms is someone I do trust a lot. He's great. We have a good relationship. He actually saved me twice because I got covid very severely and he kept such close tabs on me (calling every single day to see what was going on and giving me meds according to symptoms). He says that he is 100% certain I do not have cancer. He sounds a little cocky but maybe he can back it up? He says he knows what cancer looks like and I do not have it. That even with the sweating, if he didn't speak to me again in five years he feels I'd be fine and never develop anything. He thinks it's anxiety related. I asked that even if it's not anxiety, could it just be bullshit? And he said 100%. Do I trust this and just move on? The sweats started the 5th of this month. Chest, neck and thigh area are sweating and damp upon waking. He said we could do more tests if it's still going on in four weeks. Do I move on? "

10943,I've only had that done when I first started using contacts. Did a trial for a day. Since I didn't know how to put them in the optician did it for me. I was around 11 so maybe he thought I wouldn't understand how. Can't say for sure if that's normal though. 
10944,I am 25 and my vision has definitely worsened the last 2 years. I have myopia and light astigmatism. My eye doctor brought up lasik to me since I'm wearing my glasses more constantly now and am scared of putting contacts on. So many Instagram celebs have been getting lasik and are perfectly fine but I have read some horror stories as well. Confused but definitely know it's something I want since I can't see myself wearing glasses constantly.

I want to see a doctor once the quarantine lets up, but in the meantime, I'm hoping someone can tell me whether or not I have more options, or give me a sense of whether I can be ""cured"" or this is just the new normal. Things I've been doing: \--Bruder eye mask for 10 minutes twice a day, sometimes more if I feel like it (provides more immediate short-term relief than anything else has) \--preservative-free eye drops several times a day \--occasional 30-second washcloth compress \--20-20-20 rule \--fish oil every morning \--humidifier I started doing the Bruder mask 11 days ago and have heard it can take two weeks to a month of daily use for it to really relieve symptoms... so I'm HOPING someone will reassure me that I'll be A-OK after a couple more weeks have passed. (And if I have to continue using it every day indefinitely, I can live with that.) But I'm really nervous that I'll just never have comfortable eyes again. Do I have any options to call in the big guns? I've heard of there being prescription drugs for this, I think Restasis, is that a worthwhile option? Thanks so much for any help!

10949,"u/barking-chicken \- Thank you!!! I have Psoriatic Arthritis and am currently on a Bio-Similar to the biologic Humira... looking back I've had Sjogren's for longer but it really started in my mouth first about 8 months ago and then the eyes 4 months ago.... She said this biologic I'm on may help with the Sjogren's too BUT looking into it I read that my Humira similar is used to treat the ""T"" side of my immune system (which is the side for the Psoriatic Arthritis) where as Sjogren's is the other side of the immune system. Under my eyes are SOOoooo PUFFY - they look like I haven't slept in weeks! And you know that fleshy part inside the corner of your eye just before your eyeball starts? There is spots on their that Bump Up (swell up). Even if my eyes don't feel dry the puffy/swelling gets worse if I don't put in liquid tears every 3 or 4 hours. Have you ever had anything like that swelling in your eyes??? Its ironic you mentioned the lungs side of things... I have an upcoming appointment with my Cardiologist to let him know who about this diagnosis as I heard that Sjogren's (along with Psoriatic Arthritis) can add to heart disease and I'm already on high blood pressure meds (since I was 36)... BUT he has a side major in Pulminariology... The reason I think you mentioning lungs as interesting is that I had a HUGE breathing issue just over 2 years ago. I couldn't catch my breath, couldn't walk more than 15 feet to the bathroom and missed over a month of work. It took over 3 weeks of heavy steroids and they were worried about clots in my lungs, but chest xrays showed nothing. I went for a breathing test after shortly after I was finally feeling better and it only showed was a small airway obstruction. And so I just was looking what you commented up and saw this medical article about ""Small airway disease associated with Soeren's syndrome"" .... [https://pubmed. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/21903371/](https://pubmed. gov/21903371/) I'm for sure going to mention this to him! And will re-address the sjogren's with my rhumatologist.

10951,"Hey all. I noticed last week that one pupil was larger than the other, after looking through old photo's I saw that it had been there for at least 15 years. I went to the opticians today and my lovely optometrist said I have physiological anisocoria and that it is nothing to worry about as my pupils are healthy and reactive. He also did a test to see the back of my eye and told me immediately that I have no tumors. He was happy with all of the results and at the end of the test just told me to take a break from screens when working at a computer. That should have calmed my anxiety but because of the very last test he did I'm now half calmed and half scared. Last Test: I had my face in front of a contraption, you know where you look through different lenses at images and whatnot. As soon as he put me in front of this I accidentally moved it with my nose, pulled it back to me and carried on, it didn't really feel right and it kept kind of moving - it was just a little loose/unstable and I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing or seeing. The last image was a red dot that the optician told me to look at and tell him how many lines I saw around it, I saw five, he said there were more and to try again. I apologised and asked if I could just adjust myself as when I sat up a little straighter the lines were becoming more apparent, as though they were there but the lens was skewed or blocking? Or these were blind spots. The image was almost like a clock face style and I couldn't see the lines/hands at 5 o clock, 8 o clock or 11 o clock. I sat up straight and adjusted the lens contraption to my face, suddenly I saw all 8 lines/hands perfectly - as clear as day with no issue. Optician seemed happy about it and I apologised because I kept accidentally moving the lens machine, he laughed and said it was fine, gave me a clear bill of eye health and told me to come back in two years. Does this sound like an issue with the positioning of the lenses or something in my brain? He said the test was to measure how well my eyes work together. I've never had an eye exam as an adult so not sure if these things can happen! I thought everything had to be perfect all of the time and hate that I had to adjust myself/position of the machine to see all of the lines!!!! Argh. In the UK if that helps with eye exams situations. ps. Have terrible health anxiety as you've probably guessed. "

10955,Thanks for replying. Sorry I get so freaked out over these things. He described it similar to dry dessert cracks kind of like biggish dots of blues and browns. Is that not what RP looks like? From the pictures online it looks to me like the cracks in the dessert but they do seem more black. Also the fact it has never grown into the centre of my eye where it would be easily visible to the optician is that unlike rp after 15 years of having it?

10970,"I have recently noticed that the vision in my left eye is blurred. I can see just fine with both eyes though. I have been noticing my left eye lid drooping a little bit in pictures as well but I thought it was nothing. When I force the eyelid up, my left eye feels dry and stings. I had my eyes tested in 2017 because I was getting pink eye rather frequently but they were fine back then (I am 20 now). Could it be myopia at this age? Or is it something more serious? Will I need glasses if I can see just fine now? "
10971,"I have had glasses since I was 8, and contacts since I was in middle school. I've never had any issues with them until recently (28yrs old). After my annual in August, I've been back to my eye doctor multiple times, tried multiple trial contacts (both dailies and biweekly), and they can't seem to figure out how to solve my problem. My contact prescription seems fine, but when I am looking at something near (ex: my phone / a book), then look up at something in the distance, the far away object is blurry. I need to blink a few times before it comes into focus and I can see it clearly. This is not an issue when I wear my glasses which have the same prescription. My eye doctor has confirmed that my prescription is correct and my lenses are fitting great on my eye and not rotating or moving (which was the initial concern because I have astigmatism). It's been a frustrating 4 months of wearing contacts that take seconds to adjust from nearsighted reading to farsighted reading. Any guesses? "
10972,"Hello, If you don't get the doubling when you look through a pinhole, then it can be a variety of causes ranging from uncorrected astigmatism, cataracts, dry eyes. Since you don't have dry eyes and cataracts are unlikely because you're 24, your cause is likely uncorrected astigmatism. However, if glasses can't provide a satisfactory solution then I recommend taking what's called aberrometry. It measures your eye's imperfections and helps doctors see and understand how you actually see. Aside from that, prisms aren't related to this. Prisms are used for patients with ocular deviations to ""shift one of their two visual fields to make them see one instead of two. "
10973,"All of the studies are on children, so the evidence is there for arresting progression in children but cannot say in adults as it hasn't been studied. Many people continue to see myopic progression into their 30s so it may be a worthwhile regimen for adults provided they can tolerate it. "

10975,"Hey there. I just got back from a consultation for a possible tPRK + CXL for both of my eyes. Here is what I found out. This one particular doctor said they need to remove up to 100 microns of corneal tissue to perform the procedure. Epithelium itself is 50 microns alone. Doctors said they will not go less than 400 microns, which means that they want the corneal thickness to be around 500 microns before the procedure is started. The closer you are to 400 microns, the less tissue the doctor can work with for tPRK. My left eye is at around 540 microns, but my right eye (which is worse) is at the borderline of 490 microns. The doctor said he can still do tPRK on both of my eyes, but my right side is on the borderline, and warned me that my right eye visual acuity will improve, but not by much after tPRK because of its thinness margin. If you already had CXL, then seek out doctors that are experienced in performing tPRK after. Some doctors prefer doing tPRK + CXL at the same time, where as others prefer doing them separately. You want to make sure the doctor that you go see is the one that has experience doing tPRK on eyes that already had CXL treatment. If you direct message me, I can share such doctors in the US that are willing to do tPRK on post-CXL patient. "
10976,"For about a year now I've had my tear duct blocked on and off. I saw an eye doctor in april and they recommended surgery after trying to spray water through a canula through my duct and it just resurfaced at my eye. However, the very next day after that my eye was back to normal for about 2 months until I started getting tearing on/off but nothing too bothersome so I just canceled the surgery and moved on. I usually just pushed any build up back out of my eye occasionally as needed and it was fine for many months. 2 weeks ago though my eye started going nuts and I started getting sinus pain around the bridge of my nose (which is new). It seems like the location of the blockage is changing because initially the blockage was right at the duct, now it seems to be deeper in the bridge of my nose. It's not too bad when I'm indoors, but when I go outside it becomes unbearable. I've tried everything from valsava manuever to neti pots, to fluticasone, to just rubbing the hell out of my nose/eye socket... I am able to clear the pain in my duct with pressure and blowing my nose, but it comes back pretty quickly and I have sinus headaches too now. Is there anything else I can try before surgery? I already have antibiotics going. Should I ask the eye doctor if they can try to flush it or something? This all started like 10 years ago when I first had a watery eye episode and it went away then came back about 5 years ago and then again a year ago, but only last year and now has it been so bad that it's become infected and not cleared up on it's own. When I went to the eye doctor in april they only tried to shoot water through it with the canula to check for a blockage, they just recommended surgery and sent me on my way, which really rubbed me the wrong way at the time.

10978,"He has compound hyperopic astigmatism, a refractive error that is a combination of [hyperopia](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/hyperopia-farsightedness) and [astigmatism](https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-astigmatism). You will undoubtedly get varying opinions on the subject of hyperopia, even among eye professionals. Almost all of us recognize some level of hyperopia is normal and acceptable at a young age, but we may disagree on how much. Personally, I act based on symptoms and coexisting exam data (for example, if patient shows signs of strabismus or amblyopia which can be made worse by hyperopia, it makes me more likely to correct it). Similarly when it comes to astigmatism, the need for correction at a young age partially depends on associated signs and symptoms. Though, at his level of correction, he probably experiences at least mild symptoms. I'd pretty much always correct that much astigmatism. Not knowing the details of the case, I can't tell you how bad the vision is. However, assuming no symptoms and all other exam data is normal, a prescription like that isn't so bad. I'd expect he would be able to manage without glasses, but the quality of life would almost definitely be improved by wearing them. Or, if rating on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most extreme blur ever and 0 being perfect vision, he is probably about a 3, give or take. Of course could be better or worse if I'm not considering information I have no way of knowing over the internet (such as latent hyperopia, wet refraction, or whether or not the script you were given is a reduced form of his true refraction results). Edit: one last thing. I thought you ought to know eye exams for small children are often ""rushed"" on purpose. Typically, if you take too long or spend too much time explaining things you lose the child's attention and that can compromises the value of the test data moving forward. So some of that hurried feeling may actually have been normal. "

10981,"I'm 36 and was diagnosed with ""early age-related presbyopia"" 2 years ago and received a prescription for ""readers"". About 6 months ago I started getting headaches and experiencing eye strain when looking at the computer screen or my phone so I tried using the ""readers"" which felt too strong for that use. In July of 2020 they used my readers prescription to convert it to a ""computer glasses"" prescription (due to me being hesitant to get a new exam / prescription because of COVID). Unfortunately, I'm already feeling eye strain and getting headaches again when using these devices with my computer glasses. I've tried on the old ""readers"" and the prescription feels ""off"", but not nearly as overly strong as it originally did. I'm guessing my presbyopia has progressed, and the updated ""computer"" prescription (using a year old ""readers"" prescription) was made too weak. Does that sound reasonable, or would you be concerned by how quickly things have progressed? Also, anything you'd recommend bringing up at my appointment? I didn't know ""computer glasses"" were different from ""reading glasses"", so I'd love to hear feedback on other things to mention that might not be obvious. Other factors to consider: * Diabetic (Under control - A1C of 6.4 - 7.4 for many years) * Original prescription for my ""reading glasses"" wasn't as strong as typical ""readers"" that you would buy online without a prescription. * Slight astigmatism * Previously had Lasik to correct nearsightedness (roughly 8 - 12 years ago).

10982,"There are many different types of variable focus lenses, each one has qualities that you might find preferable to the all-distances variable lenses - depending on your visual demands. As someone mentioned, if your distance vision is clear, and you see well without glasses, you might prefer Shamir Computer, or Zeiss Gradal RD designs. These offer clear vision to approximately 10 feet (3 m) and have a much wider field of view, for computer, and close-up reading activities. In addition, you don't have to raise your head as much to get into the effective areas of the lens. "

They have made glasses up to - 100+ so youll be able to see fine corrected and above a - 30 is pretty much unheard of. A lot of people are still growing and changing at 19 you will likely stabilise and not increase much more im not a doctor so please talk to a professional to put your mind at ease if needed as they can give you accurate information personal to your case. Best of luck. "
10984,"My prescription is pretty small compared to yours. .5 in both cyl and sph on my left eye and .25 on both in my right eye. I also went years before noticing, mostly because my right eye would compensate for my left eye. Now that I have glasses though, it's surprising how blurry everything has been without me noticing. "
10985,I have spent a majority of my days for the last 2 years searching for any programs or opportunities available for dental restoration and sjogren's. I'm 27 and my teeth just keep crumbling. Any information you have about insurance or how you came upon this information would be greatly appreciated! 
10986,I had a detached retina in my 20's. Got a scleral buckle and then the lens had to be replaced (I got a cataract). I would talk to your ophthalmologist regarding the medical marijuana. 
10987,"Hey! I'm 23 and went to the Optometrist and Optho and they said it's likely just familial drusen and that it's very hereditary and it's just like freckles but still eat leafy greens, antioxidants, omega 3s and live a healthy life. "
10988,"yeah at the same time as the buckle. Then the peel procedure maybe 2-3 months later. Then about 1-2 years later I had cataract surgery. My eye is ok, especially with glasses but I needed the peel b/c the scar tissue had puckered up my retina so everything was wavy. My retina is flat now but hard to get rid of ALL the imperfections so it doesn't see the same as my good eye (and my pupil stays small - it never grows bigger so nighttime can be hard). But with contacts or glasses i'm pretty close to 20/20. BUT I had gotten Lasik surgery years ago so we were working off of 20/20 vision before any of my retina stuff happened. If I had not had Lasik I don't show what the situation would be. "
10989,"In 35 and am also having difficulty adapting to new contacts. Things that are clear with my glasses appear fuzzy. My close distance sight.is great with contacts, but it's only when I'm trying to read text from a distance, like on a computer or TV, that I have issues. I had ever experienced these issues before, when I had contacts in high school and college. Contacts were always sharper than glasses, I imagine due to their distance to the eye. Now though, I'm on my third pair of trials. I'm not sure if I have to ""get used to them"" but I never remember having to put a lot of time into my old contacts. Oddly enough, when I look out to the side of my contacts in my peripheral vision, it's much clearer than looking out the center of my contacts. It's very weird. "
10990,Oh I see! So if I'm 30 and haven't been diagnosed with it I should likely be okay right? 
10991,"Been wearing contacts for over 20 years. I made the horrible choice of sleeping in my contacts for about 8 of years, wearing old contacts, etc. Even after stopping overnight wear I still wore them pretty much every waking moment. I've developed a bit of blurred vision in my right eye that the doctor said was due to contact over wear for obvious reasons. I got a prescription for new glasses/contacts, switched to daily contacts which I try to only wear for a few hours max a day. I got a new pair of glasses to go with the prescription as well but even after a few months of trying to wear them in the mornings/evenings I still can't get used to them. They cause me to strain a lot, causing headaches and neck pain. I'm not sure why because they seem right and I can see fine through them. Is it just that I haven't had enough time to adjust after not wearing glasses for over 20 years? It's pretty difficult to wear them all day for that reason. Its really uncomfortable. Should I go and spend the money on getting a new exam? "
10992,"I'm a 63 year old healthy male. medium nearsighted since my teens, though wearing bifocals in the last ten or fifteen years. I have cataract surgery next week for my left (non-dominant) eye. The right (dominant) eye is about a -2 they told me. No signs of pending cataract surgery needed in that eye. Not much astigmatism in the left eye either. Healthy retinas. I usually take my bifocals off to use the computer these days. But I wear glasses for biking etc. The ophthalmologist suggested that I may want him to set the left eye for distance, and just try to adapt to the resulting monovision, since the right eye is already pretty good for close/intermediate reading. This way I might not need glasses in many situations, except maybe for sustained reading or night driving. He said most of his patients adapt to this after a few weeks. If not, I can always start to wear glasses again. The alternative (for monofocal lenses) is to set it for close or intermediate. Any thoughts about this monovision strategy vs the more conservative approach? (Am not really interested in multifocal lenses... don't want the night vision stars). "
10993,"Thanks for the information! I'm 28, I got it done last year. So it's now been a year and slightly progressed. That's why I'm a little concerned about getting it done again. Like, well it didn't work the first time why will it work this time? And I have scarring that does not allow me to have completely corrected vision and I do not want that to get worse. "
10994,So my pressures are usually anywhere from 19-22 with my cornea thickness that's considered totally normal though? My ophthalmologist still uses the scale and he's a specialty guy. I suppose different methods different regions. Still he said the Icare's etc often overestimate iop a bit regardless just in general and I've never had GAT done. 
10995,"Wondering if this is normal or if there may be something wrong. **Background**: I have never had an eye exam, and have an appointment with my GP soon and will set one up. I'm 30 years old and last summer I decided to go back to school and with all the reading and computer time I realized that I needed reading glasses, especially at the end of the day when my eyes are tired and have a hard time focusing. +1.5 seems to work well for me in the over the counter reading glasses. **Issue**: I definitely notice that my left eye is worse than my right, the vision of the left eye is a little more blurry, and the eye has always been set a little more forward than the other eye, causing the eyelid to sit lower, and the eye to appear slightly smaller. This has been the case since I was born. I have recently become aware of the fact that when I close just my left eye, everything looks normal and clear, but if I only close my right eye, it's as if the right side of my field of vision of my left eye is like looking through dark veil. I don't think this is a super new thing, just that I just noticed it. It's almost as if I am seeing the inside of my eyelid with my right eye, and that picture is overlapping the picture from my left eye. But why does this not happen when I close my left eye? Is my right eye the dominant one and still trying to take over even when it is closed? I don't know if this makes any sense, and I'm having a hard time figuring out how to explain it, but I hope someone can offer some kind of explanation! I've been having some new anxiety recently caused by some strange symptoms of hair loss and night sweats, and have been going through all sorts of lab workups and x-rays trying to rule out things like lymphoma and trying to figure out the cause. So now with realizing this about my eye, my thoughts are going to brain tumor or something and I'm freaking out a little. Hoping someone can tell me this is normal! But like I said, I will be having an eye exam soon. Thank you in advance! "
10996,"Hello. I'm a retired veteran and have had keratoconus in both eyes for 20 years. Over the past year or so, I have been having migraines that put me out of commission. Could my KC be causing my migraines? Thanks! "
10997,"As the title and handle suggest, I (20 F) made this account to ask this question specifically. Recently, I've been compulsively pressing my eyes for as much as 45 minutes at a time. (I have OCD and high-functioning autism and I'm working on it, but life gets in the way and holding my eyes inside my head is the least of my worries right now.) I am not rubbing the eye, just pressing with the heel of my hand, so I don't think I'm likely to have issues with abrasions or keratoconus. While I'm doing it, I feel mild discomfort inside my nose (similar to how it feels to get water up my nose), my eyes tear up a lot, and I see some phosphenes (particularly at first, but they go away after a while). But seeing as (pun unintended) my vision is completely black for as much as 30 seconds after and comes back extremely gradually, I am starting to worry whether I am causing internal damage to the retina doing this, or on what timeline I'd be doing so. Apart from this habit, the only visual problem I have is mild hyperopia, though I do have a family history of cataracts and glaucoma. TL;DR: I smush my eyes for up to 45 minutes at a time... am I screwed now? Later? How so? "

11000,"You've clearly made up your mind, so why are you here? If the answers you're getting aren't matching what you expected, then I don't know what else I can help you with because we're all giving you honesty. I literally have nothing to lose or gain from this conversation, so why would I give you anything other than my honest opinion? As with any industry, buying power comes from numbers. Places like Lenscrafters, Costco and Walmart able to make large profits on markup just as they do with any other product because they purchase mass quantities. But small businesses, owned by the doctors, don't have that buying power. If you think Luxottica is selling designer frames to small optometrists for $20 only to be marked in the hundreds for consumers, you're just flat out wrong. We still pay hundreds for frames, for lenses, etc. I have plenty of frames from online retailers, but I personally put better quality lenses from our own lab into those frames because I understand what kind of lens I would get from online retailers. It's not a trade secret, you pay garbage you get garbage. The repercussions of Gucci shoes vs. non designer is maybe just that your shoes fall apart faster. The repercussions of poor quality online lenses vs in-store lens is literally the functionality of the entire lens. Did the online store measure your optical centre? Did they discuss material density and optical quality? Or base curve and it's distortion of your astigmatism? Its not a facade, I don't recommend an anti-glare coating just because I want you to spend more. I recommend it because I'm pretty sure you'll prefer it, and it saves me from the hassle of you returning with issues because the reflections give you headaches. I don't work on commission, I just want you to be happy with your vision. "
